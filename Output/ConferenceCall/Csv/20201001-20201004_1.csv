PRESENTATION
Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
A very warm welcome to all joining this call today. With me here today also, I have our CFO, Paul Victor; and Brad Griffith, Executive Vice President,
Chemicals business. By now, I'm sure you would have read and had a chance to go through this morning's announcement relating to our proposed
U.S.-based Chemicals business joint venture with LyondellBasell. This is a really important step for us, both strategically and financially. Financially,
the USD 2 billion of upfront proceeds that we will receive are a meaningful set, bringing leverage down. We will be a 50% joint venture partner
going forward, and so we will also participate equally in the upside in the event that macro conditions recover.

More than this, however, this is also a very positive strategic step. The transaction contributes to shifting the profile of the Chemicals business away
from commodity to Specialty Chemicals. This is aligned with our strategy and consistent with our objective for the future Sasol business that will
assist in improving profitability through the cycle. This is significantly helped by the fact that we will maintain value chain integration to help
protect the profitability of the performance Chemicals business. This is a win-win process.

This morning's announcement set up much of the information, but we wanted to use this call to lay out some terms of the transaction, the scope,
the pathway forward and answer any questions that you may have.

Let me start by walking through the key terms of the transaction. By way of background, I think it's important to say that we got you after an
extensive competitive process through which we explored a number of different transaction constructs with different partners. It was this proposal
that offered us the best mix of upfront and long-term value whilst helping us accelerate delivery of our strategy.

The partnership is with LyondellBasell. I'm sure that many on the call will be familiar with it, but for those that are not, they are one of the largest
global producers of plastics, chemicals and refined products. They are currently the third largest producer of ethylene in North America as well as
being the leading producer in Europe.

LyondellBasell, therefore, have a breadth of operating expertise in commodity chemicals that few can match. The U.S. headquarters is -- and the
U.S. headquarters and executive leadership are based in Houston, close to Lake Charles. Therefore, I believe we have a very strong partner, and the
Sasol team is excited to work with them going forward.

LyondellBasell will pay us USD 2 billion for the 50% of the JV at completion, subject to any closing adjustments. The new JV is to be called Louisiana
Integrated Polyethylene and LyondellBasell will be the operator on behalf of the JV. Each JV partner will provide their pro rata share of ethylene
feedstocks and will also grow out the share of ethylene and polyethylene products at cost.

The transaction will be subject to a few key conditions precedent, which I will talk to you later, but we are hoping to close these out before the end
of 2020.

It's important to clarify that Sasol will retain the U.S. Performance Chemicals business in its entirety. That includes the new Ziegler alcohol plant,
the ethylene oxide and derivative plants and the Guerbet alcohol plant. The transaction will, therefore, have the effect of rapidly shifting our
portfolio towards Specialty Chemicals, which is in line with our strategy shared during our Capital Markets Day in 2017 and reaffirmed in June this
year.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We will also, however, protect our integrated value chain by retaining access to our share of the low-cost, on-site ethylene produced as well as
ethylene from the existing plant. And this will help protect the profitability of our U.S. Performance Chemicals business through the cycle. It's exactly
this through the cycle, quality of earnings that we are pushing for in the move away from commodity chemicals. Sasol's remaining 50% base
chemicals exposure bodes well for participating in the commodity chemicals market recovery over the next few years.

The next slide aims to outline the Sasol transaction and the remaining business which Sasol will retain in the U.S. The assets that will go into the
joint venture, including the recently constructed 1.5 billion ton per annum ethane cracker, the low-density polyethylene and linear low-density
polyethylene plants with a combined capacity of approximately 900 kilotons per annum and associated utilities and infrastructure relating to these
units. The land on which those assets are based will also be part of the JV.

For the avoidance of doubt, the original ethylene cracker, together with the Gemini joint venture for high-density polyethylene and phenolics
business are excluded from the transaction as well as the U.S. Performance Chemicals business.

As a reminder, the Performance Chemicals business consists of the ethylene oxide and derivative units, the Ziegler alcohol unit, the alumina unit
and the Guerbet alcohol unit. Other legacy Performance Chemicals units are also excluded.

As I mentioned before, LyondellBasell will operate the JV assets. There will be a tolling agreement in place for the conversion of ethane into ethylene
and ethylene conversion into polyethylene. The intention is, therefore, for the relevant employees to be transferred to LyondellBasell when the JV
has controlled. The JV will underline on which it operates, but Sasol retains ownership of the remainder of the property and therefore, able to use
vacant land for any potential growth opportunities in future. Profitability of our integrated value chain will be preserved by retaining access to our
share of the low-cost on-site produced ethylene as well as ethylene from the regional plant.

Steady-state volumes for the LCCP cracker remains at 1.5 million tons per annum and approximately 0.9 million tons collectively of polyethylene
capacity once fully ramped up. Sasol will, therefore, own 50% of these volumes after completion of the transaction. Full ownership of our existing
crackers is retained with around 460 kilotons per annum ethylene capacity.

The transaction is subject to several conditions precedent. The key ones being the approval by Sasol shareholders and relevant regulatory clearances.
A circular will be made available to Sasol shareholders in October, containing full details of the transaction, and we are hoping to obtain the relevant
shareholder approval at our Annual General Meeting, which is due to be held on November 22.

As I said earlier, we are aiming to close the transaction before the end of 2020, but that's obviously subject to receiving the various regulatory
clearances here. We are not anticipating any particular concerns, but in the current situation, we are aware that some regulatory processes are
taking longer than they normally would do. So there is, of course, some risk that it may fall into early 2021.

This transaction represents a meaningful step forward in our deleveraging path, which I talked about in August when we announced our financial
year 2020 results. Proceeds from asset disposals, together with cash unlocked from our self-out measures are significant contributors towards
reducing our net debt. For financial year '21, we will continue to execute against our response plan objectives to keep liquidity strong and further
bring our leverage down.

The final major step on our deleveraging pathway is the rights issue to be executed in the second half of financial year 2021. We want to implement
this when the amount required is well defined, and we can also do so on the basis of a key clearer and stronger financial position. The amount to
be raised remains subject to prevailing operating and market conditions as well as any further asset disposals.

In addition, we are progressing our Sasol 2.0 initiative to support the reset of the organization to be sustainably profitable in a low oil price
environment. More information on this will be shared at our investor update to be held later in this year.

In conclusion, this transaction really is a big step forward for us. It's an integral part of the deleveraging pathway to get us back to a sustainable
balance sheet, and it also accelerates delivery of our strategy.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Thank you, and we can now open the conference call for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
The first question is on the financials. Do you expect further impairments in the U.S.-based Chemicals business post the LCCP stake sale today? And
that's from Sashank Lanka.

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Thank you, Sashank. Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon, Sashank. When we released our financial results, we did give you indication that
the fair valuation of the bid range that we received from bidents informed our impairment write-down. Based on that, we don't envisage any
impairments. Of course, one needs to assess the macroeconomic situation as at the 31st of December and outlook at that point in time. If that
deteriorates, of course, there will be pressure. But if it improves, there is a possibility of a reversal of impairment. Our take at this point in time is
the level at which we think valued the asset in the U.S. is very much sufficiently valued. And given today's macroeconomic outlook, no further
impairments will be required.

On the contrary, previous impairment write-downs that were made on the Performance Chemicals had indicated a vast improvement since June
in terms of long-term forecast, and that may result in the reversal of the impairment on the PC side of the business, but like I said, that's what we
know today. Three months is a long time in the world economy, and things can change. But what we know today, local impairments involve a --
kind of a virtual impairments may be (inaudible).

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
The next question, thank you, Paul, is from [Gerhard]. If you are pushing away from commodity chemicals, why not sell 100% of the polyethylene
plants?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thanks, [Gerhard], for that question. I think we have said that the commodity cycle currently is at the low end. And therefore, we believe that the
construct, as I've explained earlier, that this proposal of selling at this point or JV, 50% offered us the best mix of upfront and long-term value
because we would participate in the upside as the commodity cycle recovers. And therefore, when we exit the last 50% or the remainder 50%, we
believe the fair market value would look different to what it could be today. And therefore, this approach for us in a stepwise manner is the best
value that we could derive for shareholders.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Okay. Thank you, Fleetwood. Maybe another question on the financials from Adrian Hammond. How has (inaudible) influenced your views on
EBITDA expectations for LCCP? Are your last steady-state EBITDA estimates of $1 billion still in place? Or has this changed following the sale?

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
I will deal with that. Thanks for the question, Adrian. Of course, our thinking on (inaudible) thinking on the margins and pricing is (inaudible) thinking
on margin and pricing. We have to do a valuation based on what we believe the pricing is. My sense is that both of the parties, ourselves and
themselves, do pay a lot of attention in terms of the economic tests such as IHS and Wood Mac in terms of pricing. But then, of course, you need

                                                                                                                                                                             
 to do your only netback calculations. We do believe based on our assessment of the EBITDA ranges, which I will give you just now is that we've got
a market related and fit value for the 50%, given where pricing sits in the commodity chemicals price.

Having said that, we did say that -- in the same announcement that as soon as we issue those circular and also to take into the full impact of Laura
when we issue that at the end -- late in October, we will then host a conference call to provide you with a further update on what the final impact
of Laura is specifically on the EBITDAs for financial year '21 for the Charles asset.

And then more importantly, we will also need to then provide the sense of what the outlook is and especially, the ultimate $1 billion run rate up
before. One of that run rate will be in 100% ownership. And then what it will look like after we have sold our 50% portion of the commodity
chemicals. So that's scheduled for late in October. And the only reason why we don't release it today is really as a result of the overall developments.
We just want to kind of get our minds around that. So we create a very accurate and clear target and outlook out for financial '21, but we'll also
give you an update on the steady-state EBITDA rate for our portion going forward there.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Okay. Thanks, Paul. The next question is, when will the LDPE plant begin BO? Is that still targeted for the end of October? And can you give us an
update of the impact of the hurricane on the plant on LCCP, particularly?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Yes. Thanks, Alex. So the current plans to start up after the impact of Hurricane Laura is driven by the utility provider of electricity into the site.
There a reliable supply of high-voltage power into the site has been communicated to the market and also to us, and we stay in very close contact
with them on a daily basis virtually. And that is that by early to mid-October, all of that would be restored.

Now as we speak, we have commenced with some commissioning activities of many units over the site. Suffice to say, the linear low and the LD
units are also in that mode of early commissioning activities. And the delivery of reliable power remains as predicated by the service provider. We
will still have beneficial operations of the LD unit target for October. So that is still in play. And with the risk of reliable energy or electricity supply
into the site. That's the only provider.

I think then with respect to the other impacts of Laura, as Paul has mentioned, we will provide an update later in the year, but specifically, not later
than our metrics to the market in October.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Fleetwood. There is a question from Chris Nicholson. Could you provide further detail on the synergies or upside you expect arising
from access to Lyondell's customer base or supply chain? And will it accelerate or increase the targeted 60% of volumes to be placed in the U.S.
contract market?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
So I'm going to ask Brad to give us a feedback on this question. Brad, if you wish.

Brad V. Griffith - Sasol Limited - EVP of Chemicals
Yes. Thanks, Fleetwood. Sorry, there's an echo there. You'll probably have to mute there in your commentary. I think, Chris, for the question, we
will be putting in place a marketing agreement for the JV with our partner, LyondellBasell. We are still working through those arrangements. Those
would only take place after closing. So it's too early for me to be able to comment on what we would expect around the customer base. But as

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Fleetwood described in the presentation, we're very pleased to have LyondellBasell as our partner. They're well positioned in the marketplace, and
we'll be able to communicate more on that as the JV is formed.

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thank you, Brad.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Brad. I think the next question we have from [Gerhard], which is related to marketing is, are there still -- are there or will there be joint
marketing agreements in place to sell -- in place between Lyondell and Sasol? Or will each company market and sell its own share of production?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Yes. I think, [Gerhard], as Brad just explained, we are in discussions to finalize that marketing agreement by LyondellBasell. That would happen
once the deal is closed to that point in time. Of course, Sasol market and sell its own polyethylene products to the market.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
One more question with regard to the ethylene supply. For the ethylene that you'll get from the joint venture, LIP, do you need to pay market
prices? That question is from Alexandre [Samaji].

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Alexandre, as I've indicated, this is a manufacturing joint venture that means each partner get its producer economics. So we would get our ethylene
based on our ethane input at costs from the cracker. And therefore, we will not pay market prices for the ethylene that we consume in any other
downstream derivative plant.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you. The next question is from [Wade Napier]. Wade's next question is does selling 50% of the cracker not reduce the attractiveness of
brownfield expansions? If we run the ethylene mass balance, 50% of the LCCP's cracker plus the legacy cracker matches current feedstock demand
from LCCP's Performance Chemicals. 50% of LCCP's base chemicals, 50% of Project Gemini and other legacy needs. Have you, in fact, discussed
future ethylene offtake agreements with LyondellBasell for when you inevitably undertake brownfield expansion and don't have enough ethylene?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thank you. That's a very good question, and we have made provision for that. So we have agreed with our partner that future cracker expansions
will be such that Sasol could participate in such expansions for the needs and growth of our Performance Chemicals business. So yes, we have
made provision for that. And it's basically, on the condominium cracker concept, where each partner will contribute the capital for the relevant
portion of offtake. And of course, Sasol would be requested to have access, and we can then elect to participate or not participate, depending on
the time of when this comes to play.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Fleetwood. We have a question on the rights issue. Can you please be specific what are you exactly targeting in your decision to do the
rights issue and the size of the rights issue? Is it the debt covenant? Do you want to get net debt down to $4 billion? Or do you want to reduce your
net debt by $6 billion? Do you include the lease liabilities when you think about net debt? That's a question from Gerhard Engelbrecht.

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Thank you, Gerhard. We've been -- I think what comes first, we have said that in Sasol 2.0, we want to lead ourselves and design an organization
that can be sustainable in a 45 modeling world, meaning that it has the right to deliver a system return on assets as well as having a certain level
of uptake on the balance sheet in that specific environment.

In that environment, a big label of $4 billion is ultimately needed to ensure that it matches the kind of cash flow generating ability in a pretty
fast-moving world. Is there an exact science for a specific outcome of the target? No, it's not. We will, as part of Sasol 2.0, look at various scenarios
and various outcomes and the debt may fluctuate around the $4 billion absolute. It might be higher, depending on kind of what we envisage will
be sustainable in the business. However, what is very kind of critical is a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA level. I think not only from a rating agencies
perspective, we want to back to investment grade, maintaining a certain level of net debt-to-EBITDA debt ratio is quite critical. And that's the reason
have certain thresholds in place. Typically, Moody's will have 2.5x negative EBITDA as a criteria for you to become investment grade. You have to
show that you can do it on a sustainable basis. So that metric in itself is actually very important.

Now we want to come to the other part of the question to say, so what will the thinking be ultimately in deciding on a right issue. And the thinking
is exactly the same as what we've discussed with you during the road show. We are targeting quite heavily at the [self-out] measures, the [$1] billion
of (inaudible), which we achieved and we are targeting another $1 billion. But we might still achieve this year's $1 billion. So far so good. The results
for the first 2 months have been quite promising, and we do have a reason to believe that at this rate, we will be able to deliver on the $1 billion
target. Well, if we overachieve the market, it's volatile to tell in terms of exactly how we -- where we find ourselves, and we have seen with the
macroeconomics, it can change quite quickly either up or down. So we have to be quite cautious about that.

So that was the first step that we said to you we will monitor and watch closely. We are not behind that number, but we're not super ahead of that
number either, but we're on our run rate in terms of the performance.

Then secondly is, we did say that we want to see how much of our asset disposals we can deliver, and we started at $2 billion to $4 billion. Now
ultimately, with this deal, we are obviously moving towards the -- moving to the higher end of that range, which is quite positive. Shareholders
will still approve this transaction, but it's very positive that we made good progress with the asset disposals.

Thirdly, we did say that we will need to position ourselves for 2.0 to you as investors in November so that you can give a sense of what are we
targeting as a sustainable business and how far are we from it and what decisions are needed to get us there. And the rights issue might not be
required in terms of that. We will only make this final decision as we communicated to you in terms of the ticket size of the rights issue in February.
We are still committed to say, it is a smallish amount needed to reset the balance sheet, meaning below $1 billion. I think the need for a rights issue
is probably not there, and one will probably want to see if you can't deal with it in other ways, potentially selling more assets and below weighted
average cost of capital.

We'll try to see what other levers you can pull. But if a more sizable rights issue is needed, then we should do that as well, but we shouldn't be
scared of doing that. But we cannot today tell you whether it's not going to go into what the ticket size is. I've seen a lot of the commentary that
the sell-side did push in the market today was commenting on this deal should put -- take the pressure off of a higher rights issue, and likely so.
But it is an important deal for us. And if the cash flows, it will make a significant difference on the net debt-to-EBITDA. It will help us to get to those
-- below those capital target of 3x that's currently the government level -- target as at the 30th of June of next year.

So we've done it very carefully. Consider all of this, ultimately, the shareholders have to vote on it. And shareholders will not vote if they think it's
not needed. Our shareholders will also be able reminded, we believe, that if it is needed for the sustainability of the business that, that rights issue

                                                                                                                                                                             
 will pass in what -- in which shape or form. So this is where we find ourselves. It's too early to say, but definitely, the pressure is starting to improve
and swinging more towards a more improved balance sheet risk, and hence, we can make more careful decisions on rights when we get there.
Hopefully, it answers your questions.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you. The next question is by Adrian Hammond. Are you concerned about covenants if the deal does not close by the end of December? And
then linked to that, the termination of the underwriting agreement, is that perhaps hinting at a significantly lower amount that may not warrant
the underwriting is a question by Herbert.

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
I think it's two very good questions that Herbert asked. So ultimately, the deal is still subject to shareholders' approval. And if the shareholders
don't approve the deal, then obviously, it will -- it can put those covenants at all times under risk. That can definitely be the case. But then ultimately,
if shareholders do approve and the fact that we have a (inaudible), we do believe that we have a reasonable prospect to negotiate with banks away
to pass-through on the half year end, even with cash flows not flowing. So usually what banks will consider is if you've got these terms buttoned
up and the risk is really below the cash model flow, then ultimately, the banks will allow the company to make other (inaudible) as if the cash did
flow at half year end, and hence, we will be able to navigate and pass the test effectively with those providers and now by the banks. We will
effectively engage quite actively now with our lender group, now that we have kind of the key terms buttoned up. And we do believe that it really
gives the banks also the comfort that, ultimately, we are making good progress here. And this is what they want to see, and the cash will be coming
to service the balance sheet.

To the other part of your question that -- sorry, can you repeat the question again?

I think the other part is on the underwriting. So underwriting does come at a cost. And we made a decision with the involvement of our major
shareholders to stop the underwriting because we know that the rights issue we seek there is only due in February. Why do you want to pay
underwriting fees for something that may require certain variables to play out on a rights issue if we issue that? So it means we made a decision
in collaboration with our shareholders to stop the softer underwriting. And only once we get better clarity on the potential rights issue, we will
then consider to be introduce it. If it's going to be small in a scenario where the issuance of the right issues to the smaller side, then probably the
need for soft underwriting is not necessary where it becomes bigger than, of course, you need it. But I think it's quite important, shareholders also
have the right to participate and soft underwrite the shares. And if the shareholders wishes to do so, some shareholders did give indications that
they may be keen to do that rather than to get the lender group involved, we will also consider it, which is quite usual for a process like this. So at
this point in time, I think it makes good sense not to have it in place. It's (inaudible) of not having it. Shareholders have been informed and will
watch this space in terms of how we want to position the stock and how we want (inaudible).

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Paul. The next question is from Faisal at Goldman Sachs. It's at what point would you consider saying the remaining 50%? And does
your partner have the option to increase its share to 100% at a certain point in time?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thank you, Faisal. I think we're very clear on this that the future sale of the remaining 50% is not on a fixed manner. It's at a fair market value. Lyondell
can make us an offer. We can offer them to exit. There is no put or call at all in the agreement. Therefore, it will be assessed at a future point in time,
and we've also agreed with our partner that, that future point in time would be at least 2 years from now that we will assess the next step.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Fleetwood. A question from [Mike Townsend] is, can Sasol continue to hedge ethane inputs into the cracker? Or will this be managed
within the JV? And have you made any further progress on hedging?

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Yes. Well, the question is, do you want to hedge your exposure? We still have a 50% exposure of ethane ultimately to the EBITDA just on the
commodity chemical business, and you've still got that full exposure on the current legacy assets as well as your PC business or your specialty
chemical business. As part of our '18 strategy, we will definitely consider, what the exposure is post the 50% sale of the commodity chemical
business. And what is the capital ratio we plan to put in place because it's our balance sheet that still needs to be managed from the remainder of
EBITDA, so it'll be coming from the remainder assets. So they can keep part of future (inaudible) for us. And our 50% portion is definitely kind of
up for hedging. It's one decision that you need to make in collaboration with a partner. It's your transaction, it's your decision, and it's your [business].
So those things are really being left to each partner to decide how they want to cover their process on that.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
There's a question, I think, from Herbert. Are we able to provide any update on other asset disposals at this point in time?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
I think, Herbert, as far as the other asset disposal program is going, yes, we're working those agendas in terms of the prospects. We haven't got any
further details we could share with you today. Suffice to say that once we're in a position to share such details, we will communicate to market. But
the processes are still running, and we will update when we're in a position.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Okay. Thank you, Fleetwood. There is a question around after the sale is completed and the proceeds received, what do we expect the interest
cost to decline by in half 2 FY '21?

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Thanks. A very specific question. We will also provide you with an updated guidance on interest. I don't think it will make such a big difference. We
have -- I think we can really get the forecast that we gave was around about ZAR 8 billion in terms of interest. So depending on where the cash
flows and what -- and when it flows, ultimately that $2 billion will make a dent in the interest charge for financial year '21. I think at this point in
time, jumping at what 6 months of interest may be at $2 billion for financial '21, I think that would be a good derivative fund investment. How we
do that (inaudible) to a quick sum. But I think the more important thing is to say, what big balance do we lead ourselves towards the end of June
and what is the interest charge going forward for financial year '21. I think that's the one that we will provide update on as we progress with these
asset disposals, but we're making good progress in terms of that.

And then I would also like to say that we've been quite successful in our tax structure in terms of our U.S. assets. And typically, flows like this will
help us to delever the U.S. balance sheet quite significantly, which makes that interest component that's currently ineffective, the treated ethanol
tax reconciliation, that will make it actually effective because your ratio of debt to equity are then effectively -- significantly improves and hence
there's more debt capacity in that entity, and hence, you can get the tax deductibility of most of the interest, which also is quite positive. I don't
think we have spoken too much about that, but we can focus on it when we have (inaudible), also shed a little bit more color to say how much
more effective do we become if there's...
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thanks, Paul. There is a question just related to tax. Can we confirm that there are no material adverse tax consequences, given that you are selling
the 50% for well below what it cost? Question from Chris.

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Chris, yes, when we take the (inaudible), I think tax incentives were a significant part of the MPV of the product -- project. We feel comfortable that
all the tax credits that we've got until now, none of that will be full (inaudible). So ultimately, most of those tax benefits will still remain.

The other portion on tax, though, looking forward from now, going forward, if one then excludes tax expense, which is still very much coming to
Sasol, the forward-looking tax benefits were more in the -- in terms of lower profit and taxes, and that made the large share up of the tax benefits.
Those won't be coming (inaudible) between our portion as well as the demand of our portion. Ultimately, it needs (inaudible) from the Louisiana
governance tax, governance of (inaudible). We have submitted those applications already. We feel quite positive that there will not be any adverse
impact.

So we will obviously (inaudible) based on the kind of the disposal of our portion, but the lion's share will still be coming our way, and we'll still have
impact -- positive impact on our MPVs going forward. So there is no loss of previous tax losses either on our future -- sitting against our future
revenues. So our tax position is still very much protected as a result of this as well.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Paul. There is a question from Mark Thomas from Chemical Week. Is Sasol in any talks with other previously interested parties for other
performance assets, Performance Chemicals assets at Lake Charles? And is it possible to have a construct of other JVs in that instance?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Yes. Thank you for the question. I think we've been very clear from the outset, and it is underpinned by our strategy that we would see partnering
options for the Base Chemicals assets in Lake Charles. So our Performance Chemicals assets are core to our strategy, and we've got no need or
compelling reason, neither a strategic intent, to partner at this stage with any of our Performance Chemicals assets in Lake Charles. So the answer
is a definite no.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you. In terms of -- a question from Catherine Stronach from Columbia Threadneedle Investments. What is the time line you are targeting for
deleveraging to achieve an IG rating again?

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
I think that's also a very good question. So there is a few sides to this point, Catherine. The first one being is the methodology of your rating agencies.
So the rating agencies, because most of our income is still derived from South African mines and because we still domicile South Africa. The rating
agencies will allow you to decouple effectively from the South African sovereign only limited to certain levels. So you've got 5 levels for (inaudible).
But you can't be 5 levels higher than the sovereign in that methodology. So we also have to remember that in South Africa is at least more than 2
levels below investment grade. I think Sasol as a whole will find it difficult to be rated as investment-grade regardless. So that's the first thing.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I think the reason why I mentioned that is, we have been asked by our shareholders, will we drive investment-grade at all costs. And the answer is,
in this instance, you cannot like investment-grade at all cost because it doesn't make sense. But then, let's say, things with South African sovereign
is less than 2 levels below investment-grade, and your credit rating has improved to the point that it's sustainably incorrect that you can actually
improve below 2.5x net debt to EBITDA and that your forecast also indicates clearly in that direction. Obviously, there are many other factors that
the rating agencies do look at in terms of risk, governance and so on and so forth. But I can use a very key criteria for that one, then ultimately, the
rating agencies hopefully will technically consider our rating back to investment-grade. So those are really the 2 things.

So the third part of your question is how quick. So ultimately, if all goes well, we plan to be below 2.5x by 30th of June. And as the debt comes
down, the trajectory of letting EBITDA continuously improving, even in a $25 down the road with Sasol 2.0 assisting the vehicle. Then ultimately,
rating agencies will consider. I will say that we're probably the best of 18 to 24 months away from a re-rating back to investment-grade. I will say
best case, that will be my bet. But I can't answer for the rating agencies, I'm just giving you my view.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you, Paul. There is a question from [Tobela Biksa]. Could you please just clarify your time lines with regards to the new LCCP EBITDA guidance,
the LDPE reaching beneficial operation and the investor update conference?

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thanks, Feroza. So [Tobela], I think we've covered one already. So the beneficial operation of the LDPE is (inaudible) in October as we've covered
right at the outset. Our Investor Day, we are planning just after our Annual General Meeting. So that would be the first couple of days of December.
We will fix the date still, but it's probably just after the U.S. Thanksgiving, and the first time, we've got a solid business audience. So it's probably
the first days of December.

And then with respect to our outlook and EBITDA guidance, we would do that also latest at the time when we issue our business performance
metrics, which is then also later in October. So I think that would address in the various time lines. So the LDPE beneficial operation would be in
October, as we've indicated. So that's the target.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
Thank you. Then just in terms of the question we had about this -- sorry, will Sasol 2.0 cost savings influence your thinking around the rights issue,
which is a question from Adrian Hammond.

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
I think it's got to be quite critical. The thing is Sasol 2.0 will be focused on 1 type of cash flow generation. Can the company generate enough returns
on capital in an impoverished part of the world? I think we said that a couple of times. That cash flow generation is going towards (inaudible), and
it will also allow them to grow the company in terms of future disciplines and value distribution to shareholders. So for sure, that is definitely what
-- exactly my thinking, and that's exactly why we want to talk to you about that before we make a final decision on the rights issue to (inaudible).

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
All right. Thank you, Paul. There is a question from [Bekin Tetra]. It says, in terms of the employees that will transfer upon completion of the JV deal,
what is the approximate cost savings we can expect relative to the FY '19 cost base?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Thank you. Thank you, [Bekin]. We are not at this point in time in a position to give you that level of detail. We are still finalizing the carve-out, the
transfer of employees, the exact numbers and what is the approach to that. We will follow due communication and engagement with their
employees. So therefore, we're not in a position to share any of that detail today.

Feroza Syed - Sasol Limited - Chief IR Officer
All right. Maybe just the last question then that we have on the system is [Wade Napier]. What are your expectations for annual CapEx savings
following the disposal?

Paul Victor - Sasol Limited - CFO & Executive Director
Right. Very much so, we will ultimately work all of this out. During the Sasol 2.0 presentation to investors, our undertaking was to also provide you
with an update in terms of what our capital forecast will be for the next couple of years, meaning '21 -- financial '21 to '25. So ultimately, we were
also going to make it clear what asset disposals as a whole will work to our -- Sasol's capital layout going forward. So watch the space for that one.

Fleetwood Rawstorne Grobler - Sasol Limited - President, CEO & Executive Director
Okay. Feroza, I think we have dealt with the major and pressing questions that we received. So I think there are any residual questions that are still
coming through, please engage with our IR team. We would respond and deal with that, and we would continue to engage. So please feel free to
make use of that.

I do want to thank you for your attention and participation and questions this afternoon. And we look forward to give you more details as promised
in our next engagement around the circular and our business performance metrics that is due then in October and looking forward to engage with
you then again. So thank you very much for your attendance. Operator, we can conclude the call. Thank you very much.

PRESENTATION
Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend NTT IR Day today. I am Fujiki from NTT IR, and I will serve as the moderator
till the end of the meeting. Today, we will have presentation on 3 themes: technological strategy, global strategy and governance. And then move
on to the Q&A session by President Sawada at the end.

If you have questions or NTT DOCOMO subsidiary questions that we announced on September 29 will be entertained at the end. We plan to end
at 5:30 p.m.

Today, we have the live streaming by the Internet, and this will be distributed on demand at a later date. I hope you could understand.

Without further ado, the first theme, technical strategy, will be explained by Senior Executive Vice President, Shibutani, who will talk about NTT's
growth strategy from the viewpoint of the CTO. Mr. Shibutani, please.

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for the kind introduction. My name is Shibutani, the Senior Executive Vice President of NTT. I
was appointed in the current position back in June this year. Allow me to briefly introduce myself. I was involved in network reliability, building a
design -- for network reliability building back in Fukushima at 3.11. I was involved in the reconstruction and the rebuilding of the network after the
earthquake and tsunami.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Since then, I was involved in business development and also as the President of East Port, I was involved in exploration of new strategic business.
Now from June this year, I was appointed as the CTO, CIO and responsible for -- CTO responsible for digital transformation. So I'm responsible for
technology matters overall at NTT Holding company. I look forward to your kind support and understanding.

Now on the 19th -- on the 29th of this (sic) [last] month, we announced JPY 4 trillion worth of tender offer for NTT DOCOMO. I'm sure you're highly
interested in this particular topic. Back then, we had the largest market cap at NTT in the past. And also in the heyday of the IMO technology,
DOCOMO's market cap was around JPY 43 trillion. But then subsequently, the likes of GAFA and also BAT of China, these players have grown, and
there is now a major gap.

Can NTT once again be -- reemerge as an innovative company? That I am sure is the topic that you're most interested in.

With regard to the short-term growth plan, DOCOMO and other group operating companies will come up with rate plans and also will come up
with new services. And that is how we'll be responding to the requirements of the market. But in terms of the medium-term and beyond -- the
strategy for medium-term and beyond, it's important that R&D capacity of NTT Group and the technology capacity of NTT Group as a whole -- how
can we build this together so that we can drive innovation and contribute to the society? This is very important, and this is another matter of great
interest to the public.

So that being the case today, I would like to talk about NTT's growth strategy from the perspective of CTO. That is why I decided to choose this
topic. I would very much appreciate your kind attention until the very end. So let me start with the substance of my presentation.

On the 29th when we announced the tender offer, President and CEO Mr. Sawada mentioned that -- because of this tender offer, this is the direction
of business, which we're going to seek growth, and he identified 4 directions of growth. And the 2 boxes that are not covered in black, that's the
smart life and digital transformation.

In the case of digital transformation, JPY 800 billion cost reduction until 2023. And also with regard to smart life and B2B2X model business, by
2023, again, we are aiming for JPY 600 billion. These are the targets we have set for these 2 boxes. And we have made concrete progress to date.
But with the consolidation of the group December end, we'll be able to further expand these sites, and we'll be able to accelerate this growth.

Now in terms of the medium-term growth, the boxes that are covered in red, #1 and #3. Development and provision of new services space on a
remote world will be very critical. How can we provide that to the society at large? And the other box is #3. We want to make sure that we're able
to promote global scale R&D and drive innovation.

So for these 2 topics, I would like to primarily focus on during the presentation today. So in order to deliver these targets, and by the way, on the
29th, Mr. Sawada used these materials at the press conference, and we are going to pursue 4 pillars, and we are going to contribute to the society
at large.

In particular, I want to highlight the most relevant topics, the yellow one on the top, strengthening global industrial competitiveness. We want to
develop new services because the world becomes more virtual in nature. And it's important that we have the ability to deliver various services on
our own volition, so we want to bring about that change.

And the second, right now, 5G is being introduced, and we want to expand the area of coverage so that we'll be able to see the dawn of the new
IoT era. We really are in the new development stage. We're in the new era.

Mr. Sawada talked about 6G inclusive of space and outer space and underwater, it's important that the scope covered by wireless further expand
going forward. So inclusive of the deal of DOCOMO that we announced, it's important that we further accelerate the expansion of wireless.

And the third topic, this is in the blue part. We want to promote B2B2X. We want to support the society and enrich the society. So digitalization
and smartification and also revitalizing local communities and economies. These are the things that we need to promote.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So these would be the 3 targets, which I'll be covering today. And one further point that I wish to address. There's a common platform, the common
theme that runs across these 3 aforementioned targets, which is to -- increasing resilience and increasing cybersecurity. So increasing resilience
of information -- ICT system against disasters and strengthen the cybersecurity is the key as there's decoupling involving U.S. and China, it's important
that we offer trusted services.

There is a -- how do we deliver that in Japan because there's an increase in this topic on a global scale. So at the basis -- this is a common basis. So
inclusive of R&D, it's important that we address this very common theme that RAN core software is target. So let me talk about the 2 mention --
the 2 targets. How do we intend to pursue the growth? I want to focus on these 2 growth strategies and focus on how we intend to deliver them.
First is to develop and provide new services based on so-called remote world.

Let me try to explain the backdrop of what I mean. There's reference to local area network. This is the access network and the core is the upper
network, a 4-layer network. So RAN is the bottom layer. As you see, specific vendors provide vertical model, covering all the way from application,
hardware to software. And they're not providing that to carriers and end users. This is a very efficient model, by the way, and it is very integrated.
So therefore, it is efficient.

However, having said that, if you want to be innovative with regard to software, you have to -- you were reliant on vendors, so therefore this did
not drive very healthy innovation. What we want to pursue is a model on the right-hand side, which is the open model. This is what we would like
to pursue.

There are 2 approaches. First is the so-called multi-vendor approach, where various equipments could be selected, where you have a variety of
available options. This is the DUs -- CU, DU world. The other is where the upper layer equipment would be translated into the software, which
means that we, ourselves and our customers, will be able to expeditiously create their functions in a desired manner in an open environment.

This is what we would like to achieve as soon as possible. If this could be delivered, then, on the right-hand side, this actually is the fixed line network,
the telephone network offered by NTT, so it's an -- NTT FLET'S, which is the broadband fiber network. So NTT Comware and other operating
companies are trying to create a virtual situation.

If this is delivered, then full fledged fixed mobile convergence could be realized through software. Then to be more specific, so let me try to
summarize. So a dedicate -- so we want to make sure that we have a general-purpose open system so that we will be able to create a situation,
we'll be able to further advance the given environment.

So let me share with you some of the specific examples. On June 25, we announced that we'll be investing in NEC, and that initiative involves the
following: We are having a very heated discussion right now. And in 3 major phases, we're trying to consider the development going forward. In
order to pursue multi-vendor situation, it's important that RN -- RU and implements be connected through open network, open connection and
expand globally.

And the control units, the DU and CU, these control units, they should be driven by this virtual software and develop this new system, the new --
and then on top of that, what we would have is our strength, which is operation. And also flexibility and advance and reliability, these functions
or these features will be offered on top.

And we -- what we want to do is to deliver this to other vendors and to other carriers as well. So on the right-hand side, you'll find preference to
software and NEC with software technology, production technology, and also the ability to use them at DOCOMO and also NTT that has LSI and
both coming together can offer installation support and maintenance and operational services. We believe that we'll be able to expand our business
in this fashion.

Then that being the case, when this model is achieved, what type of universe are we going to welcome? This is the integration of mobile and fixed
line technologies for core networks. The left-hand side shows mobile network and fixed line network. These are 2 independent networks right
now. But with softwarization, based on virtual platform, we'll be able to integrate them.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So what are some of the challenges in the connected world? For example, in the case of Zoom, the telecommunication with your friends and also
when you have connection for mission-critical functions and also when you want connection with -- for government agencies, if you use SNS and
other meeting systems, the authentication and reliability issues are really going to be critical.

So by using the softwarization and platform, the authentication, security -- authentication and billing, security, XR, device management and
contents, we believe we'll be able to offer them because we have the advantage and know-how in these functions. And on top of that then, we'll
be able to offer trusted service.

That is the platform, which we want to deliver. In addition, it's important that on our own, we also have the ability to deliver new services. And also
it's important that with other partners, we provide trusted remote services through collaboration with those partners. So we believe that, that is
the services that we are offering in the context of remote world strategy, which is the first topic.

And the third pillar, which is the worldwide promotion of R&D. Let me explain about this particular topic. From -- about 2 years ago, our President,
Mr. Sawada, when he was appointed as the President, he talked about the Road to IOWN. The major pillars are as follows, but the primary pillars
are all-photonics network, #2; and also digital-twin computing, which is #3; and the cognitive foundation.

These are the major elements. Now this time around with DOCOMO becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary, then the wireless component, this was
not connected up until now, but this will not be connected with very strong connection. So therefore -- so wireless, all-photonics network, digital-twin
computing, all these functions will come together.

Then, that being the case, how can we leverage our strength in these different facets? I would like to talk about this one by one. So let me talk
about our strength in wireless. Right now, the 5G universe is expanded. But these are simply area coverage for smartphones on a landline -- on
land basis; 270,000 kilometers -- square kilometers in area.

In Japan, we have the exclusive economic zone. We have 2.45 million square kilometers, if you include the waters, such as the exclusive economic
zone. So we need IoT world that can cover not only land but also massive water space. And in order to achieve this, it means that we need to further
advance the current 5G technology or also pursue development in outer space and sky. It's important that we expand the coverage rather into
outer space and sky.

In the case of space, we have the pace of communication with satellite, needs to be further expanded by 10 unfold. And NTT has already verified
that. And also, we have partnered with JAXA and right now, we have various satellites, in 10s numbers, from space and creating constellation. And
we have initiatives where we will be able to offer communication to -- in this constellation fashion at 294 megahertz, which is the platinum
bandwidth.

We've used this platinum bandwidth and with very inexpensive terminals, we'll be able to have communication with space. We're trying to promote
that technology. So therefore, space level coverage, we hope that we'll be able to further promote going forward.

And also in terms of undersea, be it culture and also wind farm, it's important that we'll be able to monitor what is going on undersea as well as
above the sea. And so if you cannot reach the deep area, there is still many unknowns, but we have 300-meter class or mega class, the high-speed
sea acceleration technology. And therefore, we will combine this technology to have the true IoT wireless network that connects the land, ocean
and lead the world.

Now DOCOMO, the other day, announced 6G beyond 5G, and so extremely high data rate, capacity, extremely wide coverage, extremely low energy
and cost and low latency, high safety, reliability and this extremely massive connectivity. It will be covered from the outer space, and therefore,
multiple devices need to be connected at the same time to make this work.

So the speed and the simultaneous connectivity will be 10x more than 5G. And furthermore, we have to support the smart society. So the reliability
has to be 2 orders of magnitude higher. So TOB -- backed by DOB, the wireless DOCOMO and research institute can lead this technology. So we
can once again take on the challenge to lead the world. We have the core technology to do that.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Second point is all-photonics network, APN. It is a bit complex. So let me explain. Currently, in this diagram, the IP network at the bottom and PSTN
are the mainstream. IP network. Why this was so innovative was the DoD, Department of Defense -- even if one communication network is damaged,
it can still function. So put in IP packet network, send to the recipient and look at the pop and deliver to counter the attack. All the communication
data was integrated under this network.

And in the center -- plus it -- this is priority. This is highest priority, can be flagged. So voice, which was the biggest profit maker, was put into the
IP and send it real-time because it's high priority.

So right now, IP network integration is now underway. And so this was very innovative. But going forward, many traffic will be -- come on play. So
IP weakness is emerging. First of all, to do packeting, there is a delay. And you have to look at the routing. So there's routing delay latency. So this
has to be resolved. Otherwise, this red to blue, the smart mobility, smart city, health care, as the integrated network, it is still not enough. So
end-to-end optical network has to be established.

Then in mobility, multiple video need to be reflected to the transportation at low latency. And in health care, many people's health information,
even with smart delay, has to be archived. So this is a completely different requirement and we, in our network, have to provide that, to provide
digitalization and smartification. So that's the kind of communication that we have to realize.

So with this optical network, what is our strength? LSI. In the optical communication, we have led the world. Fiber is not dependent on coding.
And with Internet, global crossing, when the white -- broadband increased, we led the world to increase the wavelength. This time, we have to go
beyond the limit of more and go into the miniaturized world of the opticals to reduce the power consumption and have enough capacity.

NTT is leading the world there. More specifically, it is the integration of photonics and electronics. This strategy is our technological development
that we lead the world. And the component level chip 400 gigahertz transmission equipment is already in the commercialized stage, and we can
offer this by next year.

Next is chips and inside chips, we will incorporate optics to chips. The latency that converts to electricity or the power consumption converting to
electricity can be reduced. And Intel and NVIDIA are now coming on board.

Processor, we are starting from the communication device. The computer processor or GPU server, these can be integrated in photonics and
electronics for higher efficiency. So the top -- we are leading this research among the top players in the world.

And the third component, this is the digital-twin computing. This is the world of computer. This shows digital-twin computing. The real-world is
created in the virtual world and conduct simulation to forecast the future or manage the health or enhance efficiency to digitalize society.

So left side is the personal level and the right side is the national level or town, city level and globe. And the AI, data science efforts, for example,
in the smart city, we are doing this in Las Vegas or Uber City with Toyota and smart agri and smart chain with Mitsubishi Corporation. We are taking
on many challenges.

So we are honing these use cases. And this is a world of competition now. And other than that, we have other strengths, too. And that's what I
want to touch upon today. Two points. One is for the digital platform. In the digital era, this is a must. Digital map is a must, and we are running at
the forefront.

And another is health care. Digital data, when we collect medical digital data, it is precise -- you need a precise dedicated sensor. So the optical
and audio technology is something we have. So the device technology is what we are trying to promote.

So the first digital twin for the digital platform. For example, Zenrin or HIA, the overseas player, we formed alliance -- capital alliance. Google Maps
and others, there are many semantic information, where houses are, where are stores and what transportation network exists where? But that
alone is not enough in the digital era because the precision is low.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Zenrin Map is by meter -- it's deviating by meter. But if the person is walking, if using for a walk, it's okay. But for autonomous driving or for the
infrastructure development to dig underground, then it has to be -- the error can only be 10 centimeters at most. Otherwise, it's not functional in
4D, the vertical and horizontal and depth. The vertical and height, you have to have the map of the height and depth. Otherwise -- Kubota and the
heavy machinery manufacturers, you need to have digital instruction to show the height and the depth underground. That's 3D.

In addition, time line. With time line, you can see the deterioration, comparing with past data, the health or the geographic data or how environment
is changing, you can see all that. So 4D data digital platform is now used -- advanced geographic space information database. And the right side
is the business use case. So the navigation, high-precision location navigation and the smartification in industry and the city design, we are trying
to apply in these areas.

Next is digital-twin device. Various cases here and some are commercialized. Wearable electrocardiogram with Toray, our sensor is embedded in
fiber to always take the electrocardiogram vital data. And other than that, the temperature inside the body and with AI stethoscope, we can have
-- even if you're not an expert, you can take the pulse very accurately or implant -- sensors embedded in implant and on digital twin it can be
reproduced.

So by combining with your heart, we can use this technology. So this optical technology, we are leading the world. Terumo and other manufacturers
will be making the products, but we have the core technology. So that is what we are thinking and pursuing our core technology that we excel at.

One more new area. So wireless and fixed line and computer are integrated in this world, but we think this will be disaggregated. What I mean by
that is the computer power, the left side, the red one, currently, the network, Amazon and Microsoft Cloud, it's accumulated there and processed
there. But in terms of collection, it is efficient, but it uses much power and the collected data needs to be converted to electricity again to analyze.

So the process speed and -- it is not efficient. So network and computing need to be modularized. Some will be down permits, some will be in
users, some will be core network, or Amazon Cloud. So it will be distributed. As you see at the top, the computing that can support the society will
be required. It says OS. So we want to optimize this in totality. The operational scheme in software innovation research lab is now addressing this
challenge. And this discussion is now just starting in the world. So we want to lead this endeavor.

So my time is almost up. I talked about NTT's medium-term strategy, promoting with technology, and I talked about many new developments, the
use cases or the progress. November 17 to November 20, we will have an R&D forum online. So President Sawada and Research Lab Center Head
Kawazoe-san will do a presentation like we did today in more detail or show you some actual examples so that you can directly experience. So I
hope you could enter and attend.

That concludes my presentation. This -- including the large-scale deal, we want to support the society and help realize the digital society from
technology. We want to lead the technology. So I ask you for your continuous expectation. Thank you very much.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
The first question is from SMBC Nikko Securities, Mr. Kikuchi.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
My name is Kikuchi. I was able to identify very interesting topics. And I would like to very much study about these topics going forward. If I may
ask a question, sir, about R&D organization? Within the group, the operating companies have different research and development organizations.
Now there's been a major shift in the transformation through this deal. I would image that, that is going to be the case, possibly.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I know that the specifics of what you're going to do are not determined yet, but with regard to how -- if you could share with us the policy with
regard to the structure of your R&D going forward?

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Thank you for that question. As explained in the course of my presentation earlier, as, Mr. Kikuchi, you mentioned, the role of R&D will become
even more important down the road. At the same time, we're going to have a tender offer for DOCOMO. We want to make sure that we're fully
connected to the IOWN because we had a part which was not yet connected.

So -- because wireless is going to be so critical, it's important that this component to be part of the IOWN concept. So this is the top priority for us.
So with regard to reorganization, of course, it's a matter of what type of organization we're going to create. But this wireless part, the holding
companies, R&D will talk about outer space and also undersea, Wi-Fi, they're very strong.

But in the case of DOCOMO, they have strength in 5G and also strength in the 6G, which will follow, so -- whether we converge these 2 so that in
the wireless area, we'll be able to accelerate R&D. So without a doubt, that will be the top priority for us.

And one other point with regard to R&D itself, with open innovation, we need to involve various global parties. So therefore, it's important that we
accelerate our global activities. And for that purpose, we need to create such a team. So we're going to focus on this global oriented team even
more as we go down -- as we go further ahead.

So it's important that the emphasis of R&D before we strengthen in the management. That is all. Thank you very much. That is all.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
I know that there are a lot of study groups and tours that you're carrying out in various parts of your group, and you are very highly motivated. So
I'm not sure whether or not if this is included, but I hope that with NTT data as well, I hope that you'll be able to do something that -- which can
translate into concrete output.

It's important that you provide some economic analysis so that we will be able to have a dialogue with you. I would appreciate some sort of
explanation about how you intent to advance your organization going forward?

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Yes. Thank you. Thank you for your encouragement. We will certainly do our best. Thank you for all those comments.

Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
Next question is Nomura Securities, Masuno-san. Mr. Masuno, please.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
I have 2 questions. First, as you mentioned at the outset, network virtualization, CU and DU virtualization. vRAN, Altiostar is already realizing this.
So what is the difference and the future progress? How do you see the future progress? And you will do this in parallel with O-RAN? So that's my
first question.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Thank you. As you correctly mentioned Rakuten and (inaudible), they are already -- vRAN with Altiostar is already being commercialized. But
difference with Rakuten is the ones that can build with zero base are introducing vRAN and other global carriers, including Rakuten have the existing
network and migrating to virtualization. So that's the challenge they have to overcome.

So we want to build the virtualization that can meet those needs. Altiostar, we will consult with them initially to move forward. However, as I
mentioned in this material, what we are trying to pursue is NEC, the O-RAN, CU, DU, not just the virtualization there, but furthermore, core network,
white box and software. We are trying to go that far. And our R&D team will be involved and with Intel -- working with Intel and other players.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
My second question is about the semiconductor, optical semiconductor. In terms of IR, this is ESG, social contribution and the power consumption
may be reduced by 100th. After this spring, Intel, Microsoft were invited and a few dozen companies came up with the standard and moving
towards the commercialization -- taking steps towards commercialization. From R&D, this is an aggressive short-term target, but the commercialization
is targeted in 5 years' time. So the current progress, the current status and the outlook, if you could update us once again?

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Thank you. So what is mentioned here, 400-giga transceiver on the silicon, the optical will be included and power consumption version can be
launched next year. And the next one, interposer in chips -- electrical circuit in chip will be done optically. So chip-to-chip connection will be optical.
And then package will be made to optical. And in the end, we will build chips optically.

But in the meantime, in the next 2 to 3 years, optical interposer device can be realized. So we will go in phases. And in the end, the optical and
electric will be integrated. So this photonic-electric convergence will be released as soon as possible.

So the global standard is already underway. IOWN Global Forum, NVIDIA is now involved, Intel, NVIDIA are now part of us. So open innovation,
standardization will be pursued. And co-innovation, collaboration will also be established. So various strategies will be utilized as we move forward.

Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
Thank you, very much. Masuno-san, I am afraid because of the time constraint, this will be the final question. So this will be the last question of the
session. Next question is from Citigroup Securities, Mr. Tsuruo.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
I hope you can hear my voice. Two questions. My first question relates to Masuno-san's previous question about O-RAN. You mentioned that some
would start from pure, some will start from brownfield. So very briefly, what are the advantages and disadvantages of these 2 approaches, starting
the pure approach and the brownfield approach? And that being the case, how does NTT intend to offset any negatives that could be suffered by
the companies who follow the brownfield approach?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Well, in terms of virtualization, the packet core -- the core -- the packet core virtualization is something that DOCOMO has already begun to launch
significantly. So as a replacement, virtualization can be introduced in certain parts. So EOL timing. In other words, once the equipment needs to
be replaced, then we can -- we will be able to replace that. So already, in some parts, this is being done.

On the other hand, in the case of CDR with RDU, as I mentioned earlier, there's interoperability between these components need to be considered.
They have to be insured. So this is the area where, regardless of any combination, you have to connect to vRAN, virtual RAN -- oh, sorry, it's not yet
done. This is one that we have a position where everything can be connected to vRAN. So making sure that we ensure connectivity of existing
systems with vRAN and then pursue replacement. That type of approach needs to be pursued.

Also, right now, 5G is expanding. In the case of growth communities, we can use the greenfield approach. So in those approaches, we can actually
deliver and introduce a launch of virtual from the beginning. So it's important that we have a good combination between the existing system,
reduce the CapEx and at the same time make sure that we leverage the strength of the virtual platform.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
If I could ask a follow-up question? When you make this coordination, do you believe that you'll be able to overcome the gap with companies that
are able to follow the greenfield approach?

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Well, as you point out, what is the pricing? What can we deliver? That's something that we need to scrutinize further.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
Thank you. My second question. I'd like to go back to the partnership. I know that -- what is the competing technology vis-à-vis IOWN in relation
to 6G? And so that being the case, in order to have a de facto victory, what are some of the focus -- emphasis that you need to focus on? Of course,
partnership is important. But what is the emphasis that you're bearing in mind when -- as you try to grade 6G de facto standard?

Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
You're talking about competition between 6G and IOWN? Is that what you asked?

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
No, no, no. That's not the case. I think in the case of optical semiconductor, this is very important to drive 6G technologies. Is my understanding
correct? If that is the case, then is there a standard technology that can compete with -- in the context of 6G? And also, if you want to compete with
such technology, what must be done? I guess, that is gist of my question.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Naoki Shibutani - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CTO,Chief Information Officer, Chief Digital Officer & Representative
Director
Well, yes. Perhaps my explanation was not sufficient. In the case of 6G, we are trying to expand the wireless technology, wireless universe. In the
case -- the main target for the photonic-electronic convergence is to create all-photonics network. We want to apply the all-photonics technology.
So it is not a direct competition between the two.

But the wireless world, it also need to incorporate digital signaling processor, they need more advanced signaling processor. So that being the
case, so photonics and electronics convergence could be applied in that particular area as well.

Now in terms of any competing technology, well, how far can the nonphotonic-electronic convergence world advance? I guess that is a going to
be the dictating factor. Well, we can't say about collaboration, but Intel and NVIDIA might decide to further brush up their executive technology.
So the cost competition is going to be the key how advantageous can photonics and electronic convergence be? But these 2 companies are now
part of the IOWN partnership. That is because we believe that they want a new perspective.

They want to be involved in this new LSI development. Unless they're involved in this development, then they will not be able to overcome whatever
boundaries or obstacles that may exist. So that being the case, I do hope that they will further be involved as partners in this initiative.

Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
Thank you very much, Mr. Tsuruo. So with that, we will close the Q&A session. Thank you very much, Mr. Shibutani.
PRESENTATION
Natsuko Fujiki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Head of IR, Finance & Accounting Department
Next, second theme. Global strategy. Global Business Promotion Office, Mr. Ozaki, and Mr. Nakayama, Senior Vice President and Head of Finance
and Accounting, will do a presentation. Mr. Ozaki has been involved in the global business all along, and 3 years from 2016 was in Hong Kong, NTT
Com Asia President, a local subsidiary. The overseas data center launch and enhancement had been its business. He has been -- led the global
business of NTT.

And in July this year, he became global business promotion office head. Today, he will talk about the overseas company NTT Limited that was
launched last year, the progress of the business reform and the future business strategy.

Nakayama, Senior Vice President of Head of Finance and Accounting, will ask questions, and Mr. Ozaki will respond to that. It will be a Q&A session.
So Mr. Ozaki and Mr. Nakayama, please.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Kazuhiko Nakayama - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Finance and Accounting
Thank you very much. My name is Nakayama. I'm the Head of Finance and Accounting. As was introduced by the moderator, I would like to pose
questions that are heard from investors on a day-to-day basis. And based on that interest of the investors, I would like to ask questions to Mr. Ozaki,
who is the Senior Vice President and Head of Global Business in this dialogue.

And also we have set aside our time to answer questions directly from the investors, so we hope that you will take part in the Q&A session as well.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So without further ado, let's start the session. So Mr. Ozaki, first of all, NTT's global business reorganization was carried out in July last year, starting
in July, and NTT Limited was established anew in July of 2019. So can you talk about the activities of the past year at NTT Limited, if you could share
that with us? Thank you.

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes, thank you very much. Thank you very much. I was appointed as the Head of Global Business since July this year. My name is Ozaki. I really
appreciate this opportunity. So as you are aware, in July of last year, NTT Limited was established.

NTT Limited combines NTT Communications, Dimension Data and NTT Security. 150 companies have gone together to create NTT Limited. And
in each of these 3 companies, they were -- we had presidents, we also had employees for Dimension Data, NTT Communications and NTT Security.
So it's an aggregation of very large number of people and companies. So that being the case, it's important that our line of vision are totally aligned
among the total employee base.

So we wanted to prioritize the expansion of profit, not scale. And the second is that we shift to value-added services that are more profitable in
nature and deliver value to our customers. So focus on value-added services and shifting to value-added services.

And the final point was that we implement structural reform by the end of the year. That's what we try to keep in mind. Now last fiscal year, we
launched the structural reform, and we were able to implement structural reform. So in terms of the most recent financial situation, because of the
-- those structural reform, last fiscal year, we had very large deficit. But now the structural reform benefits are now beginning to be seen. So therefore,
I believe the company is back on track to drive profit.

Now this fiscal year, we believe that -- correction, we have a target of JPY 5 billion as a profit, and we're making efforts as a team to achieve this.
The progress up until August has been very robust so far. But then because of COVID-19, the greatest risk is that our sense of urgency become lax.
So therefore, it's important that we do not -- that we become -- it's important that we not become lax and that we further accelerate reform.

Next, let me talk about the percentage of the value-added services. This -- if the company is to become further profitable and if the company is to
drive profit in a stable fashion, it's important that we increase the percentage of profit of business. And we have a situation where we have a
structure where we can continuously drive value -- profits from value-added services.

Let's just go through. 32% of sales was the percentage, but this was in the COVID-19 universe, value-added services are actually increasing. 36%
of sales will be achieved. And by 2023, we hope that the 50% of our sales could be driven by value-added services. So that is the reform and
improvements, which we're trying to drive as we speak.

Now in terms of examples of value-added services, let me try to explain what they are. This is an example from North America. In North America,
usage of cloud is by far most expeditious compared to other regions. And these customers -- their mission-critical services are shifting from their
customer premise to cloud in a safe environment. There is a demand that customers be able to migrate their mission-critical servers from on-premise
to cloud, which means that they have high-performance environment. And that's just North America. So as far as Europe and Asia included, they
want to pursue IT reform. And that type of demand is quite prevalent.

So that being the case, in the case of North America, we have private cloud services being used. In case of Europe, we have data centers. In Asia,
Microsoft public cloud, that was being utilized by customers. So we are accommodating multi-cloud environment and offering managed services.
So that is the type of proposal, which we provided to this particular case. And the customers ended up choosing our service at the end of the day.

So by reflecting value-added services, we were able to resolve customers' issues. And we came up -- we were able to come up with an IT plan
together with our customers, bearing in mind those elements.

Next, from March through July this year, we had spread of COVID-19 on global scale. At NTT Ltd., we offered NTT a safe remote work environment.
And more than 500,000 remote office environments were developed and also -- we also offered security environment for the customers. So we've

                                                                                                                                                                             
 made -- so we were involved in this reset work also. As is the case with the program today, it's very difficult to have face-to-face event. So digital
event services is now being proposed to many of the customers.

Now from this point onwards, if NTT Ltd. is to further drive profitability, what is required? There are 2 elements. First is sales transformation. And
the other is improved productivity -- business productivity.

So let me talk about improving global operation efficiency. This activity has already been launched. In the case of shared service center, this is a
consolidation center for various operations. In April this year, we decided to establish 2 such centers. One is in Romania. The other is in Malaysia.

And here, operational support services and also personnel and accounting services were consolidated. And we innovated the IT system and
improved cost efficiency. And we are expecting JPY 50 million cost reduction from fiscal 2020 to fiscal '23, that is our expectation.

And what about sales transformation? But -- this is something that reviews go-to-market service and go-to-market strategy. So the customers will
be more incentivized to use our system. Already 1,700 customers are there. And we decided to categorize, resegment these customers. And digital
transformation and the modernization of all these companies will be coupled with our value-added services. And we wanted to put proposals to
these companies.

So that being the case, we decided to recreate the sales system based on this new categorization. So based on One NTT concept, from October
this year, we'll be further accelerating our sales effort based on One NTT strategy.

So sales transformation and go-to-market reflecting such services and shifting to value-added services. And also cost efficiency improvements by
using shared service center and improving our cost efficiency. With this, we believe that this fiscal year, as things stand right now, our operating
margin is 2.6%, approximately $300 million. That's our profit. But we want to improve this to $1 million (sic) [$1 billion] and operating margin of
7%. That is our goal. That is all. Thank you very much.

Kazuhiko Nakayama - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Finance and Accounting
Thank you. So allow me now to ask a few questions to Mr. Ozaki. So Ozaki, rather.

My first question the impact of COVID-19, that is what I would like to ask. Fiscal year 2020, the guidance for fiscal 2020 for overseas sales is JPY 120
billion impact. And also in terms of operating income, JPY 25 billion negative impact is being foreseen. That number has been disclosed.

What is the current situation with regard to such negative impact?

And also, I would assume that this might be a difficult question for you to respond to depending on decision -- on how the situation evolves, but
after next fiscal year, what is going to be the likely situation? Can you try to envision what is going to be the situation over the next fiscal year?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
So the impact of COVID-19 for this fiscal year, in the first quarter, the impact in terms of sales at NTT Ltd. was JPY 16 billion impact. On a full year
basis, we believe that close to JPY 80 billion impact is likely to be there for sales on a full year basis. That is the current plan that we have on a
monthly basis, we cautiously monitor the situation. At NTT Ltd., we've established this plan, and we believe that the situation is very much in line
with the plan, which we have established.

So the impact on sales right now up until the month of August is roughly very much in line with our projection. So 8% in terms of the percentage
-- in terms of the impact on sales is seen, especially in Asia. We are beginning to see significant impact in sales in Asia.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Now turning to NTT DATA. Right now, the financial impact of COVID-19 is not yet prevalent. But primarily based on North America, the order taking
is beginning to slow down. So going forward, there could be potential impact. So we are cautiously monitoring the situation.

Kazuhiko Nakayama - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Finance and Accounting
So second question, the investors' biggest interest is the international global business. So the medium-term strategy, what is your financial target
in fiscal year 2023, USD 25 million, USD 1 billion and 7% operating profit margin?

On the last page, you talked about limited activities, the image of the activities. So if you could quantify this 2.6% in 3 years' time will go up to 7%.
If you could quantify this a little more, please?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
This year, JPY 300 million is the profit target and fiscal year '23 is USD 1 billion. So it's a challenging goal, but we will take measures 1 by 1 and
accumulate lock 1 by 1. And with that, we think we can achieve this target.

As I mentioned earlier, sales transformation will be driven from October around the world. And this activity, from my experience from the frontline,
will take a little time because the customers' IT challenges needs to be heard carefully, understood and planned and budget need to be secured
and have our services used. It takes time for our service to be installed. So the activities that we've taken so far will become orders in 1 year time.
And in fiscal year 2022 or '23, it will have a positive impact on our financial results. I think that's the kind of time line.

So the key here is, in the meantime, from now to fiscal year '21, we need to take measures of the business process optimization expeditiously. And
by reducing cost, we can have competitive price and if the customers can choose us, then it will lead to profit. So this is something we have to do.
By having 2 wheels of a car, 7% can be achieved in fiscal year 2023.

Kazuhiko Nakayama - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Finance and Accounting
Thank you. So in your explanation, you talked about the sales on the offense side, how the high value-added service can be grown. This is important.
I understand.

So in your presentation, you talked about the high added value service, ratio of total sales. The graph, if you could first project that slide. So in IR
Day last year, NTT Ltd., Jason Goodall, CEO, talked about 50% in fiscal year 2023. We are frequently asked by the investors that so the 50% high
added value services, data center, managed service ratio or the breakdown. So we are asked to give the breakdown -- rough breakdown. So could
you enlighten us on that?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Data center 30%, managed service 30%, network 20% and cloud communications business voice service is the remainder.

Kazuhiko Nakayama - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Finance and Accounting
Understood. So data center 30%, managed services 30%. So those 2 account for a large portion. So 1 additional question. Data center, managed
services, market size, how do you think the market will evolve? Will this grow strongly? And as the player in the market, what do you think is NTT's
competitive edge differentiation that allows us to capture market share vis-à-vis the competitors? What do you think our strength?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes, the market size, the global market size is JPY 40 trillion. And especially the cloud type managed services is now growing strongly. The growth
is around 20%, JPY 8.5 trillion, 20%. Data center market size is around JPY 13 trillion. Growth is 10%.

Now our current status is, in managed services, North America is strong. On a year-on-year basis, 30% growth, although the sales is still small. Data
center is now also growing at 15%. So this is where we stand at.

And our strength, as mentioned here, we have global network and data center and cloud service platform that can allow us to offer managed
service. So the global capability and another strength is our relationship with our customers. Customer intimacy we can provide good service,
backed by good technology and automation. And that allows us to generate profit. So that model is our strength.

The first question is from Nomura Securities, Masuno-san.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
Two questions. My first question is about the data center. You talked about the strength. You mentioned the strength for the NTT group overall.
But with regard to data centers, if the migration to the cloud is accelerating and in the post COVID-19 universe, I believe that this will continue to
project very strong growth. But in terms of comparison with your competition, what is your strength? I know that there are variances and differences
from region to region. But in terms of Digital Reality, Equinix, what is the difference between your competition? That's my first question.

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes. Thank you. Well, DRT, Equinix competition. First a comparison between our competition such as DRT and Equinix. As I mentioned earlier,
network cloud, data center included, NTT has the capacity to provide total comprehensive services. So in the facilities that we deliver, we're able
to provide very robust management and deliver that to our customers. We believe that represents our strength.

And the customers' demands and requirements are changing. For example, back in 2016, when I was in Hong Kong, until [2009]. This was at a time
when customers were beginning to explore the possibility of cloud in Asia. And at that time, we had data centers and cloud and migration, and
we're trying to drive migration to cloud. And we provide a very meticulous technical support to our customers, and we're able to support customers'
migration to cloud. We actually offered the implementation of cloud as well. So this is something that we really cared about, and we emphasized.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
Well, in the case of North America, I think you have -- you'll begin to see increasing capacity for hyperscalers. You talked about JPY 100 billion data
center CapEx. You mentioned that you're going to continue this caliber of CapEx for data centers outside Japan. How sustainable is this investment?

And also, as NTT and DOCOMO work together. I know that there are possible talks about selling some of the assets and incorporating REITs. What
about the possibility of taking off-balance some of those assets going forward?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Well, first of all, with regard to the investment, the requirements of the hyperscalers continue to be very robust. So up until 2023, we believe that
this will continue to a certain degree. At the same time, though, it's important that we become an asset-light operation that we have that very
strong mission. So taking assets off-balance, that is something that we're pursuing in parallel as well.

Next question is from SMBC Nikko Securities, Mr. Kikuchi.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Kikuchi speaking here. My question overlapped with Masuno-san. It was about the expansion of the scale of the data center, but it was answered,
so I'm fine.

Operator
Next question is from SBI Securities, Mr. Moriyuki, please.

Shinji Moriyuki - SBI Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division - Analyst
Can you hear me?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes.

Shinji Moriyuki - SBI Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division - Analyst
So earlier, you talked about your strength, managed services. What do you think your weaknesses are vis-à-vis your competitors? And in what time
frame -- how do you plan to resolve those weaknesses?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes. Private cloud service is our core to deal with the cloud, migration to cloud. Our customers some have needs to migrate to public cloud. So in
case of migration to public cloud, our customer support and the various automated, performance monitoring and patch for security problems.
These are routine tasks, but customers, as managed service, we do these businesses for them.

And our cloud service is making profit automating this at high efficiency. But once there's a migration to public cloud, we cannot do all these
services for them. But it's a market trend. So public cloud, cloud security strengths will be explained. We will explain our strength in private cloud
and support the public cloud, too. We can support to a certain extent. So that is what we will do in the sales activities.

Shinji Moriyuki - SBI Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division - Analyst
So any initiatives on the public cloud side? You will continue what you are doing now after migrating to public cloud? Or are you going to take any
particular actions in public side?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
We announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft the other day, our strategic partner, Microsoft Azure service will be offered to those who watch
public cloud. That's our policy. And managed service can be provided in that opportunity.

Shinji Moriyuki - SBI Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division - Analyst
And you will expand that going forward?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Yes. This strategic alliance, go-to-market service development, it covers wide range of areas. So we will drive this forward.

Operator
I'm afraid in the interest of time, this will be the final question of this session. Next question is from Daiwa Securities, Mr. Ando.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
I wanted to ask a qualitative question. I would like to ask about your feeling as of actual management of NTT Ltd. Let me first ask a question about
the organization. I know -- are you going to revisit your reporting line going forward? Have you already completed the restructuring of our reporting
line? That's my first question.

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Well, last fiscal year, this organization was established. And the head office was located in London, and the management team has been active
since July of 2019. In principle, based on that management team, we are pursuing our business and operations. For example, depending on regions,
starting from yesterday, actually, in the case of Asia -- APAC and Australia was integrated into 1 region, very close as a region. And the requirements
of the customers are very close.

So depending on the situation, the organization will be revisited. But the basic policy will follow this situation with separate set of languages, which
is having head office in London and having hub offices in other regions. That principal structure remains unchanged.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
It seems -- is it correct to understand that the reporting line follows a well -- very well entrenched top-down system?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
Well, let's say that with regard to integration policy and the intentions of the management team from the head office to be projected to the various
regional sites, that needs to be important. But yes, it has to be directional and support that we get, we'll be able to get feedback from the people
on the ground.

So that is very important in terms of the governance structure. And compared with the time that we launched the system last year, I think that
situation has really significantly improved.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
My second question. Especially in North America, we see a market that is very dynamic and very rapidly changing. If you could just share with us
your impression. You mentioned that value-added services accounted for 50% of the sales going forward. But I guess my question is, as you try to
migrate to this platform, if there is -- if you are making progress, do you believe that you are in a position where you're able to reach your targets
ahead of your competition? Or do you believe that the targets you offset is simply in line with the prevailing situation?

Hideaki Ozaki - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior VP & Head of Global Business
In the case of North America, we have companies that operate data centers. We have managed service operating company. We also have a network
company as well. And we have the head office, and we have very robust sales team there.

Up until now, in the contest of NTT Ltd., we would provide proposals to the customers. And we are now beginning to receive orders for value-added
service projects, inclusive of value-added services and data centers. So we believe that going forward, together with our sales force at NTT DATA,
NTT Ltd. will be able to propose value-added services to NTT DATA's customers. So we want to accelerate One NTT team activities going forward.
So I hope that you look forward to the results.

It might take a bit of time. But if we start now, we believe that by next fiscal year, we will be in a situation where we're able to provide proposals,
very positive proposals that also reflects value-added services. And that will lead to new orders taking, and we hope that this will further bring
positive results in '22 and 2023. That is my expectation. And that, I believe, is the expectation on the part of NTT Holding Company, and we want
to make sure that we drive this.

Operator
With that, we will end the Q&A session. After this, we will have a Q&A session, so please ask more questions there.

Mr. Ozaki, Mr. Nakayama, thank you very much. Thank you very much for your attention.
PRESENTATION
Unidentified Company Representative
Next topic will be at NTT's governance reform. Senior Executive Vice President, Mr. Shimada; and Independent Director, Mr. Sakakibara, will be
joining us on stage, and we will have a dialogue style presentation format.

Mr. Sakakibara, served as the President and Chairman of Toray Industries. And for 4 years after 2014, he served as the Chairman of Keidanren, Japan
Business Federation, and he was relied -- he was involved in the delivery of Japan Society 5.0. He developed to -- he contributed the development
of Japanese economy. Ever since he was appointed as the Independent Outside Director of our company in 2012, over the past 8 years, he has
provided very constructive and very candid valuable advice from a very objective position.

Today, he will talk about -- he will share with us his thoughts about the situation of NTT's efforts to reform governance. And also he will share with
us what his thoughts are. So we're looking forward to a very wide-ranging dialogue.

I'd now like to invite Mr. Shimada, Senior Executive Vice President; and Outside Director, Mr. Sakakibara to the stage.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
Thank you very much. In this session, we would like to focus on NTT's governance reform.

When we take a look at the history of Japanese corporate sectors governance, how has NTT addressed corporate governance along the way. As it
was mentioned earlier, Mr. Sakakibara has been our Independent Outside Director for Keidanren, and we have invited him to the stage as our guest.
So without further ado, shall we start our session.

So how was the corporate governance code introduced in Japan? In 2012, our administration was formed, and it's one of the third arrow of
Abenomics. The government was trying to drive private sector investment. And therefore, in 2013, Japan revitalization strategy was formed. And
1 year later, in order to further fortify this policy, strengthening of corporate governance was actually positioned as per the Japan's growth strategy,
and this was incorporated into Japan's -- Japan revitalization strategy.

And at around at the same time, at a study group under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, or METI, the investors and companies -- it
was pointed out that corporate -- enterprise value being incorporated and enhanced through further dialogue with the investors in the private
sector. The so-called Ito report, Ito Review was announced. And this report recommended that ROE target should be set at 8%. I know that the
Investors community had positive view of Ito Review. Many investors at that time pointed out that they very much like to see the Japanese companies
deliver 8% ROE.

Now in 2015, in a very speedy fashion, the corporate governance code was introduced. And this -- the task was under the Financial Service Agency
and TSE, Tokyo Stock Exchange, together created this corporate governance. So that's how corporate governance code was established in Japan.
Now this was at a time when Mr. Sakakibara was leading Keidanren as the Chairman.

So can you talk about how the business sector addressed the corporate governance question.

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
As you pointed out, under the second session -- question, in December of 2012, the second Abe government was formed. And revival of the
Japanese economy was the top foremost priority for this administration. And at the same time, under the cabinet office, industrial competitiveness
task force was also established. And Prime Minister Abe himself chaired this session, and relevant ministers and also several representatives from
the private sector took part. I also took part in the Industrial Competitiveness Council as the representative of the private sector, and we discussed
this growth strategy.

And the issue presented by the industrial community -- by business community back in 2013 was that the competitiveness of Japan was being
undermined by 6 factors. There are 6 factors that are actually undermined the growth of the Japanese economy, and that needs to be resolved.
First was the strong yen. It was JPY 80 to the dollar, so we need to resolve the strong yen. And also, the corporate tax was already at 35%, the highest
in the world at the background.

And also, EPA, Economic Partnership Agreement, compared to neighboring countries such as Republic of Korea, we have very few installed energy
cost and environmental regulation issues and also labor code issue. So we outlined 6 challenges that need to be resolved in order for the Japanese
competitiveness to be enhanced. That was the view from the business community in Japan.

At the same time, we wanted to ensure growth by securing competitiveness. At the same time, it was important that we need to be more profitable
as business community. And members of the academia pointed out that in the case of companies in Europe and the United States, ROE was around
10% to 15%. But the Japanese company's average ROE back then was 5%. Why there is wider gap?

The analyst reasoned, the corporate governance was the key. In the case of companies in U.S. and Europe, their perspective was based on interest
of the investors. And outside directors were very much involved in this decision related to management strategy of the companies, in particular,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 growth strategy, portfolio review and productivity improvement. They had very lovely debate among the management and the investors. And
that led to the company's ability to drive profitability. In order to realize revitalization to Japanese economy, corporate governance was indispensable.

So therefore, one of the outputs of this industrial competitiveness task force was indeed this corporate governance-related recommendation. As
a result, in 2016, the Japan revitalization strategy came out with this new policy. And as the head -- I was the Chairman of Keidanren at the time,
corporate governance code literally came into being. So it's not how much the government showed the way. The government and the private
sector together created this code. So therefore, the industrial community was very much involved. Unless they pursue this code, they cannot secure
the growth of the industry. So that's how this code was established.

Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
At the time of the corporate governance code, I was responsible for this issue within my company. And within a very relatively short period of time,
it was spring that TSE announced this and already in summer of this year, it was implemented. So this was unprecedentedly very high-speed
implementation in Japan.

So the members of the Keidanren, how did they react to this?

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
Well, I was the President of Keidanren and to the member companies, I try to play to the importance of the corporate governance reform. As you
pointed out, it was very speedy. Within a very short period of time, we had to come up with a concrete plan. So there was a sense of -- of course,
many in the business community in Japan were perplexed.

And also, back in 2014, there are a lot of different forms of corporate governance, Japanese, European, American way. And many Japanese companies
felt that there was a Japanese way.

And one other point was that because of independent outside director and the significance of having outside independent director, how could
independent outside director who was someone first in the management of the company will be -- contribute to the decision related to management
policy? Many Japanese executives questioned the ability of such independent outside directors, that's along with the case.

So therefore, introduction of outside directors initially was not done in a very smooth fashion. However, via the corporate governance code and
concrete numerical targets were set. So as a result, in a short period of time, introduction of outside directors were implemented. So we have a
bump of -- in 2015, back then, companies with more than 2 outside directors was only 20% among the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.

Now in 2020, 96% of the companies already have more than 2 outside directors on board. And also, 60% or more of the companies have more than
1/3 outside directors on board. So that's the current situation.

So that being the case, I think we now have a very good situation. And that's because the corporate governance code was delivered as a concrete
model by the governance -- by the government and to help create the situation. So that, I believe, is one of the outputs and result of the administration.
Actually, we'll come to this later on. We have form, but what is the substance? Is there -- in terms of substance, do we have a situation first around
corporate governance management, like that we have in U.S. and Europe, that I believe is the challenge.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
Okay. So moving on to the next point. So corporate governance code has various principles, especially regarding the Board of Directors of the
responsibilities and the transparency are important themes. From your view, Mr. Sakakibara, which point do you think is particularly important?

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
The top one, evaluation -- the effectiveness of the Board. Board is the most important, highest decision-making body of the company. So the
corporate strategy needs to be deliberated sufficiently there. Outside directors need to take part from the shareholder and society view. Leading
the discussion from the societal view, shareholder view is important.

So in pursuing corporate governance code, the company's growth strategy, profit generation will be pursued. So from outside directors, the
shareholders, you need to be included to pursue the growth strategy. In compliance, I need to be overseeing, supervised. So that is the most
important role of the Board.

And another point is the nomination and compensation committee. The growth strategy is an important component of the company, but nomination
or denial, rejection of the executives from the shareholders' view, rejection of the CEO may be necessary in some cases. And that takes time frequently
in U.S. and Europe. So the outside directors need to play a role there. And at the same time, as you see here, for remuneration, transparency and
the objectivity and the strategy viewpoint is required. Outside directors need to supervise from shareholder and social view. So these principles
listed here, to realize them, the outside directors have a big role to play.

Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
Understood. So now let us review what NTT has done so far. So Sakakibara-san, you talked about this as the most important thing, the effectiveness
of the Board, evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board. From around 2015, NTT has had the involvement of Mr. Sakakibara. The independent
outside directors and the independent auditors had discussions. NTT DATA, NTT DOCOMO's outside directors and holding companies' outside
directors had discussions. So in various forms, and of course, discussion with the executive side, too, we've had many realms of discussions.

And in addition, from 2018, directors and auditors survey, questionnaire started. In the 2018 questionnaire, governance, organizational design,
whether we should study organizational design more or not? For this question, 80% to 90% replied, yes. So we've been discussing this topic for 1
or 2 years now. How did you see this as you were involved in the discussion?

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
Yes. As you mentioned, from around 2015, the governance had been discussed in many fora. In the past 2 years, after Mr. Sawada became the
President, governance reform has progressed significantly, I think. Outside directors have been involved in many areas to be involved in the
discussion on strategy. And for governance reform from around 2 years ago, we started the discussion.

So in the course of this discussion, a company of NTT size and a company that will pursue global expansion going forward, NTT's governance
structure, organizational design, eventually need to have companies with nomination committee. So needless to say, the executive side and the
supervision side is clearly divided. In the 3 companies, nomination, remuneration and audit committee will have the independent authority and
the majority members will be outside directors. And the overall directors -- outside director will account for major in the overall directorship.

So the supervision, that is the ultimate form of well-supervised format. So that is what we suggested. And you've conducted the organizational
design this time. As you mentioned here, the company corporate with corporate auditors is maintained, but you have a big reform. So you have
the executives outside, you had 15 members before the change and 2 outside directors. But after the change, the total is 8 directors, of which 4

                                                                                                                                                                             
 are outside, 4 is internal. One is nonexecutive. So executive is 3, nonexecutive is 5. So this is a well-governed director structure, we think. And 1
female in the outside director and 2 in the audit. So in terms of gender diversity, we are making good progress.

And another important point is this nomination and remuneration committee's role is enhanced. The transparency objectiveness are insured in
the discussion. It was established in June. So we just got started. But starting June, NTT's governance structure has stepped up, I think.

Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
Yes, as you just correctly mentioned, starting this summer, strategic discussions have become deeper because we optimized the size of the board.

And another important point is diversity. So among the directors and auditors, of the 13, 3 are female. Under NTT law, you have to have the Japanese
nationality to be a director. So unfortunately, those with foreign nationality cannot become the director of NTT Holding Company. But instead, we
established global intermediate holding company. And we -- 4 foreign nationals are appointed to capture our global insight and knowledge. What
do you think about that?

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
Yes. In this NTT's organizational reform, the directors and auditors, total 3 females are appointed, and I think this is highly significant. Gender
diversity is very important in the decision-making.

In the U.S. statistics, female directors, companies with 2 or more female directors and the ones who don't, if you draw a line and compare the ROE
between the 2 groups, there's a gap of 2%. So companies with 2 or more female directors, ROE is 2% higher. So if the female are involved in the
executive, the discussion becomes more active. And the management's decision-making quality is enhanced, and this is proving it.

So in the June organizational reform, 3 female executives are coming on board. And I think it's an important step. Originally, foreign nationals
should be part of the structure, it will be the best. But as you mentioned, in the case of NTT foreign nationals cannot take part. But it's an issue for
the future. As we're going to purse global operations further, then it's important that foreign nationals be on the board as an outside independent
director. I think that's the structure you should aspire to achieve. So it's an issue for the future. We have 2 officers as executives as well. So we are
trying to enhance that.

Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
So let's go on to the next topic then.

Mr. Sakakibara, earlier you talked about the Appointment and Compensation Committee. And they have a very critical role to play. In the case of
NTT, we have already -- in 2005, we already had voluntary appointment and compensation committee, especially over 5 times we had discussions
for this committee over personal management, and also with regard to compensation, remuneration question as well. So what are your impressions
about the discussions taking place in those committees?

Sadayuki Sakakibara - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Independent Outside Director
So in 2012, when I was appointed as the Outside Independent Director of NTT System, I've been a member of the Appointment and Compensation
Committee along the way. In the initial couple of years, we had the form. But the -- what would happen is that committees would present a personal
plan. That was the nature of the meeting.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 But as I mentioned earlier, under Mr. Sawada, we began to have discussions, more substantive discussions at the Appointment and Compensation
Committee. Appointment and Compensation Committee plays a very critical role, especially when it comes to appointment, they play a very critical
role. And that is the expectation, in particular for the company. Appointment and the CEO -- appointment of CEO and President, this is extremely
critical. So that has to be determined with the viewpoint of investors in mind.

So decision of CEO that should be fully deliberated at the Appointment and Compensation Committee. So it's not just a matter of presenting
proposal. It's important that you have a long list, bearing in mind the candidate for the future. You should explain the long list of candidates. And
on the 1, you should -- along the way, through discussions, you should narrow down and then appoint the candidate -- decide on the candidate,
that's the CEO. That's the process which we proposed in order to get with the process, which you actually took into consideration.

Akira Shimada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - Senior EVP, CFO, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer &
Representative Director
So I think I was able to play a role as a member of this committee. With regards to executive officers, in the case of selection of executive officers,
as is pointed out here, clarification of expected missions and specifications needs to be done. It's important that we have a selection of diverse
candidates. It's important that we select members from diverse candidates.

And as Mr. Sakakibara pointed the fact that the Appointment and Compensation Committee, I believe, the nature of the discussion in this committee
really evolved. So let me go on. So procedures to determine the remuneration of executives. As you pointed out earlier, it's important that the
corporate performance will be determined by the remuneration of the executives, right now the monthly remuneration and the bonus. We have
70% monthly remuneration and 30% performance-linked remuneration, that is the breakdown. In the midterm target, we appointed adverse KPIs
in the medium-term financial management strategy and we may -- we delivered on these KPIs.

Unidentified Analyst
In terms of the KPIs, which were said, what are your thoughts? If you could share that with us Mr. Sawada.

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Well, monthly -- so fixed remuneration, monthly remuneration and performance-linked remuneration bonus categories into 2. That represents a
major progress. And also when setting performance remuneration, you clarified KPI. That was very important. In the case of NTT and holding
company, you have a very wide-ranging business operations all the way from IT to real estate and also to global. So setting of KPI requires a lot of
creativity. It has to be fair, clear and transparent. Also the KPI should be very productive. And that's how you should determine the KPI to be adopted.
And that needs to be presented to the investors as well. That's how you will be able to ensure transparency. So that's the management this time
which we would like to see.

Well, right now, in the case of staff remuneration, this is something -- an ongoing discussion. And I do hope that we'll be able to take a look at the
various global companies and also take a look at the blue-chip Japanese companies to use them as a reference and deepen our discussion on this
point. That is what we want to achieve.

I'm afraid we are running out of time. So let us now take a question from the audience.

Unidentified Analyst
Can I just say one last word? NTT and others, the corporate governance reform has progressed significantly, but this is not the final form. The form,
the shape is in place. More than 94% of companies have 2 or more outside and 1/3 significant majority. But the operation, that allows the proper
function of outside directors. Some are doing, others are only having the shape, the form, but not substantially, not in substance. So outside directors

                                                                                                                                                                             
 express the opinions for company President's proposal, but do not like oppose in some cases. So in order to enhance the growing capability, it has
to have good discussion. So the outside director needs to be involved from the shareholder and society's view to allow for high-quality strategy.
COVID-19 has not settled. But in post-COVID era, what will the world be like? And what will be the management challenges?

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
The post-COVID will be a completely different world. So how should the management strategy be pursued? Until now, the shareholder profit had
been a very important point. But in post-COVID, of course, shareholder value is important, but society, contribution to society will be very important.
Environment, equality or the narrowing of gaps, disparity and FBG's, companies need to address these challenges. So outside directors need to
have this view of the society and view of the shareholders and express their views clearly, this is the challenge for all the companies. So this is what
I have in mind recently. NTT's medium-term strategy is the solving -- resolving resolution of social challenges. So I hope you could look at us
rigorously so that we can work harder. So we will now take questions.

Unidentified Analyst
Mr. Sawada, Mr. Sakakibara, thank you very much for engaging this dialogue. Mr. Sawada about the medium-term management strategy, I know
that you have been leading the company -- you will be leading the company for many years to come, but I wanted to ask about the structure of
the organization?

Unidentified Company Representative
To be more specific, you might say, ""Oh, not about NTT DATA again, you might say that again. But my understanding about NTT DATA is that for
the past 15 to 25 years, very little synergy was realized with that company. That is because the structural -- the structure of the company and the
elements of the operation, there are many factors. And I think it's going to be impossible for you to realize synergy with NTT DATA. So there's a
very strange demarcation and both -- and you're actually a drag on each other. So why not sell off the company? And why not find a new partner?
I think that's probably better for the growth of the respective companies. That's my view, especially in the recent.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
It's been couple of years since you became the President of the company. And the latter half of Mr. (inaudible) administration, they had a task force.
But despite those deliberations, you have no concrete output, and I really can't expect any concrete outlook going forward. So what is the meaning
of hanging on to NTT DATA? What are your thoughts about my proposal that you sell off your stake and NTT DATA? I would appreciate your
response.

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Thank you, Mr. Kikuchi for this question, it's a very bold view. To be quite candid, as far as NTT DATA is concerned, have I ever considered selling
off of NTT DATA? I have given that a thought. But NTT DATA, from your perspective and NTT DATA from my perspective probably are different. I
think we view NTT DATA in a different way.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
And what about the future?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
NTT DATA is thinking that they want to focus on consulting and the world of IT is shifting to software. For example, Everest is right now providing
the back system -- backend system for Telefonica. Naturally, this can be delivered to 5G world as well. So we are now partner with NEC including
various systems and that system can now be sold by Everest could be sold by NTT DATA. That model is becoming more invisible. So when we take
a look at the future, there is indeed, a universe where such synergy can be more easily acquired. So right now the focus is on consulting. System
integration that is focused on consultation and consulting. It is important that they be part of NTT Group, it is important that we have such system
integration player within the NTT Group. Actually I'm hoping that this player will become the central player in NTT Group.

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
So is there a possibility that the company could be sold off?

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
That possibility is part of the -- I know there are many possibilities. However, for myself, I want to make sure that we hang on to NTT DATA so that
we would be able to deliver further synergy for the future. Have I responded to your question?

Satoru Kikuchi - SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Your mentioned the future, what about the time line? What about the sense of speed? Do you believe that while you're still at the helm of the
company, some sort of output or results can be visible? Is that your sense?

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Yes, I believe we can become visible from one thing. For example, with Toyota we were able to launch this initiative and we're trying to create a
platform for NTT DATA development team and NTT Labs, working together to create and develop such a platform to drive this auto drive --
autonomous drive platform. So therefore, this is going to be component of the platform. We'll just talk about platform. So it's important that various
systems we implemented introducing to the cars. And this will require a 5G system to drive this and managing the system. That requires the capacity
of NTT Communications.

So that being the case, the application that is developed by NTT DATA, that could be actually together with partners outside the group and also
with up companies be sold off to other players. So NTT DATA is going to be at the core of the B2B2X model. And we believe that this is something
that can be delivered within the next couple of years.

Unidentified Company Representative
Thank you very much. If I may add to one other word, with MIS Kyushu Corporation we involved in value chain innovation. That also involves NTT
DATA. By expanding that, we believe that IT modernization can be pursued in both wireless and fixed line environment. So this could be driven
by NTT DATA. This could be delivered much earlier on, I believe. I just wanted to add that. Thank you very much for that.

Unidentified Analyst
NTT DATA, do they have the willingness to become the central player at NTT Group. I never felt that intention on the part of NTT DATA. What about
you?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Well, it's been 2 years since being the President of NTT and I've been talking about this quite repeatedly. And I think Mr. Honma, the President of
NTT DATA is now having that type of recognition. It's true that in the past, I would say, NTT DATA should be at the center. But then they will say,
no, we want to be at the margins of the group. But right now, that type of discussion is going on over there. They are not saying that, yes. NTT
DATA is saying that they are considering how they can support NTT in the collaborations. I think they're gradually coming to the center of NTT
Group. Thank you very much. We are looking forward to that. Thank you very much.

Next question is from Macquarie Capital, Mr. Yamashina.

Hiroshi Yamashina - Macquarie Research - Analyst
This is Yamashina from Macquarie. I have a question on the long-term view on R&D. So DOCOMO after becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary, the
Yokosuka and Musashino R&D roles and responsibility in IOWN? Are there changes in the roles and responsibilities? Do you have any thinking
there? And in IOWN and the positioning of NTT DATA was just asked earlier. NTT DATA's positioning in IOWN, how should we understand that?

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Thank you. So first, including DOCOMO, the holding company's R&D and DOCOMO's R&D will missing an assignment change. We have not decided
on anything. We need to discuss that going forward. It's one of the important agenda items. But I think we need to change. In other words, the
basic research will be holding company R&D and DOCOMO combined a new organization or holding company done by itself. So the fixed line and
mobile need to be covered both. So the basic research need to cover both.

On the other hand, DOCOMO will develop service and applications, and develop areas that are close to our customers. That will be done by DOCOMO
R&D in a more enhanced manner. So Comware and Com R&D members will support that. So I think it will be polarized.

In IOWN, IOWN is very broad based. NTT DOCOMO is focusing on wireless format. Next is 6G, but wireless software platform that is integrated
behind the scene, so Shibutani talked about the integration. There is this integrated part. So we want to work on that together. And so the mission
will change in that direction in NTT DATA's role. The system construction capability and the know-how and capability and expertise data has strong
expertise there. So NTT DATA does not do basic research. Rather, with customers, with partners, the system will be built. And the seeds in the R&D
will be captured by data in the downstream. Different from the past, the elemental technology developed in R&D will be developed into a solution
into data by data. For example, the system to detect abnormalities, NTT DATA is developing the solutions and sell them. So data can be captured
in upstream and downstream. Does this answer your question?

Hiroshi Yamashina - Macquarie Research - Analyst
Yes, I understand.

Next question from Daiwa Securities, Mr. Ando.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
Ando here. I have a question about R&D and IOWN, in particular. It's a very large, very lofty vision. You -- in order to have global talent to commit
to this, how do you tend to communicate this? Your ability to provide a narrative, what you intend to do about it? For example, NVIDIA, do you
believe that if they do -- if they work well, then you'll be able to get the global talent? Or are you going to create a resource center so they will be
able to capture global talent? So can you share with us your thoughts, if you will, and your policy about how to capture global talent?

Unidentified Company Representative
Well, In terms of development, I think there's a need to consolidate those centers. That is true. But before we get to that stage, NTT Labs and NTT
DOCOMO need to collaborate. And maybe we could create such a central organization for NTT DOCOMO and Labs can cooperate. So center for
development and working with partners, that type of organization will be required so. And as a precursor to that, IOWN Development Center,
IOWN Development offices now established with the NTT holding company. And that needs to translate into concrete centers going forward. But
as you mentioned, Mr. Ando, to promote that and to provide a narrative so that people can understand what we're doing, that is an area where it
is who we have not done sufficiently. Are we going to do this or are we going to do this based on our own team or not? Quite recently, I hope that
we'll be able to make some sort of an announcement about what we're going to do. And there's a third element. Right now, domestically, we have
enormous amount of facilities.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
But all photonics network that will be developed through IOWN, how will this be introduced? When we sell this outside Japan, whatever migration
plan can we present and propose?

Unidentified Company Representative
It's important that we set a very concrete implementation plan, and we need a team to promote implementation. So development, promotion and
introduction and delivery. So I think we need 3 types of organization as we go forward. I hope that answered your question.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
Well, in the case of NTT, I know that we can expect a lot from efforts to be made on the part of NTT holding company, but your ability to communicate
globally based on English language. How do you see your capacity to provide such a narrative in English?

Unidentified Company Representative
Well, we have teams such as NTT Limited and NTT DATA team in Japan that are already out there. And also the ability to promote IOWN. I think
there's a distance between the 2.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
So are we going to create such an organization or team together with our partners on a joint venture basis?

Unidentified Company Representative
I think we're not yet at that stage. So for the next year or 2, it's important that we pursue opportunities before we make joint announcements. By
the way, in the case of IOWN Global Forum, everything is conducted in English. All the participants must communicate based on English language.
So I believe the members who are participating in the IOWN probably will not feel any stress about communicating in English.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
I see. My second question relates to the first question. In the case of optical chips, when it comes to chips, technologically speaking, what type of
chips need to be developed?

Unidentified Company Representative
It's very difficult to see from people outside the group. But when we look back in history, behind the development of semiconductor, there's a large
contribution from the development of SBEs.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
So in the case of photonics, in terms of cost reduction and mass production, de facto technology needs to be developed. And need industries to
support this initiative, but what are some of the challenges you see as you try to further spread and develop the required chips down the road?

Unidentified Company Representative
Well, it is, as you pointed out, when we take a look at the current semiconductor chips, there are a lot of complicated long process involved in
semiconductors and chips and the edging component. The edging part will be done through electronic form, but no, that's not the case. We want
to add photonic component on top of the chips edging. We don't want to use photonics or electronics rather.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
So it's -- so in principle, it's a semiconductor type of process. But how do we implement the photonic electronic convergence component and the
device-related technology needs to be developed in parallel. NTT Laboratories and NTT Electronics, that's a subsidiary firm. They're already creating
semiconductors. So although -- they have the ability to develop and produce photonics electronics convergence, although not on a massive scale.
So how do we introduce such a line?

Unidentified Company Representative
We have a very small-scale line already.

Yoshio Ando - Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Research Analyst
So how can we expand that in the future?

Unidentified Company Representative
Naturally, Intel and NVIDIA, both companies are now shifting to fabless production. So how do how do we identify production technology and
with whom, that's going to be a major issue. So yes, I think your question is very much on the mark. Thank you very much for that.

Next question is UBS Securities, Mr. Takahashi please.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Kei Takahashi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Telecom & Software Analyst
Yes. This is Takahashi from UBS. I have 2 questions. First, in the first R&D presentation, the virtualization and IOWN were explained. As business, I
think virtualization will be launched sooner as the business. So once again, including your global vendors, we are all moving in the similar direction,
so NTT, NEC collaboration. Where is your strength, your competitive advantage? And what time line do you have to have a positive impact on your
financial results?

Unidentified Company Representative
First of all, the point I would like to communicate is the collaboration with NEC. And we are also in discussion with Fujitsu too. So Japanese vendors
in 4G and 5G device, we are still small. As Shibutani said today, in the vertical integration structure, we had little room to enter because of lack of
sales and engineering. On a global basis, we lack in sales and engineering capability. And we cannot expand this overnight, but all ORAN equipment,
there are not so many ORAN equipment around the world. So if the ORAN is discussed, many formats will come into play. I cannot name the carriers,
but LETT -- LEC equipment is one suggestion. In that case, NTT will support as (inaudible) and NEC will become the manufacturer, and the software
will be combined and the carrier will be used. So there are no other comparators, if you will. So if the carriers say we want to introduce ORAN, NEC
and Fujitsu have the advantage to begin with. Altiostar vRAN may be the competitor.

So are you -- or do you see you -- the interface, the intra availability is not insured yet on a software base. So we are still equal on equal footing.
Time line will be 1 to 2 years. We think this expand in 1 or 2 years.

Kei Takahashi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Telecom & Software Analyst
My second question is, so core virtualization. So PSTN and IT network will be integrated, you said. So east and west network will be included here.
They will also be part of this virtualization. Any legal impediments or obstacles?

Unidentified Company Representative
East and west are now -- we are thinking of them as wholesaler. So the basic node wholesale part that east and west uses and the service part that
the mobile carriers will use on top of that, the core software, I think, will be divided into 2. So as has been informed, in 2024, PSTN will be migrated
to IP, the FLETs Optical side.

Kei Takahashi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Telecom & Software Analyst
But we are talking about beyond that. So will we use the optical phone forever?

Unidentified Company Representative
No, not really. The communications line phone and Skype phone are already changing. And so the critical voice communication still remains. That's
also a fact.

Kei Takahashi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Telecom & Software Analyst
So the Node, the Cornette, what kind of combination will be needed?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
Maybe it will be mobile-centered with fixed-line critical. But as I said earlier, east and west will have some part and the operating companies will
have the other parts. We think there will be a division.

Kei Takahashi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Executive Director and Telecom & Software Analyst
Yes, I understand.

Next question from Merrill Lynch, Mr. Kinoshita.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
Kinoshita here. I hope you can hear my voice.

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes, we hear you clearly.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
I would like to ask several questions, if I may. I know that there have been repeated questions both about ORAN and vRAN, let me ask question
about your philosophy or thoughts.

In principle, NTT DOCOMO will be positive in addressing ORAN and vRAN. But at the same time, though, Nokia and Ericsson they are not earnest
about this. So at the end of the day, we are -- we see the situation being stalled. I think that is the prevailing situation or that's the image that I have.
But in the case of incumbents, they have a certain scale of operation. Nokia is very reluctant to come on board. And Ericsson also has no intentions.
Can you really introduce ORAN with the presence of those carriers? I'm somewhat skeptical about the possibility of ORAN and vRAN. So if you could
talk about that?

Unidentified Company Representative
Thank you for your question. I suppose that's one way of putting it. When we take a look at the various trends in places like U.S., U.S. government
authorities understand that ORAN is beginning to move. At the same time though, they understand the presence of vRAN. For players like Nokia
and Ericsson, they already have vertical integrated model and they're trying to recommend that. In Samsung -- in the case of Samsung, Verizon
wants to use Samsung. That also represents a bit of vertical integration as well. So I think it's going to really be a competition between these camps.

In the case of DISH, it's a combination of RTU.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
So will it be ORAN, will it be vRAN, will it be combination or will it be vertical integration?

I think carriers will continue to lead the situation. It's a combination of which models offer the greatest advantage. In the case of NTT, as a carrier,
we -- one of the reasons why we believe ORAN is most positive is because you're able to have control over your software. You're able to strengthen
your competitiveness under the ORAN model. And going forward, the hardware will be hotbox, but value added can be captured. So offering
inexpensive hardware dedicated system, that's our intention. So carriers that are in line with this thought, probably will come onboard for ORAN
or maybe they'll skip ahead to vRAN eventually perhaps. But I know that this is not the response to your question. You mentioned that you're
skeptical. This will be all determined by the market. It will be determined by the competition, and we have to make sure that we don't lose out in
this competition.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
Let me go back to what your comment. DOCOMO has the technological capacity. But non-Japanese carriers do they have sufficient ability to control
softwares?

Unidentified Company Representative
Well, the carriers in developed countries, they want to be able to exercise control over their software. That seems to be the situation. But outside
Japan, carriers and vendors are very close, and the management team actually hop between the 2. So there's a different factor at play.

In the case of developing economies, they probably have a preference for full turn key and that's a possibility. But is it -- but at the end of the day,
it's all about cost performance. So security whereby you're able to exercise or your own control or a free hand whereby you'll be able to drive
growth and is the trade-off between the 2, control and growth.

So right now, a very limited number of developed economies perhaps are involved in this whole discussion.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
I see. Point taken. Second question, let me confirm. This goes back to Mr. Ando's question earlier in the case of optical chips, photonics chips. As
far as the chips are concerned, you mentioned that competition is primarily with existing systems who are able to extend their limitation, is that
the case? Is that the only competition that you have? Also when you produce optical or photonic chips, are there other potential production
methodologies? And is there a possibility that a different type of production methodology could emerge as a competition to the current photonics
chips? Is there a possibility that you'll not be able to take the lead and that you'll lose out from benefiting from mass scale production? If you could
clarify the situation for us?

Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Thank you for that. In the case of photonics or electronics converged chips, NTT was covered by Nature's article last year. And the reason why
Nature, the journal covered this is because this is already being implemented. And IBM, Huawei, these players in relation to digital signal processing,
wanted to adopt photonics and electronics convergence. I understand that they actually produce this. But then they were not able to spread the
technology. So technological breakthrough needs to make sure that on top of silicon, photonics be introduced. How do you place photonics on
top of the silicon, so NTT has that edge. So the competition -- in terms of competition within photonics and electronics convergence, NTT is one
step ahead without a doubt.

Also, as mentioned by Mr. Shibutani earlier, we're talking about 6 nano to 7 nano universe. We're talking about the edging, but this could probably
come down to 2 nanos eventually. So the level of concentration could actually improve. However, the situation with regard to temperature will
still remain. So energy consumption, power consumption is the key. So either photonics and electronics convergence is delivered. It's a matter of
power consumption. It's a trade-off. So within photonics and electronics convergence, we are ahead. In terms of comparison with existing chips,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 it's a discrepancy between the performance, but the limit will come. See eventually photonics and electronics convergence will probably go ahead
compared to the existing chips.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
I see. Then in terms of your technology, photonics and electronics convergence, I know that you have not disclosed this. But unless you have a
third-party manufacturer and involve industries, this -- the base for this technology probably will not spread. Are you going to consider licensing
for this technology? Is that the case?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes, I take your point, but we're not yet at that stage. And also, when we talked about photonics and electronics converge chips, the first usage
will probably be in the digital signal processing. But the interposer needs to be converted into photonics. And then later on, we need multi-layer
for the chips. That model is already visible. So placing photonics and electronics converge material on top of the silicon, it will come later. So what
type of value chain will be created for the industry, that needs to be organized beforehand.

So let me rephrase this. So interposer connecting chips. Interposer will probably be developed within the next couple of years. Are we going -- we
have to consider whether or not we're going to produce this and see this as an industry. So the -- so it's important that with players like Intel and
NVIDIA, we discussed that. My personal view is that maybe, hopefully, we'll have the ability to produce that eventually. It's not yet determined.

Yoshiyuki Kinoshita - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Research Analyst
Can -- is there a possibility that you will become a FAB?

Unidentified Company Representative
Well, as I mentioned earlier, we already have a FAB that's carried out by one of the subsidiary firms. But this is limited to chips for the -- it's only
limited. We already delivered that to Huawei. But because of the National Defense Authorization question, we've stopped delivering that to Huawei
last year. But we have manufacturers. So we have that ability. Please bear that in mind.

Operator
Next question is from Citigroup Securities, Mr. Tsuruo.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
This may digress from today's topic, but I want to ask you a question about power in the resource, the -- you will do the offshore wind power
generation you said. So as of now, including J. Power in the power generation, what kind of investment are you thinking of in the next 10 years?
So J. Power, what kind of return are you thinking of or the power source development?

Unidentified Company Representative
So the regional grid, we want to do this direct current, Anode. This is the one terminal on direct current. So that is the basis. So in power generation,
there was some miscommunication. So power distribution was how the mass media understood and wrote the articles on. But we will work on the
power generation, renewable energy, and that will be JPY 600 billion in 10 years. But this is not -- the JPY 600 billion is not just our own cash. We
will work with partners and do take this off balance. And go up to JPY 600 billion. Right now, it's a little less than JPY 300 billion profit. But in it, with

                                                                                                                                                                             
 -- in its resale, so by having the power source, we can improve the operating margin. But because of the nature of the power, this will not go up
that significantly. So in the next 10 years, we will use renewable energy. We only use 4%. And so we will rise this to 30%. And through -- deliver this
through Anode. And so use that as a baseload and be -- and when the oil supply stops, we can generate power on our own. So that is the energy
vision along with the environment vision, and this has started.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
Understood. Another different theme. If you cannot answer this fine because it's during TLV, but NTT DOCOMO on the subscriber base is largest,
but a third player in terms of profit. So there's a structural problem in price. So that was the price if you align yourselves with other parties. So
(inaudible) and NTT executives, what do you think is the opportunity in your cost structure?

Unidentified Company Representative
So first, others have the long distance and international and wireless together. In case of DOCOMO, when it separated in 1992, the facilities had to
be owned by themselves, that was ordered by the rule. But this time, this discussion on DOCOMO was judged that it is not a legal judgment. And
therefore, Com's backbone is the largest in long distance. And DOCOMO backbone want to be combined, integrated in buildings. DOCOMO is
newer. So DOCOMO's building will be used as node. And Com will be integrated into that.

So the first point is the total cost of facility. Group can work to reduce the cost there. Second is IT system. This is also discussion centering on cost
reduction. We have a company called DOCOMO Systems and the ERP that is developed there is used within the group. In the next few years, SAP
-- we are trying to shift to SAP cloud. And Comware will drive this. DOCOMO Systems and Comware need to be discussed. So collaborate or merge
or combine. By combining them, we can reduce more cost. And we want to start studying that. At this point, I just have this in my brain. We have
not discussed it yet. But these facilities and IT cost reduction can be possible.

Mitsunobu Tsuruo - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Analyst
I understand.

Operator
I'm afraid that the time to complete the session has come, our apologies, but this will be the final question for the session. We apologize. Next
question from Nomura Securities, Mr. Masuno.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
I know that this is the final question. My question is this. It's not so much about NTT, but because of -- well, I want to talk about the future of the IT
industry, telecom industry, inclusive of your competition. With fixed line broadband spreading, with smartphones having 80% penetration, and
there is a price-related pressure. But in the case of open Internet, new smartphone-based payment is now emerging and we see enormous payment
business emerging and they're converging. In retail power, contents are now being integrated in the form of super applications. So in terms of this
consumer-related trend, what -- how should telecom industry change going forward? That's my first question.

My second is about business. We're not in the 5G, 6G era. And I think it's only natural that fixed and mobile network be converged. And if you put
on top of the data center, the network added value will increase. And also, large data cloud -- data service operators are now beginning to come
into this area. So against this business environment, how should the telecom industry change? How should they address this ongoing trend? I
would appreciate your thoughts about the industry as a whole.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jun Sawada - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation - President, CEO & Representative Director
Thank you very much. Let me talk about the retail individual users. DOCOMO is pushing, of course, this smart life business. In the case of fixed-line
business, in the case of mobile as well, they try to generate profit and now the prices is based on flat rate. Not so much usage space. It's not so
much based on usage rate system. Once the market becomes mature, you shift to flat rate system. But the upper layer contents and payment
business naturally is emerging on the other hand.

In the case of payment, it's all about finance and money. And there's going to be a lot of demand. In the case of health care, it's about life. This is
also going to be a very major segment. And also, the emotion and the mental universe, in other words, how do you deepen communication. And
the other is about comfort, a sense of comfort. So then we come to robotics. So this also involves mobility as well.

So in order to make individuals want more service secure and even richer, from that perspective, up until now, elements there also had the telecom
industries now began to be part of this universe. So that, I believe, is the situation of the discussion pertaining to the consumer side of the business.
So telecommunication is simply one of the elements.

In the case of health care medical, it's very important -- it's very large. Wearable devices are very -- now increasing and if implantable devices are
to be incorporated, the situation will really change. On the other hand, when it comes to business, as you pointed out, what we're offering as cloud
is primarily private cloud and it's very customized. In the case of public cloud, we were in important for the cloud, but AWS, Google and Azure, we
could not be victorious against those players. So we shifted our thinking, and we decided to offer a hybrid fashion. And we decided to deliver
solutions that offer hybrid. But that alone would not be sufficient to compete against these giants. But these are players in the application front
that really have global dominance.

In the case of ORAN and vRAN, who comes after ORAN and vRAN, they're beginning to engage in the software side of the equation. So I believe
that people -- some say that we should compete against these players because they are not getting -- they are now entering the telecom field.
Why do we need to compete with them? Because I think the telecom industry's weight in the business community will increase going forward. For
example, all things will be connected. And this applies to autonomous drivers, plus every functions in the cities and urban settings. It also applies
to implantable devices in all aspects of individual lives. So offering connection and platforms, these players are trying to make platforms their own.
So as for telecom carriers are concerned, it's important that we offer those platforms on our own to the world. So therefore, that is going to be the
competition going forward. So communication for the business, this is going to be essential. This is the most essential component as we try to
deliver value. I hope we are on the same page.

Daisaku Masuno - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division - Head of Information & Telecommunication Team, Japan & Analyst,
Telecommunications Research, Japan
Yes. In terms of consumer, it's a very data question, I apologize. But in terms of consumers, when it comes to the new approach, I think health care
and life is going to be very important, especially in post-COVID-19 universe. And also in terms of business -- dealings with business, as you pointed
out right now, we have no idea who is controlling the software. Is it the vendors? Or is it the service operators? So I think that's the universe that
we're headed to. So how you get -- how you dominate the market is going to be very critical?

Yes. I take your point. So yes, trying to take the piece of the market, is it going to be the manufacturers? Or is it going to be the likes of GAFA? Or
is it going to be the conventional traditional carriers? Or is it going to bring even customers? Or is it going to be devices like Apple?

Unidentified Company Representative
I think all possible scenarios are out there. And this applies to both the business market and to the mass market. So as you pointed, Mr. Masuno, I
think we are beginning to be a global competition, that is transcending various boundaries. And the focus is going to be on this type of global
competition that transcends various boundaries.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay
purposes. (Operator Instructions)

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.

David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Head of IR
Thank you, Amanda. Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; and Michael McMurray, our
CFO.

During this call, we will review this morning's announcement of LyondellBasell's Louisiana Integrated PolyEthylene joint venture with Sasol.
Following the review, we will open the line for your questions. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide
presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.

Today, we will be discussing our business while making reference to some forward-looking statements. We believe the forward-looking statements
are based upon reasonable assumptions. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage
                                                                                                                                                                             
 you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides
and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.

Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone, beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today until December
2, by calling (800) 333-0467 in the United States and (203) 369-3627 outside the United States. Passcode for both numbers is 3652.

With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, and thank you for taking the time to join us on such short notice. We hope that you, your colleagues and your families
are all staying healthy during these challenging times.

This morning, we announced the completion of definitive agreements to form a new joint venture with Sasol. This transaction builds upon the
measured, strategic approach we have been taking to position our company for the future. This deal offers a unique opportunity to grow one of
the core areas of our business by investing in new, already-operating, high-quality assets that have tremendous upside as market conditions
continue to improve.

We recognize that this announcement might come as a surprise after we continue to pursue our highly disciplined financial strategy focused on
maximizing liquidity during the first 6 months of the pandemic. But we believe that this joint venture uniquely fulfills all of the highly selective
criteria we outlined for identifying and capturing value-minded, inorganic growth during industry cycles. We believe this acquisition will place
LyondellBasell in a stronger position as the economy recovers and our industry returns to normalized volumes and earnings.

Please turn to Slide 3 of the presentation we posted to our website this morning and allow me to describe this value in more detail. LyondellBasell
will purchase a 50% interest in the newly built ethylene cracker, 2 polyethylene units and associated utilities and infrastructure located in Lake
Charles, Louisiana for $2 billion. LyondellBasell will operate the assets on behalf of both partners for the joint venture.

This joint venture enables both partners to maximize the value of these world-class assets while advancing our respective strategic objectives. We
expect to obtain -- we expect to be able to obtain customary approvals and close the transaction before the end of this calendar year. While the
agreements do not set out a formal process, LyondellBasell has the potential to acquire the JV assets in full at some point in the future.

Today's acquisition has much in common with the integrated cracker joint venture that we established and started up with Bora in China just a
few weeks ago. When the 2 JVs are taken together, we are essentially acquiring the full capacity and immediate financial benefits of a new and
operational world-scale integrated cracker complex with minimal exposure to the risk from project execution, timing uncertainty and opportunity
costs that are typically incurred during the multiyear construction of these facilities, and we are acquiring these -- this world-scale integrated cracker
at a very attractive valuation.

In addition, we're not placing a big bet by building a project that depends upon a single geographic market for feedstock position. Between our
Bora JV and this transaction with Sasol, we expect profitable returns shortly after closing, with half of the capacity in the world's fastest-growing
market and the other half benefiting from some of the world's lowest feedstock costs.

Turn to Slide 4. Let's specifically talk about the joint venture with Sasol in Louisiana. The Lake Charles joint venture's integrated polyethylene
business is at the core of the largest value chain in LyondellBasell's portfolio and will serve to increase the extent of our global production arising
from advantaged, low-cost North American feedstocks.

We believe that our share of the joint venture will generate approximately $50 million in synergies for LyondellBasell over the next few years. And
both partners believe the value of these assets will be enhanced by leveraging LyondellBasell's global operational experience and know-how,
which will encompass over 17 million tons of annual olefin capacity and 16 million tons of polyolefin capacity upon the completion of this transaction.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the assets in more detail. Our diligence confirmed the assets are very well built with the scale, technologies and
feedstock advantage required to succeed in the global market. The partners have identified quick, low-cost opportunities to debottleneck capacity
that will enable the joint venture to capture synergies.

In addition, we believe that LyondellBasell's knowledge and experience in operating similar facilities provides opportunities to increase utilization
by improving operational uptime. The joint venture's low-density and linear low-density polyethylene capacity complements LyondellBasell's
existing North American capacity, which is predominantly high-density polyethylene.

And while it might be unlikely that integrated polyethylene margins will soon return to the high levels we saw in 2015, we believe the joint venture
is well positioned to capture cyclical upside over the coming years. I've spoken many times about our desire to identify acquisitions where
LyondellBasell's skills and competencies could add value through our ownership.

Turning to Slide 6. Allow me to highlight some of the ways that our company can contribute to this joint venture. We believe that our partner and
the Lake Charles employees are well aligned with LyondellBasell's fundamental focus on safety. That cascades benefits through reliable operations,
reduced waste to the environment and superior financial performance.

The joint venture will also benefit from implementing the best practices identified by our benchmarking and continuous improvement initiatives
across a global system of 13 ethylene crackers and dozens of polyethylene production lines. And LyondellBasell's global innovation capabilities
will serve to further enhance value creation from these assets.

Finally, please turn to Slide 7 and allow me to describe how this transaction is consistent with our commitments to disciplined capital allocation
and our investment-grade credit rating. We've been clear that LyondellBasell has no intention to begin building a new integrated ethylene cracker
in North America for the foreseeable future. Instead, we are making deep value investments in recently built, existing capacity without the risk that
frequently hamper returns from capital-intensive projects.

Our investments will provide returns within the first months instead of a distant future. The joint venture is expected to provide an unlevered
internal rate of return in the mid-teens for LyondellBasell. And it is expected to be accretive to both earnings per share and cash flow within 1 year,
exceeding our value-minded thresholds for investment.

We expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of debt and cash on our balance sheet. We believe that we can continue to largely fund our
dividend with cash from operating activities over the coming year. And as we prioritize deleveraging over share buybacks and grow our earnings
following the transaction, we should rapidly improve our credit metrics to ranges that are consistent with a solid investment-grade rating.

Let's turn to Slide 8 and conclude today's presentation with a few key takeaways. LyondellBasell is making a deep value investment in leading
assets during trough conditions, where we believe there is significant opportunity for cyclical upside. We are leveraging our advantaged positions
to maximize joint venture returns for both partners. We remain steadfast to our disciplined capital allocation principles, with the dual focus on
maintaining the dividend and our commitment to an investment-grade rating.

In conclusion, today's joint venture announcement represents another measured approach to extend one of LyondellBasell's core businesses and
increase free cash flow. Over the next 3 years, we look forward to new sources of annual recurring EBITDA as we harvest the fruits of our recent
growth investments.

This additional EBITDA will come from the following: over $200 million in annual synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition; $180 million to $200
million in annual estimated EBITDA from our capacity to produce the targeted product slate at our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant based on
historical margins; initial returns from our Chinese joint ventures with Bora and Sinopec as well as today's joint venture in Louisiana with Sasol;
lastly, $400 million to $450 million in annual estimated EBITDA in 2023 from the capacity at our new PO/TBA plant, again, based on historical
margins.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The end result is over $1 billion of incremental EBITDA from our recent growth investments. In addition, we expect substantial additional EBITDA
improvement as margins normalize and volumes recover from the depths of the pandemic across our existing asset footprint, particularly in value
chains that serve transportation fuels and automotive manufacturing.

When combined with our aggressive management of working capital, incremental cost-saving initiatives and reductions in CapEx, we believe
LyondellBasell is well positioned to increase free cash flow. And we will continue our highly disciplined approach to capital deployment. This
additional free cash flow will initially be directed towards deleveraging our balance sheet, followed by strengthening capital returns for our
shareholders.

With that, we'd be pleased to take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Two questions. The first is what's the level of leverage of the joint venture at its inception? And what might be the likely leverage of -- leverage
ratio of the joint venture over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
So Jeff, this is equity finance so there's no joint venture-level debt. We will take on debt at our level -- at the LyondellBasell corporate level.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And with the 300 kilotons of excess ethylene beyond the polyethylene that you'll pick up, are there any constraints on the sale of that ethylene
for you? That is, do you have to sell it at a cost-plus basis back to Sasol or some other entity? Or are you unconstrained?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, we presume that, as what occurs with other merchant sales, there's probably a combination of market-based and cost-based sort of sales. I
think, Jeff, what we're -- where we potentially can create more value with those pounds is that we have a very strong network in terms of pipelines
on both -- like on the Texas side, if you will, of the Gulf Coast. And now with the network and some connectivity that will get through this transaction,
we'll be able to sell ethylene in both Louisiana and in Texas directly.

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
But just to be clear, Jeff, it's -- each partners are encumbered. It's essentially a tolling JV rather than something more complicated.

Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director of Equity Research
It's our understanding that Sasol had planned to push at least 2/3 of the polyethylene from this complex into the U.S. market. What will you guys
do with that net increase in production?

And is it possible you would export more out of the Houston Ship Channel and move some of this more into the U.S.? But basically, what's the net
effect? Is it likely to reduce the risk of putting pressure on premium price in the U.S.?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. So the plan is for LyondellBasell to market 100% of the product -- of the polyethylene and -- LDP and LLDP. And our plan, Steve, is to plug that
into our global network. And the idea is to maximize value wherever we can do that.

So -- and as you know, we sell directly in many parts of Asia. We don't have LL capacity in Europe, so we could potentially supplement through
sales through Europe. So I think that's one of the other values we bring to this venture is a global marketing network that sells directly in most of
the major markets.

Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Congratulations on the transaction. I guess I did want to dig a little deeper on the strategic rationale here. I guess our perception was that Lyondell
was potentially moving a little bit more into -- LyondellBasell into harvest mode, and yet you have made some significant investments here with
the Bora JV and this one with Sasol.

And I guess we do understand that, effectively, you're making lower-risk investments here later in the production process and so, I guess, effectively
adding about a cracker's worth of production. So I guess is it just a great value for you? Or again, maybe that $2 billion could have been redirected
towards capital return or deleveraging a little bit sooner? How did you kind of get to this position that this was absolutely essential at this point?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Thank you, Arun. That's a good question. So some of the things I'm going to repeat back to you, what you said, which is that's certainly lower
risk. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, both projects, essentially, were running at the time we put the equity in. Certainly, Sasol, the JV is
running. And Bora was ramping up at the time.

I think, really, what this does is it strengthens our core business. We're able to be opportunistic and strengthen our core business. The cyclical
upside that I highlighted, we think, is a big driver in terms of why do this as opposed to delever or do buybacks. We think it's just a unique opportunity
to acquire world-scale new assets in both JVs, frankly. And in the case of the Bora JV, remember, that's 1/3 equity, 2/3 debt. So our capital or equity
required there was a lot less.

The other thing I really like about both of these ventures is that, in one case, we're leveraging low-cost feedstocks; in the other, we're producing
in the fastest-growing market in the world. So it's kind of a -- we're not just betting on one thing here. We're doing both. And I think in the case of
our Bora investment, it will really give us far better insights into the market in China. And remember, for that project, all of the production will stay
in China. So our intention is not to re-export any of that.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And lastly, we think all of this kind of positions us for higher returns, especially when you think through newbuild costs versus what we paid in
both, frankly, and then the cyclical upside that still lies ahead. So we really saw these as unique opportunities, strengthen the core, right time in
the cycle, low risk.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
And sorry, if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Some of those numbers you gave, I guess when you say historical margins, are you -- which period
are you referring to? I guess is that like the '14 through '19 period? Or maybe a little bit longer? Or how should we think about how to frame the
benefit from this?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
I wouldn't go all the way back to '14 because we don't think oil prices are going to get back to those kind of levels. Think about the last 3 years.
That's really how we think about historical margins.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.

Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
Congratulations, Bob.

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Thanks, Kevin.

Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
Can you tell us about the option that you have to acquire the balance of the 50% ownership to achieve full ownership in these assets over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, so Kevin, it's not formulaically kind of hardwired into the agreements. But the partners have an understanding that, over a period of time,
Sasol have indicated that they would focus on other derivatives at the site. And doing 100% of the marketing and operating the site positions us
to take that next step at the right time when both partners are ready. So I think that's probably the firmest indication of the next step is that,
essentially, we're operating and marketing.

Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
I see. And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about the specific sources of the $50 million in synergies that you envision and how that might
flow through over time?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Kevin, a lot of that is just increasing the uptime and really kind of running closer to nameplate capacity through our experience with running
multiple units around the world, whether it's crackers or polyethylene assets, and then, secondly, thinking through value on the marketing side
by marketing directly through our network globally.

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst
Congrats on the deal, Bob. Bob, how much new debt do you expect to issue in conjunction with this transaction?

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. It's Michael. So I mean just a couple of things I'd point out. So we ended the second quarter with liquidity of almost $6 billion. And then we
ended the second quarter with cash of just over $3 billion.

It would be our intention in the not-so-distant future to finance this asset, probably a little bit of cash and the majority of it being debt. And then
we'd probably take that opportunity to do some refinancing of some of our near-term maturities as well.

David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst
Good. And Michael, how will this JV be accounted for, consolidated or equity?

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So it's going to be accounted for essentially very similar to our PO JV in Europe. It won't be consolidated, so equity accounting, but we will be
able to record our proportional share of both revenue and EBITDA.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate
This is Angel Castillo on for Vincent. Just a quick question, a follow-up on your investments. Are there any other assets out there that you're
considering or, in terms of potential future acquisitions, that would continue to expand on this strategy of kind of acquiring things that are further
down the construction path? Or should we assume that you're kind of done with M&A or investments at this point?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Angel, we don't really see any other assets that are like this that have the kind of strategic rationale that I laid out. So our focus now is going to be
to get to closing as quickly as possible, get the rates to where we want, get a solid marketing plan in place. And as I mentioned, we're coming into
a period as a company where we're going to harvest the value from these investments we've been making over the past 5 years.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 So I'm looking forward to riding kind of the cyclical upside here with more assets than we had going into the pandemic. So -- and the cash flow,
again, our aim is to delever, first and foremost and get to a solid investment-grade rating. And we think there's still going to be opportunity to do
buybacks a couple of years down the road.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate
Understood. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on this asset. What's the cost basis of assets that are going to be included in the JV as
opposed to the full project's cost?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
No. It would be our acquisition costs essentially is what we bring across. So I think if you're asking me if there's some kind of write-down associated
with our acquisition, that would not be on our side.

Operator
Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Global Head of Chemicals & Agriculture Research and MD
Yes. I have a follow-up question on a previous question and then I have another question. Just quickly on this, your option to acquire the entire
joint venture, is there a trigger for that? Is that your option? Or is that Sasol's option?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, as I've mentioned earlier, it's not hardwired, but it's sort of the intent of the parties. And I think what sets us up for that is that we're essentially
the marketer and the operator. So it's something -- it's a principle that we've aligned around -- between the 2 partners.

Prashant N. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Global Head of Chemicals & Agriculture Research and MD
Okay. And your deal -- this deal may be opportunistic. But how should we think about Lyondell staying upstream in commodities versus going
downstream into specialties? Because based on your Schulman acquisition, some people thought that you might be going downstream. So can
you just give us your thoughts about how do you think about that?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Sure. So I think of Schulman as an extension of the value chains that we participate in today. And you'll remember that when we acquired A.
Schulman, we essentially doubled the existing compounding business. At the time, we had about $200 million of EBITDA in our base business. We
acquired $200 million of compounding EBITDA from Schulman. And then we put in about $175 million on Catalloy and polybutene-1 to comprise
what we call today the APS segment.

So I don't -- P.J., I don't think about that as a specialty versus commodity. I think about it as value chain. And I think about sort of a differentiated
commodity or differentiation and participation closer to end users with our compounding business. But I don't look for us to do a lot in real
specialties. That's really not our business. We'll stay within the value chains where we participate today.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And going as far as downstream as compounding makes a ton of sense for us because we make the base resins in polyethylene, polypropylene.
We have the technology. We have the olefins. We make the catalyst for the polyolefins. So if you think about integration, it makes a lot of sense,
and our ability, in the case of compounding, to be able to bring innovative solutions to the market quickly because we also make the base resin.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
This is a -- it's a big investment during uncertain times. I'm just curious, is there -- and you must have improved confidence, I guess, that the industry
can get back to better profitability over the next couple of years. So anything in particular you're seeing near term that gives you confidence that
we can get back to those margins over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Sure. So as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, I'm not implying here that we get back to 2014 kind of margins. But I think getting to --
over the past 3 years, in '17, '18, '19, over the next 3 to 5 years, very doable.

So first of all, if you look at how polyethylene demand has developed here during the pandemic, we actually see year-over-year demand growth
globally. We see year-over-year demand growth in the U.S., and we see year-over-year demand growth back to almost normal in China. So demand
growth in China year-to-date through August has grown something like 4% to 5%. U.S. is 1.5% kind of range, year-over-year growth. So almost 2%.

So -- and also on the supply side, Mike, we're starting to see delays, cancellations, partly because of visibility on oil price, partly because of financial
wherewithal of those who might want to build. So I've been through a lot of cycles over the 30-some years -- 30-plus years that I've been in the
business, and this is kind of how cycles work. And I think what's key is that you pay or have valuations at the bottom of the cycle that reflect the
bottom of the cycle. And I think, in a way, we've been able to achieve that.

And really high-quality assets that we're going to participate in here, great partner. We're looking forward to working with Sasol. And I think,
together, both Sasol and ourselves can ride the cyclical upside with world-scale assets.

Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
I have 45 questions, but I might settle for the top 2 or so. So I was wondering...

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
You can ask me one now and the other 44 to Dave later.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
I blame the pandemic. So I was wondering, you're already quite long in ethylene. And with this deal, you're getting longer still. Does this change
your strategic thinking about your ethylene position? And should we expect some derivative units being built soon?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. So first of all, Jonas, after the start of our Hyperzone plant, or about 500,000 tons long before this deal, so if you add another 300,000, we end
up at 800,000, which gets us to under 2 billion, roughly, in terms of pounds of ethylene in the U.S. We've been kind of in the 1 to 2 range for a few
years now. And I don't think that's too long.

We have a very extensive pipeline network, many long-standing relationships. Sasol selling some of that ethylene today. So I think it's still modest.
When you think about our overall portfolio and percent merchant position, on a percent basis, it's still quite low.

And your second question about would we consider building more derivative units. Not now, but in time, perhaps. I think we need to see how the
business develops, how operating rates develop over the next 3, 4 years. But that could be a middle-of-the-decade or second-half-of-the-decade
sort of decision. But to be clear, I do not anticipate us doing anything on derivatives in the next 3 to 4 years. We will maintain this net long position,
and we think it's very manageable.

Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD of Refining and Chemicals Research
So it was reported there were other parties interested, and it looks like you got a pretty good deal to us. Does this just simply come down to who
had the highest bid? Or were there some nonmonetary considerations that helped you win out?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, I mean, it's always hard to gauge competitive dynamics, and I don't want to speculate on a call like this. But I think, for us, what I hope our
partners saw was the value that we brought from an operating and marketing standpoint, ability to plug into a global network on marketing
immediately from day 1, and the possibility for them to retain 50% and ride some of the market upside before they made a decision on the second
50%. So that's kind of what I hope and know. The remaining competitive dynamics, it's difficult to really say.

Operator
Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Atlantic Global (sic) [Alembic Global].

Hassan Ijaz Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors - Partner & Head of Research
Bob, a question on valuation. If I take a look at greenfield replacement value of most of the projects that came onstream in the U.S. over the last
couple of years, on a sort of replacement value basis, you guys seem to be sort of purchasing these assets at a significant discount relative to those
replacement values.

So the question really is, does that just highlight what a good deal you guys have gotten? Or have you seen a meaningful sort of decline in newbuild
sort of replacement values as sort of the E&C side of the business has slackened a bit with sort of the flurry of newbuilds slowing down?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Hassan, it's a great question. It is not an indication of lower costs on the newbuild side. I think it's more reflective of the cycle and kind of where
we are in the cycle today. So as I mentioned in my earlier remarks on one of the other questions is that it's opportunistic. But I do think that we're
kind of at the bottom of the polyethylene cycle.

And as there have been many public announcements about delays or cancellation of projects on the supply side and on the demand side, we're
really seeing good growth even through a pandemic. And with the recovery, we might even see a year of above kind of average growth. We think
that the cycle should turn up here, and I think it's just timing in terms of where we are in the cycle and the ability to get this done at this time.

Our next question comes from Roger Spitz with Bank of America.

Roger Neil Spitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and High Yield Research Analyst
What do you estimate the replacement cost of the assets, including the associated infrastructure you're buying is on a 100% ownership basis,
meaning you're in their part?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
I think -- and I'm going to give you a very kind of round number here or round range. My sense is that a really well-executed project that is low cost,
relatively speaking, with -- including the utilities and the infrastructure, likely close to $6 billion for a well-executed project, 100% basis. So half of
it would be about $3 billion.

Operator
Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Chemical Analyst
Just a quick question to help us with the cash flow from this, maybe like the first 3 years. So you talked about there won't be any interest because
there's no debt. But what would the CapEx look like the first couple of years? Will you want to make some tweaks that maybe would indicate more
CapEx than normal for a new project?

How much working capital will you need cash to put into? And then is there any reason to think that the taxes on this will be different than U.S.
corporate taxes?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Good questions. So first of all, in terms of CapEx, we do not intend to do anything unusual in terms of CapEx. It'll just be a little bit of maintenance
capital. But as you know, I mean, these are new facilities so should not require much CapEx at all.

On interest expense. I mean there will be some interest expense incrementally because we will borrow partly to fund. But at today's rates, it's very
low in terms of interest expense. There could be some tax benefits for next year that we're thinking through. Don't have anything really firm to
discuss today, but we'll work our way through that.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Duffy, my sense is that, as I mentioned earlier, I think well within the first year, we're going to see positive cash flow. It's going to be by midyear,
hopefully, even sooner than that. There's not a lot of integration work to do here. It's a single asset, where we don't intend to have kind of incremental
costs or be a little bit of kind of cost to achieve in synergies.

But it's nothing like what we've talked about on A. Schulman, right, which was a global company that we acquired. This is a single-asset deal in a
way. The size turns out to be very similar in terms of value. So I expect that we'll be contributing cash -- this JV will be contributing cash flow for a
good bit of 2021.

Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Chemical Analyst
Perfect. And then can you walk through, maybe big picture, what are the contractual obligations with the other Sasol assets that sit on the site in
your JV?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. I mean there will be -- we'll supply some utilities here and there. But for the most part, they're separate. We were -- the cracker and the 2
polyethylene plants are really segregated because they were built new. There'll be some small, I mean, utility-type agreements back to Sasol at the
site.

Our last question comes from John Roberts with UBS.

Matthew Stephen Skowronski - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Analyst
This is Matt Skowronski on for John. You said you think of the historical margins as the ones we saw the last 3 years. I imagine this deal shows your
confidence in ethane advantage longer term, but what's your view of ethane in the near-term and maybe over the next 3 years?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Good question. And on ethane, I mean, I think you've seen some of the price volatility recently. With some supply off-line, we've seen ethane
come back off again. Likely, I think we've kind of chopped around in the range where we've been recently. And as oil prices recover and a few rigs
come back in the Permian, maybe it's not until the second half of next year. But I think, given that sort of modest outlook for supply, there's enough
ethane to supply the crackers that are here on the Gulf Coast and more -- and the exports that are already committed, if you will.

And your broader question about feedstock advantage, the way I've kind of thought about this is that it's unlikely that the feedstock advantage
goes back to what it was back in '14, when we had oil-to-gas ratio of like 40 and 50. But I do think that we can see oil-to-gas ratio in the 20s very
consistently. That provides significant advantage for assets that are already on the ground, but it may make challenging new investments that
looked a lot better when oil-to-gas was 40 to 50 instead of mid-20s. So to be clear, with the mid-20s kind of oil-to-gas, I feel quite good about the
cash flow generation capability of the assets that we have on the ground, including now our JV with Sasol.

All right. So that was the last question. Well, thank you very much for joining us on such short notice. And we look forward to engaging with all of
you further and answering your questions. Hope you have a great day and a great weekend. Thank you.

OVERVIEW
On 10/02/20, Co. announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to form 50/50 JV with Sasol through which LYB will
purchase 50% interest in the newly-built ethylene cracker, two polyethylene units and associated utilities and infrastructure located
in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for $2b.

FINANCIAL DATA
   A. Purchase price = $2b.

PRESENTATION SUMMARY
I. TRANSACTION REVIEW (B.P.)

   A. Sasol JV:
      1. On 10/02/20, announced completion of definitive agreements to form new JV with Sasol.
        a. Transaction builds upon measured strategic approach LYB has been taking to position Co. for the future.
        b. Deal offers a unique opportunity to grow one of the core areas of Co.'s business by investing in new, already-operating,
           high-quality assets that have tremendous upside as market conditions continue to improve.
      2. Recognizes this announcement might come as a surprise after Co. continued to pursue highly-disciplined financial strategy
         focused on maximizing liquidity during first six months of the pandemic.
        a. Believes this JV uniquely fulfills all of the highly-selective criteria Co. outlined for identifying and capturing value-minded
           inorganic growth during industry cycles.
      3. Believes this acquisition will place LYB in a stronger position as the economy recovers and Co.'s industry returns to normalized
         volumes and earnings.
      4. Co. will purchase 50% interest in the newly-built ethylene cracker, two polyethylene units and associated utilities and
         infrastructure located in Lake Charles, Louisiana for $2b.
        a. Will operate assets on behalf of both partners for JV.

                                                                                                                                                                             
             b. JV enables both partners to maximize value of these world-class assets while advancing respective strategic objectives.
          5. Expects to be able to obtain customary approvals and close transaction before this calendar year-end.
            a. While agreements do not set out a formal process, Co. has the potential to acquire JV assets in full at some point in future.
          6. Acquisition has much in common with integrated cracker JV that Co. established and started up with Bora in China just a
             few weeks ago.
            a. When two JVs are taken together, essentially acquiring the full capacity and immediate financial benefits of a new and
                operational world-scale integrated cracker complex with minimal exposure to the risk from project execution, timing
                uncertainty, and opportunity costs that are typically incurred during the multi-year construction of these facilities.
            b. Acquiring this world-scale integrated cracker at a very attractive valuation.
            c. Not placing a big bet by building a project that depends upon a single geographic market for feedstock position.
               i. Between Bora JV and transaction with Sasol, expects profitable return shortly after closing with half of the capacity in
                  the world's fastest-growing market and the other half benefiting from some of the world's lowest feedstock costs.
          7. Lake Charles JV's integrated polyethylene business is at the core of the largest value chain in Co.'s portfolio and will serve
             to increase the extent of its global production, arising from advantaged low-cost North American feedstocks.
            a. Believes that Co.'s share of JV will generate approx. $50m in synergies for LYB over the next few years.
            b. Both partners believe the value of these assets will be enhanced by leveraging Co.'s global operational experience and
                know-how, which will encompass over 17m tons of annual olefin capacity and 16m tons of polyolefin capacity upon
                completion of this transaction.
   B. Assets:
      1. Co.'s diligence confirm the assets are well-built with scale, technologies and feedstock advantage required to succeed in
         the global market.
      2. Partners identified quick, low-cost opportunities to debottleneck capacity that will enable JV to capture synergies.
      3. Believes that Co.'s knowledge and experience in operating similar facilities provide opportunities to increase utilization by
         improving operational uptime.
      4. JV's low-density and linear low-density polyethylene capacity complements Co.'s existing North American capacity, which
         is predominantly high-density polyethylene.
      5. While it might be unlikely that integrated polyethylene margins will soon return to the high levels Co. saw in 2015, believes
         JV is well-positioned to capture cyclical upside over the coming years.
   C. JV Contributions:
      1. Believes that Co.'s partner and Lake Charles employees are well-aligned with LYB's fundamental focus on safety.
        a. Cascades benefits through:
            i. Reliable operations.
           ii. Reduced waste to the environment.
          iii. Superior financial performance.
      2. JV will also benefit from:
        a. Implementing the best practices identified by Co.'s benchmarking.
        b. Continuous improvement initiatives across global system of 13 ethylene crackers and dozens of polyethylene production
             lines.
      3. Global innovation capabilities will serve to further enhance value creation from these assets.
   D. Capital Allocation:
      1. Transaction is consistent with Co.'s commitments to:
        a. Disciplined capital allocation.
        b. Investment-grade credit rating.
      2. Has no intention to begin building a new integrated ethylene cracker in North America for the foreseeable future.
        a. Making deep value investments in recently-built existing capacity without the risk that frequently hampers returns from
            capital-intensive projects.
           i. Investments will provide returns within the first months instead of a distant future.
      3. JV:

                                                                                                                                                                             
             a. Expected to provide an unlevered internal rate of return in mid-teens.
            b. Expected to be accretive to EPS and cash flow within one year, exceeding value-minded thresholds for investment.
            c. Expects to fund acquisition with combination of debt and cash on balance sheet.
          4. Believes that Co. can continue to largely fund dividend with cash from operating activities over the coming year.
          5. As Co. prioritizes deleveraging over share buybacks and grows earnings following transaction, should rapidly improve credit
             metrics to ranges that are consistent with a solid investment-grade rating.
   E. Key Takeaways:
      1. Making a deep value investment in leading assets during trough conditions where Co. believes there is significant opportunity
         for cyclical upside.
        a. Leveraging advantaged positions to maximize JV returns for both partners.
      2. Remains steadfast to disciplined capital allocation principles with dual focus on maintaining dividend and Co.'s commitment
         to an investment-grade rating.
      3. JV announcement on 10/02/20 represents another measured approach to extend one of Co.'s core businesses and increase
         free cash flow.
      4. Over the next three years, looks forward to new sources of annual recurring EBITDA as Co. harvests fruits of its recent growth
         investments.
        a. Additional EBITDA will come from:
            i. Over $200m in annual synergies from A. Schulman acquisition.
           ii. $180-200m in annual estimated EBITDA from Co.'s capacity to produce targeted product slate at new Hyperzone
               polyethylene plant, based on historical margins.
          iii. Initial returns from Chinese JV with Bora and Sinopec, and JV on 10/02/20 in Louisiana with Sasol.
          iv. $400-450m in annual estimated EBITDA in 2023 from capacity at new PO/TBA plant, based on historical margins.
        b. End result is over $1b of incremental EBITDA from recent growth investments.
        c. Expects substantial additional EBITDA improvement as margins normalize and volumes recover from the depths of the
             pandemic across Co.'s existing asset footprint, particularly in value chains that serve transportation fuels and automotive
             manufacturing.
      5. When combined with Co.'s aggressive management of working capital, incremental cost-saving initiatives and reductions
         in CapEx, believes LYB is well-positioned to increase free cash flow.
        a. Will continue highly-disciplined approach to capital deployment.
        b. Additional free cash flow will initially be directed towards deleveraging balance sheet, followed by strengthening capital
             returns for shareholders.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.

Jeffrey John Zekauskas - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Two questions. The first is what's the level of leverage of the joint venture at its inception? And what might be the likely leverage of
-- leverage ratio of the joint venture over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
So Jeff, this is equity finance so there's no joint venture-level debt. We will take on debt at our level -- at the LyondellBasell corporate
level.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jeffrey John Zekauskas - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And with the 300 kilotons of excess ethylene beyond the polyethylene that you'll pick up, are there any constraints on the sale
of that ethylene for you? That is, do you have to sell it at a cost-plus basis back to Sasol or some other entity? Or are you unconstrained?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, we presume that, as what occurs with other merchant sales, there's probably a combination of market-based and cost-based
sort of sales. I think, Jeff, what we're -- where we potentially can create more value with those pounds is that we have a very strong
network in terms of pipelines on both -- like on the Texas side, if you will, of the Gulf Coast. And now with the network and some
connectivity that will get through this transaction, we'll be able to sell ethylene in both Louisiana and in Texas directly.

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
But just to be clear, Jeff, it's -- each partners are encumbered. It's essentially a tolling JV rather than something more complicated.

Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.

Steve Byrne - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director of Equity Research
It's our understanding that Sasol had planned to push at least 2/3 of the polyethylene from this complex into the U.S. market. What
will you guys do with that net increase in production?

And is it possible you would export more out of the Houston Ship Channel and move some of this more into the U.S.? But basically,
what's the net effect? Is it likely to reduce the risk of putting pressure on premium price in the U.S.?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. So the plan is for LyondellBasell to market 100% of the product -- of the polyethylene and -- LDP and LLDP. And our plan, Steve,
is to plug that into our global network. And the idea is to maximize value wherever we can do that.

So -- and as you know, we sell directly in many parts of Asia. We don't have LL capacity in Europe, so we could potentially supplement
through sales through Europe. So I think that's one of the other values we bring to this venture is a global marketing network that
sells directly in most of the major markets.

Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Arun Shankar Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Congratulations on the transaction. I guess I did want to dig a little deeper on the strategic rationale here. I guess our perception
was that Lyondell was potentially moving a little bit more into -- LyondellBasell into harvest mode, and yet you have made some
significant investments here with the Bora JV and this one with Sasol.

And I guess we do understand that, effectively, you're making lower-risk investments here later in the production process and so, I
guess, effectively adding about a cracker's worth of production. So I guess is it just a great value for you? Or again, maybe that $2
billion could have been redirected towards capital return or deleveraging a little bit sooner? How did you kind of get to this position
that this was absolutely essential at this point?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Thank you, Arun. That's a good question. So some of the things I'm going to repeat back to you, what you said, which is that's
certainly lower risk. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, both projects, essentially, were running at the time we put the equity
in. Certainly, Sasol, the JV is running. And Bora was ramping up at the time.

I think, really, what this does is it strengthens our core business. We're able to be opportunistic and strengthen our core business.
The cyclical upside that I highlighted, we think, is a big driver in terms of why do this as opposed to delever or do buybacks. We think
it's just a unique opportunity to acquire world-scale new assets in both JVs, frankly. And in the case of the Bora JV, remember, that's
1/3 equity, 2/3 debt. So our capital or equity required there was a lot less.

The other thing I really like about both of these ventures is that, in one case, we're leveraging low-cost feedstocks; in the other, we're
producing in the fastest-growing market in the world. So it's kind of a -- we're not just betting on one thing here. We're doing both.
And I think in the case of our Bora investment, it will really give us far better insights into the market in China. And remember, for
that project, all of the production will stay in China. So our intention is not to re-export any of that.

And lastly, we think all of this kind of positions us for higher returns, especially when you think through newbuild costs versus what
we paid in both, frankly, and then the cyclical upside that still lies ahead. So we really saw these as unique opportunities, strengthen
the core, right time in the cycle, low risk.

Arun Shankar Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
And sorry, if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Some of those numbers you gave, I guess when you say historical margins, are you
-- which period are you referring to? I guess is that like the '14 through '19 period? Or maybe a little bit longer? Or how should we
think about how to frame the benefit from this?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
I wouldn't go all the way back to '14 because we don't think oil prices are going to get back to those kind of levels. Think about the
last 3 years. That's really how we think about historical margins.

Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
Congratulations, Bob.

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Thanks, Kevin.

Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
Can you tell us about the option that you have to acquire the balance of the 50% ownership to achieve full ownership in these assets
over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, so Kevin, it's not formulaically kind of hardwired into the agreements. But the partners have an understanding that, over a
period of time, Sasol have indicated that they would focus on other derivatives at the site. And doing 100% of the marketing and
operating the site positions us to take that next step at the right time when both partners are ready. So I think that's probably the
firmest indication of the next step is that, essentially, we're operating and marketing.

Kevin William McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC - Partner
I see. And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about the specific sources of the $50 million in synergies that you envision and how
that might flow through over time?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Kevin, a lot of that is just increasing the uptime and really kind of running closer to nameplate capacity through our experience
with running multiple units around the world, whether it's crackers or polyethylene assets, and then, secondly, thinking through
value on the marketing side by marketing directly through our network globally.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.

David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst
Congrats on the deal, Bob. Bob, how much new debt do you expect to issue in conjunction with this transaction?

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. It's Michael. So I mean just a couple of things I'd point out. So we ended the second quarter with liquidity of almost $6 billion.
And then we ended the second quarter with cash of just over $3 billion.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 It would be our intention in the not-so-distant future to finance this asset, probably a little bit of cash and the majority of it being
debt. And then we'd probably take that opportunity to do some refinancing of some of our near-term maturities as well.

David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst
Good. And Michael, how will this JV be accounted for, consolidated or equity?

Michael C. McMurray - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So it's going to be accounted for essentially very similar to our PO JV in Europe. It won't be consolidated, so equity accounting,
but we will be able to record our proportional share of both revenue and EBITDA.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate
This is Angel Castillo on for Vincent. Just a quick question, a follow-up on your investments. Are there any other assets out there that
you're considering or, in terms of potential future acquisitions, that would continue to expand on this strategy of kind of acquiring
things that are further down the construction path? Or should we assume that you're kind of done with M&A or investments at this
point?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Angel, we don't really see any other assets that are like this that have the kind of strategic rationale that I laid out. So our focus now
is going to be to get to closing as quickly as possible, get the rates to where we want, get a solid marketing plan in place. And as I
mentioned, we're coming into a period as a company where we're going to harvest the value from these investments we've been
making over the past 5 years.

So I'm looking forward to riding kind of the cyclical upside here with more assets than we had going into the pandemic. So -- and
the cash flow, again, our aim is to delever, first and foremost and get to a solid investment-grade rating. And we think there's still
going to be opportunity to do buybacks a couple of years down the road.

Angel Octavio Castillo Malpica - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate
Understood. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on this asset. What's the cost basis of assets that are going to be included in
the JV as opposed to the full project's cost?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
No. It would be our acquisition costs essentially is what we bring across. So I think if you're asking me if there's some kind of write-down
associated with our acquisition, that would not be on our side.

Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.

Prashant N. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Global Head of Chemicals & Agriculture Research and MD
Yes. I have a follow-up question on a previous question and then I have another question. Just quickly on this, your option to acquire
the entire joint venture, is there a trigger for that? Is that your option? Or is that Sasol's option?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, as I've mentioned earlier, it's not hardwired, but it's sort of the intent of the parties. And I think what sets us up for that is that
we're essentially the marketer and the operator. So it's something -- it's a principle that we've aligned around -- between the 2
partners.

Prashant N. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Global Head of Chemicals & Agriculture Research and MD
Okay. And your deal -- this deal may be opportunistic. But how should we think about Lyondell staying upstream in commodities
versus going downstream into specialties? Because based on your Schulman acquisition, some people thought that you might be
going downstream. So can you just give us your thoughts about how do you think about that?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Sure. So I think of Schulman as an extension of the value chains that we participate in today. And you'll remember that when we
acquired A. Schulman, we essentially doubled the existing compounding business. At the time, we had about $200 million of EBITDA
in our base business. We acquired $200 million of compounding EBITDA from Schulman. And then we put in about $175 million on
Catalloy and polybutene-1 to comprise what we call today the APS segment.

So I don't -- P.J., I don't think about that as a specialty versus commodity. I think about it as value chain. And I think about sort of a
differentiated commodity or differentiation and participation closer to end users with our compounding business. But I don't look
for us to do a lot in real specialties. That's really not our business. We'll stay within the value chains where we participate today.

And going as far as downstream as compounding makes a ton of sense for us because we make the base resins in polyethylene,
polypropylene. We have the technology. We have the olefins. We make the catalyst for the polyolefins. So if you think about integration,
it makes a lot of sense, and our ability, in the case of compounding, to be able to bring innovative solutions to the market quickly
because we also make the base resin.

Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.

Michael Joseph Sison - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
This is a -- it's a big investment during uncertain times. I'm just curious, is there -- and you must have improved confidence, I guess,
that the industry can get back to better profitability over the next couple of years. So anything in particular you're seeing near term
that gives you confidence that we can get back to those margins over time?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Sure. So as I mentioned in one of the previous questions, I'm not implying here that we get back to 2014 kind of margins. But I think
getting to -- over the past 3 years, in '17, '18, '19, over the next 3 to 5 years, very doable.

So first of all, if you look at how polyethylene demand has developed here during the pandemic, we actually see year-over-year
demand growth globally. We see year-over-year demand growth in the U.S., and we see year-over-year demand growth back to
almost normal in China. So demand growth in China year-to-date through August has grown something like 4% to 5%. U.S. is 1.5%
kind of range, year-over-year growth. So almost 2%.

So -- and also on the supply side, Mike, we're starting to see delays, cancellations, partly because of visibility on oil price, partly
because of financial wherewithal of those who might want to build. So I've been through a lot of cycles over the 30-some years --
30-plus years that I've been in the business, and this is kind of how cycles work. And I think what's key is that you pay or have valuations
at the bottom of the cycle that reflect the bottom of the cycle. And I think, in a way, we've been able to achieve that.

And really high-quality assets that we're going to participate in here, great partner. We're looking forward to working with Sasol.
And I think, together, both Sasol and ourselves can ride the cyclical upside with world-scale assets.

Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.

Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
I have 45 questions, but I might settle for the top 2 or so. So I was wondering...

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
You can ask me one now and the other 44 to Dave later.

Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
I blame the pandemic. So I was wondering, you're already quite long in ethylene. And with this deal, you're getting longer still. Does
this change your strategic thinking about your ethylene position? And should we expect some derivative units being built soon?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. So first of all, Jonas, after the start of our Hyperzone plant, or about 500,000 tons long before this deal, so if you add another
300,000, we end up at 800,000, which gets us to under 2 billion, roughly, in terms of pounds of ethylene in the U.S. We've been kind
of in the 1 to 2 range for a few years now. And I don't think that's too long.

We have a very extensive pipeline network, many long-standing relationships. Sasol selling some of that ethylene today. So I think
it's still modest. When you think about our overall portfolio and percent merchant position, on a percent basis, it's still quite low.

And your second question about would we consider building more derivative units. Not now, but in time, perhaps. I think we need
to see how the business develops, how operating rates develop over the next 3, 4 years. But that could be a middle-of-the-decade

                                                                                                                                                                             
 or second-half-of-the-decade sort of decision. But to be clear, I do not anticipate us doing anything on derivatives in the next 3 to 4
years. We will maintain this net long position, and we think it's very manageable.

Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.

Matthew Robert Lovseth Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD of Refining and Chemicals
Research
So it was reported there were other parties interested, and it looks like you got a pretty good deal to us. Does this just simply come
down to who had the highest bid? Or were there some nonmonetary considerations that helped you win out?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Well, I mean, it's always hard to gauge competitive dynamics, and I don't want to speculate on a call like this. But I think, for us, what
I hope our partners saw was the value that we brought from an operating and marketing standpoint, ability to plug into a global
network on marketing immediately from day 1, and the possibility for them to retain 50% and ride some of the market upside before
they made a decision on the second 50%. So that's kind of what I hope and know. The remaining competitive dynamics, it's difficult
to really say.

Operator
Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Atlantic Global (sic) [Alembic Global].

Hassan Ijaz Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors - Partner & Head of Research
Bob, a question on valuation. If I take a look at greenfield replacement value of most of the projects that came onstream in the U.S.
over the last couple of years, on a sort of replacement value basis, you guys seem to be sort of purchasing these assets at a significant
discount relative to those replacement values.

So the question really is, does that just highlight what a good deal you guys have gotten? Or have you seen a meaningful sort of
decline in newbuild sort of replacement values as sort of the E&C side of the business has slackened a bit with sort of the flurry of
newbuilds slowing down?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Hassan, it's a great question. It is not an indication of lower costs on the newbuild side. I think it's more reflective of the cycle
and kind of where we are in the cycle today. So as I mentioned in my earlier remarks on one of the other questions is that it's
opportunistic. But I do think that we're kind of at the bottom of the polyethylene cycle.

And as there have been many public announcements about delays or cancellation of projects on the supply side and on the demand
side, we're really seeing good growth even through a pandemic. And with the recovery, we might even see a year of above kind of
average growth. We think that the cycle should turn up here, and I think it's just timing in terms of where we are in the cycle and the
ability to get this done at this time.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Roger Spitz with Bank of America.

Roger Neil Spitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director and High Yield Research Analyst
What do you estimate the replacement cost of the assets, including the associated infrastructure you're buying is on a 100% ownership
basis, meaning you're in their part?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
I think -- and I'm going to give you a very kind of round number here or round range. My sense is that a really well-executed project
that is low cost, relatively speaking, with -- including the utilities and the infrastructure, likely close to $6 billion for a well-executed
project, 100% basis. So half of it would be about $3 billion.

Operator
Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.

Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Chemical Analyst
Just a quick question to help us with the cash flow from this, maybe like the first 3 years. So you talked about there won't be any
interest because there's no debt. But what would the CapEx look like the first couple of years? Will you want to make some tweaks
that maybe would indicate more CapEx than normal for a new project?

How much working capital will you need cash to put into? And then is there any reason to think that the taxes on this will be different
than U.S. corporate taxes?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Good questions. So first of all, in terms of CapEx, we do not intend to do anything unusual in terms of CapEx. It'll just be a little
bit of maintenance capital. But as you know, I mean, these are new facilities so should not require much CapEx at all.

On interest expense. I mean there will be some interest expense incrementally because we will borrow partly to fund. But at today's
rates, it's very low in terms of interest expense. There could be some tax benefits for next year that we're thinking through. Don't
have anything really firm to discuss today, but we'll work our way through that.

Duffy, my sense is that, as I mentioned earlier, I think well within the first year, we're going to see positive cash flow. It's going to be
by midyear, hopefully, even sooner than that. There's not a lot of integration work to do here. It's a single asset, where we don't
intend to have kind of incremental costs or be a little bit of kind of cost to achieve in synergies.

But it's nothing like what we've talked about on A. Schulman, right, which was a global company that we acquired. This is a single-asset
deal in a way. The size turns out to be very similar in terms of value. So I expect that we'll be contributing cash -- this JV will be
contributing cash flow for a good bit of 2021.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Chemical Analyst
Perfect. And then can you walk through, maybe big picture, what are the contractual obligations with the other Sasol assets that sit
on the site in your JV?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. I mean there will be -- we'll supply some utilities here and there. But for the most part, they're separate. We were -- the cracker
and the 2 polyethylene plants are really segregated because they were built new. There'll be some small, I mean, utility-type
agreements back to Sasol at the site.

Operator
Our last question comes from John Roberts with UBS.

Matthew Stephen Skowronski - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Analyst
This is Matt Skowronski on for John. You said you think of the historical margins as the ones we saw the last 3 years. I imagine this
deal shows your confidence in ethane advantage longer term, but what's your view of ethane in the near-term and maybe over the
next 3 years?

Bhavesh V. Patel - LyondellBasell Industries N.V. - CEO & Director
Yes. Good question. And on ethane, I mean, I think you've seen some of the price volatility recently. With some supply off-line, we've
seen ethane come back off again. Likely, I think we've kind of chopped around in the range where we've been recently. And as oil
prices recover and a few rigs come back in the Permian, maybe it's not until the second half of next year. But I think, given that sort
of modest outlook for supply, there's enough ethane to supply the crackers that are here on the Gulf Coast and more -- and the
exports that are already committed, if you will.

And your broader question about feedstock advantage, the way I've kind of thought about this is that it's unlikely that the feedstock
advantage goes back to what it was back in '14, when we had oil-to-gas ratio of like 40 and 50. But I do think that we can see oil-to-gas
ratio in the 20s very consistently. That provides significant advantage for assets that are already on the ground, but it may make
challenging new investments that looked a lot better when oil-to-gas was 40 to 50 instead of mid-20s. So to be clear, with the mid-20s
kind of oil-to-gas, I feel quite good about the cash flow generation capability of the assets that we have on the ground, including
now our JV with Sasol.

All right. So that was the last question. Well, thank you very much for joining us on such short notice. And we look forward to engaging
with all of you further and answering your questions. Hope you have a great day and a great weekend. Thank you.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Acceleron STELLAR Phase III Trial Design Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to hand the call over to Ms. Jamie Bernard, Associate Director of Investor Relations at Acceleron. Please go ahead.

Jamie A. Bernard - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Associate Director of IR
Thank you and welcome, everyone, to the Acceleron investor and analyst webinar to discuss the design of the Phase III STELLAR trial of sotatercept
in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The presentation for this webcast is available on the Investors & Media page of our corporate website at www.acceleronpharma.com.

As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our regulatory and product development plans and research and
commercialization activities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to materially differ from those
forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K on file with the SEC.

We are delighted to have the STELLAR trial's principal investigator, Dr. Marius Hoeper, joining us for today's call. Dr. Hoeper is a professor and senior
physician in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Head of the pulmonary hypertension program and attending physician at the intensive care
unit, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In addition, members of our Acceleron management team are here with me today, including Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Jay
Backstrom, our Head of Research and Development; Sujay Kango, our Chief Commercial Officer; Dr. Janethe Pena, our Vice President, Pulmonary
Medical Research; and Todd James, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Investor Relations.

After the presentation, we look forward to answering your questions.

I would now like to turn the call over to Habib Dable, our Chief Executive Officer.

Habib J. Dable - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's webinar on the STELLAR trial design. First of all, I'd like to hope
-- and hope that everyone is safe and well.

I could not be happier with the progress and the flawless execution from our team especially given the many challenges we are all managing in
the current COVID-19 environment. Beginning with the PULSAR top line readout at the beginning of the year, 2020 has been an amazing year for
sotatercept in PAH and for Acceleron.

In the middle of the year, we provided a detailed presentation of the top line Phase II PULSAR results during the Breaking News session at the
American Thoracic Society's 2020 virtual meeting. The presentation was anchored by Dr. David Badesch, the PULSAR trial's principal investigator
at the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute's Drug Discovery & Development Symposium 2020 digital meeting. And Janethe will provide a brief
summary on the PULSAR results in just a few minutes.

As you may recall, sotatercept was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA and Priority Medicines or PRIME designation by the
EMA. Not only is this a first for an Acceleron-discovered medicine, but sotatercept is the first and only therapeutic candidate in PAH to receive these
designations.

We've already benefited from the designation through our interactions with 2 agencies, allowing us to finalize and advance our Phase III development
plan for sotatercept, starting with the registrational Phase III STELLAR trial. And I would like to thank Dr. Hoeper for -- the STELLAR trial's principal
investigator, for joining us today to highlight both the existing high unmet need in PAH and the STELLAR trial's design.

Additionally, we continue to expand the body of preclinical evidence supporting sotatercept's potential in this life-threatening disease. In May,
preclinical research describing the underlying biology behind sotatercept's effects in models of PAH were published in the journal Science
Translational Medicine.

Most recently, our team presented new preclinical results just last month at the European Respiratory Society's International Congress 2020 virtual.
The presentation highlighted improvements of both pulmonary and cardiac parameters in 2 preclinical models.

This significant progress, along with the substantial unmet medical need that still exists in PAH, further validates and strengthens the potential of
our long-term vision for sotatercept as a backbone therapy in the future treatment paradigm of PAH across all stages of the disease. And Jay will
touch on the broader development later in the presentation.

I will now turn the call over to Dr. Janethe Pena, Vice President of Pulmonary Medical Research. Dr. Pena is responsible for all sotatercept clinical
development activities. She joined our team just over 2 years ago to manage the Phase II PULSAR and SPECTRA trials. And prior to joining Acceleron,
Janethe led the clinical development of Adempas in PAH at Bayer. I am very happy to have her as part of our team.

Janethe, please go ahead.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Janethe Pena - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - VP of Medical Research & Pulmonary
Thank you, Habib. It has been a pleasure to work on sotatercept's development in PAH. Before I hand the presentation over to Dr. Hoeper to discuss
STELLAR, I would like to briefly review the results of PULSAR as it is the basis for the STELLAR trial, and the results give us high confidence in our
potential future success in PAH.

As many of you are familiar, PULSAR is a robust, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial. The key inclusion criteria included
patients in WHO Group 1 PAH who were WHO NYHA functional class II or III, had a baseline pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, of greater than
or equal to 5 Wood units, a baseline 6-minute walk distance of 150 to 550 meters, and were on stable PAH background therapy that included mono,
double or triple therapies.

In total, 106 patients were randomized 3:3:4 to either placebo, sotatercept 0.3 or 0.7 milligrams per kilogram, with all cohorts also receiving standard
PAH background therapy. The primary treatment was 24 weeks, and the trial is currently in its 18-month open-label extension phase, where the
placebo patients were re-randomized 1:1 to 1 of the 2 sotatercept dose levels. As of mid-September, 94 of the 97 patients that rolled into that
extension study remained on trial.

Turning to the baseline characteristics. For the 106 patients enrolled in PULSAR, 58% had idiopathic PAH. And based on the stratification by
functional class built into PULSAR, there was almost an equal representation between patients with functional class II and class III. 50% of the
patients were on triple background therapy, 35% were in double, and 9% were on monotherapy. As expected, the majority of patients were female,
about 87%, mean age was 48 years, and the mean time since diagnosis was 7.4 years. The mean PVR was 779 dyn, 6-minute walk distance was 398
meters, and the NT-proBNP was 908 picograms per ml.

The primary endpoint in PULSAR was changed from baseline in PVR to week 24. PULSAR achieved its primary endpoint with a statistically significant
mean reduction in PVR. Patients on stable background therapies who were treated with 0.3 or 0.7 milligrams per kilogram of sotatercept experienced
mean PVR reductions of approximately 21% and 34%, respectively.

The key secondary endpoint was changed from baseline in 6-minute walk distance to week 24. The trial also achieved a statistically significant
all-dose mean improvement from baseline of 54 meters in the key secondary endpoint of 6-minute walk distance and a placebo-corrected
improvement of 25 meters.

The PULSAR trials evaluated several exploratory analyses. The results were concordant across multiple exploratory endpoints at week 24, including:
NT-proBNP, which is a biomarker for heart health, achieved a 51% improvement; pulmonary arterial pressure achieved a mean absolute change
of 10.5 millimeters mercury; and a multicomponent endpoint improvement evaluating 3 criteria that Dr. Hoeper will describe a little bit later today.

In terms of safety, treatment-emergent adverse events were similarly distributed in all groups. Serious adverse events were more common at the
0.7 milligram per kg dose of sotatercept, but they were mostly unrelated to study drug and did not lead to discontinuation in the study.

In conclusion, PULSAR achieved significant improvement in its primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints. Results favored sotatercept plus
PAH background therapy at both dose levels and in patients receiving mono, double or triple therapy. Sotatercept was generally well tolerated in
the patients with PAH. The PULSAR results established a proof-of-concept and a significant confidence in our global Phase III registration trial called
STELLAR.

And with that, I am very, very pleased to have Dr. Marius Hoeper joining us this morning to provide an overview of the STELLAR trial design. Professor
Hoeper is the Acting Director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hannover Medical School in Germany, in charge of the pulmonary
hypertension program there and senior attending physician at the intensive care unit, having published over 350 papers in these areas.

Professor Hoeper is a task force member and a chair at 3rd, 4th, 5th and the 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension. He's also the author

He's on our Steering Committee and an active investigator for PULSAR. We are now happy to have him as the principal investigator for STELLAR.

Marius, please begin.

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Thank you very much, Janethe, and hello, everybody.

As Janethe mentioned, I'm a respiratory physician working here in Hannover, Germany, at Hannover Medical School, which harbors one of the
largest pulmonary hypertension programs in the world. We are actively taking care of about 1,000 patients right now. And we've been working on
pulmonary hypertension for almost 30 years now, so quite a long time.

And over the years, when I started, we had no treatment whatsoever available for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In fact, I started with my doctoral
thesis on lung transplantation, which was the first and only thing that we had for several years. And then we had a couple of breakthroughs
especially, of course, intravenous prostacyclins; and then later bosentan, the first endothelin receptor antagonist; and then sildenafil, the first PDE5
inhibitors. But these were the 3 main breakthroughs we had. And the last one was -- sildenafil, was, if I remember correctly, in 2004. And since then,
of course, we had further developments, combination therapies and so on. But we have had a bit of a standstill.

And the drugs that we have are great. I mean, again, coming from an area where we had no drug available whatsoever, having these drugs made
a big difference. We improved hemodynamics. We improved the quantity of life, the patient exercise capacity and certainly also the patient survival.

But when we now move to Slide 16, we also have quite serious limitations of our current treatment options for patients with PAH. First of all, we
still don't have a cure. And the long-term survival of patients despite optimized treatment remains limited, and the majority of patients don't reach
treatment goals.

Treatment goal has been defined by the latest European Pulmonary Hypertension Guidelines published in 2015, and this is reaching a low-risk
profile. A low-risk profile is associated with patients' well-being and good exercise capacity and good long-term survival.

But shown here as an example, just 2 large registries from Europe. One is called COMPERA, mostly from German centers. The other is the French
registry. And what both of these registries show is that only a minority of the patients do reach this treatment goal of a low-risk profile. So it's about
20% and 30%. And again, I've shown you data from U.S. where it's quite similar.

So even with the treatments that we have, and this includes double, triple combination therapies, including intravenous prostacyclins, the vast
majority of these patients do not reach their treatment goals. They're not at low risk. So they still have a limited quality of life, and they still have a
limited life expectancy. And the annual mortality rates remain at about 7% per year. So there's clearly, clearly much room for improvement in the
field.

And here comes sotatercept in place. So when we move to Slide 17, without going too much here in basic and translational and science, but what
we have here is a novel mechanism of action with the potential, and I think this is the fundamental issue here, of reversing pulmonary vascular
remodeling.

All the drugs that we have so far are mainly pulmonary related. And they have some anti-remodeling effects, but true reverse pulmonary vascular
remodeling is probably something we haven't achieved yet. And again, we started 20 years ago when there was the first description of genes
responsible for familial forms of pulmonary hypertension, which was the BMPR2 mutation. And this lead -- led to a whole bunch of research activities
in centers throughout the world identifying eventually the mechanisms involved in pulmonary vascular remodeling, especially the proliferation
of endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And the paper that was mentioned earlier that was published this year in Science Translational Medicine showed very nicely that in preclinical
models of pulmonary hypertension, sotatercept does not only stop pulmonary vascular remodeling but at least in these animal models, has the
potential on fully reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling not only by bringing back the mean pulmonary arterial pressures to normal but also,
when you look at the histology specimens, to make the vessels look normal again. And the key mechanism may or may not here be induction of
apoptosis.

So pulmonary vascular remodeling is really -- it's a proliferate disease. You have the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, of endothelial cells. So
once this has been established, and it has been established when you see the patient because they have extensive pulmonary vascular remodeling
at the time of diagnosis, the only way really to get towards a direction that comes or may come close to a cure is to induce reverse remodeling.
And this could be done by inducing apoptosis of the cells, of the lumen so that the lumen of the vessels reopens again. And here at least, there's
a clear signal from the preclinical models that this is something that's happening with sotatercept.

The challenge now is to translate this into clinical trials. You know the FDA, you know the European agencies, they want the famous feel, function,
survive. So they wanted the patients to feel better, to function better and hopefully also to live longer. And what PULSAR has already shown, and
Janethe mentioned it very nicely earlier, is hemodynamic improvement. But hemodynamic improvement is something that the agencies do not
want to see. So we have to come up with a concept here how to demonstrate this new mode of action or how to translate this in a clinical trial
design.

And over the past couple of years, and I'm now moving to Slide 18, we have seen data emerging from several large pulmonary hypertension
registries around the world. And what they have shown us very nicely and especially very consistently, that there are several markers, including
several noninvasive markers. So besides hemodynamics, that tells us not only something about the exercise capacity of the patients and right
ventricular strain or right ventricular function but also about the prognosis. And this includes some very basic principles like the functional class
as determined by WHO definition, 6-minute walking distance or biomarkers such as BNP and NT-proBNP. Again, they are all important on its own.
But in the aggregate, they may be even more important. And they will be incorporated in the endpoints that we are going to use in the STELLAR
study program.

So also, from the latest recommendations from the 2015 European guidelines, and this has been updated 2018 at the 6th World Symposium on
Pulmonary Hypertension in Nice, there was a clear focus on the combined use of this variable functional class and 6-minute walk distance and
biomarkers, especially BNP and NT-proBNP, reflecting right ventricular function. So it's a multicomponent assessment that we use.

And let me just go back to the PULSAR study and look at this multicomponent endpoint and patients meeting all 3 criteria: so improvement or
maintenance of functional class or maintaining functional class I and II or improving from functional class III to functional class II; improvement in
NT-proBNP plasma levels by at least 30% from baseline; or improving 6-minute walk distance by at least 30 meters from baseline. And this was
something that was not met in patients receiving placebo plus standard of care. It was seen only in 3% of the patients, as you see in -- on Slide #20,
whereas in the patients receiving sotatercept, this endpoint would have been met in 38% of the patients, so a huge difference that would have
been statistically significant. So this was kind of the backbone of the STELLAR endpoint components here.

So STELLAR is going to be a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of sotatercept versus
placebo. This is on Slide 21. And this is when added to background pulmonary hypertension therapy for the treatment of PAH. So this is one of the
basic concepts here. It's not coming as a stand-alone treatment, and it's going to be used in patients who have established, optimized medical
care.

And STELLAR is going to be one of several Phase III trials. The key inclusion criteria, on Slide 22, will be -- will include adult patients only with WHO
Group 1. So it's pulmonary arterial hypertension patients in functional class II or III. They will have a baseline right heart cath with a PVR of more
than 5 Wood units and a baseline 6-minute walk distance ranging from 150 to 500 meters. They will be, as mentioned earlier, on standard of care
therapies, including mono, double or triple combination therapies, with the drugs that have been approved in various countries for this condition.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The trial scheme for STELLAR is shown on Slide 23. So there will be a screening period of up to 4 weeks, and then patients will be 1:1 randomized
and stratified by WHO functional class and background therapy to receive either placebo or sotatercept as an add-on treatment to their background
therapy.

And the first 24 weeks of the study will be the primary treatment period. Of course, it will be a double-blind period here. And after this, there will
be the primary endpoint analysis, which I will come to in a second.

Then double blind will continue. So there will be a long-term, double-blind treatment period that will be -- last up to 72 weeks, during which we
aim to achieve further safety and efficacy data and especially data on outcomes, including time to clinical worsening.

The primary endpoint, Slide 24, is going to be the change from baseline in 6-minute walk distance at week 24. It's a very conservative endpoint as
we used in several other trials before. It's basically coming from a request here from the regulatory agencies to make this the primary endpoint.

But then when we move to Slide 25, there will be also secondary endpoints, including a key secondary endpoint, and this is going to be the
multicomponent improvement, as discussed earlier. So here really, improvement in functional class or maintaining functional class II, plus
improvement in 6-minute walk distance by at least 30 meters, plus improvement in RV function as reflected by a decline in NT-proBNP by at least
30% from baseline or achieving NT-proBNP level below 300, which is one of the low-risk criteria, as suggested by our current guidelines.

And then, of course, there will be several other secondary endpoints in the study. So we will have hemodynamics again, as imposed; also, a change
of baseline in PVR at week 24; of course, the singular change in NT-proBNP at week 24; change in WHO functional class; and then, of course, quite
importantly, the analysis of time to clinical worsening events.

Slide 27 continues the exploratory endpoints that are quite important here. So echocardiographic measurements of right ventricular function are
going to be quite important here; and also change from baseline in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure at week 24, also quite important.
Remember PULSAR, there was quite significant and substantial decline in the mean pulmonary arterial pressure, again something that stands out
because it's something that we haven't seen with any other PAH treatment so far. And this goes back to the mechanism of action that is quite
intriguing and looking at the potential of reverse remodeling.

And with that, I leave it here. Thank you for your attention. And we'll hand over to Dr. Jay Backstrom, the Head of Research and Development in
Acceleron, for the concluding remarks here. Jay?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Well, thank you, Marius. It's great to have you with us today to review the story of Phase III trial design. And as has been noted at the beginning of
the presentation, it has been a productive year so far for the Acceleron team, and I'm very pleased with the progress we've made to date.

The PULSAR study provides us with the confidence to proceed into a full development program starting with STELLAR and followed shortly by
HYPERION and ZENITH, both aims of the study is establishing sotatercept as early and later intervention strategies, respectively. Together, the
program has the potential to generate data toward our vision of establishing sotatercept as a backbone therapy in PAH.

The priorities for sotatercept are very clear. It is our #1 priority, and we are on track to start the STELLAR study by year-end. And we are working to
complete the open-label extension portion of PULSAR and to complete the SPECTRA study with a plan to share the data from these studies within
the first half of 2021. And finally, we're working to start with HYPERION and ZENITH in the middle of next year.

Near term, we're looking forward to AHA in November, where we plan to present the 24-week ECHO results from the PULSAR trial and where Dr.
Aaron Waxman will present preliminary interim results from SPECTRA. And we remain on track and are aligned and focused on executing the full
development plan for sotatercept.

Now we'd like to open the call up to questions. Operator?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Yaron Werber of Cowen.

Yaron Benjamin Werber - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Biotechnology Analyst
I have a couple of questions. Maybe the first one on the dose, so you're going to start at the 0.3, and you can -- it looks like you can escalate to 0.7.
What constitutes the ability to escalate?

And then you've given us the data in the prior study based on dose. So there's really no discernible difference in 6-minute walk distance by dose.
So it makes sense to go to low dose. But you never broke it out by functional class. Can you just maybe give us whatever you can and how that --
was there a difference between the doses?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Oh, yes, so this is Jay. I mean I'll start. First, with the dose. As you mentioned, as -- even as we talked about these data prior to today's call, I think
we're fortunate, as we think about it, we have 2 active doses. Both 0.3 and 0.7 are active. And as the dynamics favor 0.7, we're really inclined to go
to 0.7. And as we talked about, we do have the opportunity to dose titrate as needed.

So starting with 0.3 really takes advantage of a schedule we actually have in SPECTRA. And what we've seen is that I think that gives us the advantages
of keeping us within the hemoglobin range that we need and then titrating up to 0.7 as expected. And it's only if in fact their potentially is
overshooting, which we don't expect on hemoglobin if one would stay at 0.3.

And then to your point about dose difference, it's fully agreed that from the 6-minute walk distance -- fully agreed from the 6-minute walk distance
there wasn't any difference between the 2 doses. But when you look at the totality of the data

(technical difficulty)

over or using the titration scheme to manage dose. I hope that was clear. I'm getting -- can you hear that?

Yaron Benjamin Werber - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Biotechnology Analyst
Yes. We can hear you, Jay. The -- can I infer then that there's potentially a better outcome, a better improvement at the 0.7 dose on functional class?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes, we're targeting 0.7 as really our target dose. And then using the 0.3 to start going up to 0.7, we will have built within the protocol the opportunity
for the investigators to adjust if they need to. But again, I think we're in a really good range between 0.3 and 0.7. But we are targeting 0.7, yes.

Operator
And our next question comes from Marty Auster of Crédit Suisse.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Martin Douglas Auster - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
I just want to discuss a little bit more about kind of what could prompt filing of sotatercept as an outcome from the STELLAR. So are you looking
for just kind of success in the primary endpoint plus success in that key secondary as sufficient to file that single trial after the 24-week endpoint?

And then also, is there any sort of target for a triple background population in STELLAR? Or is it -- are you pretty agnostic and you'll just kind of
stratify according to background therapy?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. So again, this is Jay. I'll take that. Our plan, and I should have said this earlier -- we're presenting STELLAR today after we have the opportunity
to fully engage both FDA and EMA in our trial designs. So our going forward with STELLAR, as you saw and you heard from Janethe and from Dr.
Hoeper, we're really planning to include basically similar patient populations we had within PULSAR. So not just focus on triplets at all, it'll be the
entire population. And we believe that this single study will be the basis for our submission, yes.

Martin Douglas Auster - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
And again, in the submission, is it success in the primary endpoint as well as that key secondary that you highlighted? Is that what you would
consider to be kind of the basis for filing?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Well, I'll cite to you what typically health authorities say, right? You'd like to see concordance of all the secondary endpoints as well as meeting
your primary endpoint. And again, considering that STELLAR was really -- the basis for STELLAR was PULSAR, we've already demonstrated that, as
you know, within PULSAR.

So it's our expectation that we will have concordance, but it will be the totality of the endpoints that will actually form the basis. But clearly, meeting
the primary and concordance would be needed.

Martin Douglas Auster - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Got it. One last one, Jay. And so it sounds like there's no specification for any kind of minimum patients on background triple therapy. And the last
question I'll have then would be the 6-minute walk endpoint. I'm curious in your discussion with FDA about that versus a VO2 max change or
something like that. Curious on kind of how that conversation led to 6-minute walk ultimately.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. So maybe I'll start with the latter. 6-minute walk, as you know, is a well-established regulatory endpoint. And again, we heard from Marius how
you feel, function or survive. So we went with the standard. We certainly showed that in PULSAR. And so that's the kind of cleanest endpoint that
we can move forward with and run in a multi-center, international study. So that's there. Again, we've got alignment with the health authorities.

And again, with the triple therapy, we expect, frankly, to see within the trial something very similar to what we saw in PULSAR. So I think we'll have
sufficient evidence in that to demonstrate once again that we really add value to those on triplets. But we're running the study against the entire
population.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Operator
And our next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays.

Carter Lewis Gould - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Maybe to take the question around stratification by sort of line of therapy in a different angle, when you look at PULSAR, you only included, I think,
like 10% of patients who are on single background therapy. Jay, just can you clarify? I mean is that sort of what we should expect here? Is that going
to be enough patients? I mean, I guess, that would kind of portend 25 to 30 patients in the study. Is that going to be enough when we think then
around a label that would encompass sort of that earlier setting?

And then I guess with that in mind, as you think then around a potential ceiling effect on 6-minute walk distance, I noticed you did kind of narrow
the baseline 6-minute walk distance somewhat. I guess when you go back and rerun PULSAR with that tighter criteria, any changes you can call
out there?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. Well, let me start with sort of, I think, overall as we look at the entire population. Maybe I'll actually invite Marius to speak to sort of who he
would anticipate coming on the trial. And I'll refer to Janethe a little bit on the PULSAR data.

But I think as we go forward, it will be the totality of information we have in there that, obviously, FDA and others will review to determine what
meets the label criteria. Generally, the prior experience has been if you have concordance across those patients, you would generally get a label
for all of those, right? But that's a future statement.

But maybe, Marius, you can comment about as you think about who would come on the trial, whether we would expect to see the distribution of
mono, double and triple therapy similar to PULSAR.

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes, I assume it's going to be similar but not exactly the same. It's not going to be the same patient population. First of all, I think we will see more
-- let's say, more incident type of patient, so more recently diagnosed, not this average of 7 years after diagnosis. And therefore, it's maybe a bit
less patients on or fewer patients on triple combination therapy. The vast majority will be on double. But there will be also a bit more patients, I
would assume about 20% to 25%, on monotherapies, especially from those countries where not all of the drugs that are available are fully reimbursed.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Right. So Carter, then I think as we go back, we will be in a situation to look at this in the totality. Again, I think the insight that we gain from PULSAR
will be quite helpful. That's what we built into the trial.

And our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Geoffrey Craig Porges - SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - Director of Therapeutics Research & Diversified Biopharma and Senior Research
Analyst
Appreciate all the information on the trial. I wonder if I could just ask you a question, a follow-up to Marius. Could you tell us what degree of
impairment the incident and monotherapy patients typically have to 6-minute walk tests? Are they significantly impaired at that stage in their
progression?

And then just to go back to this question of the statistical plan, Jay, could you give us a sense of what degree of improvement you need to see
across the whole population to achieve a statistical endpoint? Is it the same improvement you saw in PULSAR? Or do you have more statistical
power to achieve your endpoint based on less improvement?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Well, I'll take the statistical one first, and then, Marius, maybe you can add and tackle that first question.

We -- Geoff, we typically don't go through kind of how we -- like what our assumptions were under it, but this is a much larger trial than PULSAR
and typical Phase III trial. So we're in the 90% power range to meet our endpoints, right? So we've got a well-powered study. And again, all of our
discussion with the agencies, we are aligned and concordant with sort of what the change needs to be to meet their expectations.

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes, And regarding stability in 6-minute walk distance, I mean, the PULSAR patients were really very stable. They're kind of selected for being stable
in that study. And yes, 6-minute walk distance at baseline was around 400 meters, which is higher than in most of the studies that we see. So here
in that study, I would expect to see a more, let's say, typical study patient population with a baseline 6-minute walk distance of 350, 360 meters.

Geoffrey Craig Porges - SVB Leerink LLC, Research Division - Director of Therapeutics Research & Diversified Biopharma and Senior Research
Analyst
Sorry, and the incident monotherapy patients, could you just give us a sense of how they look in terms of 6-minute walk impairment?

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
They will probably be the same. When you just think about the more incident patients, so those patients who have not been diagnosed like 7 years
ago but, let's say, 6 months, a year, 2 years ago, so relatively incident, they tend to be less stable. They're less selected in terms of long-term survival.
So you expect these patients to be less stable, also to have more worsening events, which may be important for this study, and perhaps also have
a bit of a steeper trajectory in terms of declining 6-minute walk distance once they're not receiving active therapy.

And our next question comes from Danielle Brill of Raymond James.

Danielle Catherine Brill - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Just following up a little bit more on this, the eligibility in patients on all lines of therapy. I guess there was some expectation that you'd restrict
enrollment to just triple therapy given what we saw in 6-minute walk in PULSAR. Can you just provide some more color on maybe what you saw
in the full dataset that gives you confidence that -- including the double therapy will be mostly because of -- the majority of patients, what gives
you confidence that there's no risk in hitting the primary endpoint? Then I have a quick follow-up.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes, Danielle. So this is Jay. We thoroughly evaluated the PULSAR data. And I think the advantage that we have is not only did we have the 24-week
data, but we also -- as you know, as Janethe walked through, we have the ability to see the placebo patients who crossed over. And so from the
totality of the data, quite honestly, we feel very comfortable and confident in this design, including a similar population as we had in PULSAR, even
if, in fact, we are seeing patients earlier in their disease course, that we will actually meet end -- that primary endpoint. And we feel very good about
that and across those secondary endpoints. So there's a lot of reflection on this. We feel good about it because we have the data to use to build
this study. And again, we socialized this and the data with both FDA and EMA. So I think we're in a really good place.

Danielle Catherine Brill - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then for your planned label expansion studies, can you comment on -- like on sizing? And I guess, that you're supposed
to initiate mid next year, could these read out in a similar time frame as STELLAR?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
I'm sorry, I missed the last part. I missed -- maybe I'm having trouble with my connection. Can you say that again? You want to know about the
other studies?

Danielle Catherine Brill - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Exactly. And then I'm wondering if they're going to be smaller in size and potential timing -- time frame of readout, could it be a similar time frame
as STELLAR?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. No, so I think as much as we were going to share today, it's really important for us, I think, to address a lot of the questions that came from the
time that we reported out the initial PULSAR data. And that's what are your plans with this, are you going to go upfront, are you going to go in the
back, how are you going to manage treatment. And I wanted to really be clear as -- vis-à-vis even all of us that we are running a full development
program. However, the details of that design, the size, outside of telling you that we're working on it now and that we plan to start by midyear next
year, we will give far more detail with both HYPERION and ZENITH at a future state or a future date.

Operator
And our next question comes from Eric Joseph of JPMorgan.

Eric William Joseph - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - VP & Senior Analyst
I just wanted to ask about, well, whether you could talk a bit about sort of the number of trial sites and the locale that you're expecting to set up
for STELLAR and how that reach might differ from PULSAR and what the impact might be to recruitment time lines and the PULSAR experience.

And then just on the mechanics of data readouts from the trial, I believe Dr. Hoeper said you're keeping the blind beyond 24 weeks. Is that just to
the patient. Should we anticipate a readout on the primary and secondary endpoints at 24 weeks?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. So I mean I'll tackle the trial design, and then Janethe, I'll ask her to comment on trial sites and the locations. But yes, good question, Eric.

This trial, frankly, is really modeled after MEDALIST. If you'll recall that trial design that we ran, where we had that blinded period, that allows the
last randomized patient to be able to get to that endpoint while not breaking the blind for everybody else that preceded. So we will plan to report
out, at least declare the primary endpoint, at the time when last patient meets that 24-week mark.

And Janethe, do you just want to comment on trial sites and location relative to what we've done with PULSAR?

Janethe Pena - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - VP of Medical Research & Pulmonary
Yes. Sure. So we are primarily keeping our PULSAR sites for the great majority of them. They performed really well. We are expanding to a few more
countries and sites being recommended and trusting the recommendation of our Steering Committee, including Marius here, to really go to expert
centers to make sure we have the right size and the right investigators doing the study.

Eric William Joseph - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - VP & Senior Analyst
Okay. Great. Just one more question, if I could. On the -- in your statistical analysis plan, are you considering or contemplating any assessments
earlier than 24 weeks, perhaps at 12 weeks? And to the extent you are, can you talk about power and consideration there?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. No, I think we're -- our primary endpoint is 24 weeks. So that's clear. And then you saw from Marius sort of how we're looking at the other
secondary endpoints.

Now as you know, when we get a positive trial, we have the opportunity then to describe things or did we get the onset earlier or later. But from
the specific design of the study, it will be 24 weeks and then the other endpoints that Marius referred to.

Operator
And our next question comes from Yigal Nochomovitz of Citi. And again, our next question comes from Yigal Nochomovitz of Citi.

And our next question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
Congrats on the progress, and I hope all of you at Acceleron as well as Dr. Hoeper are doing well as well. Maybe first for Dr. Janethe Pena. Recently,
it seems like the FDA has sort of been focused on contribution of components, at least in other indications. Just wondering, during your conversations
with the FDA, did ever evaluating sotatercept as a monotherapy in PAH ever come up?

And then a second question. Both PULSAR and STELLAR required patients to have stable treatment with standard of care. I was just wondering if
you could remind us of the duration of treatment without changes to be considered stable in each trial. And sort of on that note for Dr. Hoeper,
wondering, do you see a difference in the length of dosing stability between patients requiring single, double or triple therapy? And also with
those regimens, can you help us understand what your expectations would be for 6-minute walk test performance over time on single, double or
triple? I'm just trying to understand, again, what your expectations would be sort of for the control arm.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. So maybe -- this is Jay. Let me step in. I'll do the FDA question, then, Janethe, you can talk about the criteria, and then I'll let Marius handle.

For FDA interactions, we have Breakthrough Therapy designation. We're actively involved and discuss with them. And so we've gone through the
full range of potential opportunity for us to further explore the benefit of sotatercept. Today, I think we're focused on the STELLAR program, which,
again, we have discussed with FDA. And so you'll hear more about future development. But right now, as you've seen from this trial, it is add-on
design. And then maybe, Marius, to the other question around stability?

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes. It was a very good question. And I think we don't have default answer to this yet because, I mean, PULSAR is still ongoing and we haven't seen
the full long-term data yet. From clinical experiences, that many of the participants in PULSAR had substantial clinical improvement and at least
stability after the 24-week period, sometimes further clinical improvement. We haven't done the hemodynamic follow-up yet.

And I think it was really independent on whether the patients were on, let's say, double or triple combination therapy. There were a few monos,
as you know, so mostly double, triple. This really didn't matter. It's really the individual response to sotatercept that matters, and this is something,
I mean, that we witnessed but can't predict yet.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
All right. Got you. And Dr. Hoeper, just on that note, if a patient is stable on double or triple, which are obviously the predominant therapies here
in the U.S., how would you expect their 6-minute walk test to hold up over time, for instance, at a 24-week endpoint after being stable on therapy?

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes. Again, the magnitude of improvement in some of these patients is quite substantial. So if they come from a 6-minute walk distance like here
in PULSAR's 400 meters, they will reach something that probably is close to what we consider the ceiling effect. So it can't get much higher. And
there are some patients who really make it to functional class. They have no physical impairment at all anymore. And -- but again, further improvement
is difficult. So long-term stability in these patients would be a great achievement. And of course, the other question is whether there are further
effects in terms of improvement beyond the 24 weeks, but this is still data to come.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
Okay. And then one -- right, go ahead.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. And Janethe -- yes, I was going to go back and get to the point that you had asked earlier about how we define stable. I was going to have
Janethe answer that as we didn't get to that.

Janethe Pena - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - VP of Medical Research & Pulmonary
Yes, thank you, Jay. Yes, I wanted to just highlight that for the protocol in PULSAR and what we are looking at, it's stability at study start. They have
to be stable for at least 90 days on those combinations of therapies on the same doses. And I think this is very commonly used in a number of other
                                                                                                                                                                             
 trials. Marius can confirm that. And they have to be stable too during treatment, during the study. So we are assuming that they are managed to
the extent they can on those background therapies.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
Got you. That's helpful. And maybe one final question. Just wondering if there are any sort of internal expectations for the length of time to enroll
284 patients. And if not, maybe, Dr. Hoeper, just wondering if you could help us with your expectations or how you would expect to sort of enroll
patients into this trial on sort of a per month or an annual basis. I would imagine there's quite a bit of excitement especially after PULSAR.

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes. I can start here. I mean the excitement was not only after PULSAR but even during PULSAR because, I mean, today, with all the connections
that patients have on the Internet, and so the patients quickly realized that there is something really ongoing and patients wanted to be in the
trial. And also, it's the first trial, and remember that we had that enrolled quicker than anticipated.

And for STELLAR, I mean, the centers are lined up. The centers want to start. The centers have patients lined up that they want to start. So I hope
that we are able to at least meet the expectations again and perhaps we repeat the PULSAR story. But I don't want to be too overoptimistic here.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. And maybe I can just comment, right? So just as a reminder, when we were thinking about the first study, and STELLAR is the first study, the
criteria that we had going forward is high probability of technical success. And I think a lot of the questions that are being asked of us is the patient
population included, the stability of the patients. All of that's taken into consideration. And we anticipate as we enroll this trial that we will have a
similar population that we had in PULSAR although, as Marius pointed out, maybe not 7 years into their disease but still with enough stability that
I think we will, with confidence, meet the primary endpoint.

But the other important thing about choosing this trial is exactly to your point about time. This has a 6-month endpoint. It's a 284-patient trial.
PULSAR accrued in a year. We're anticipating -- and we usually get better into projections once we get the trial up and running for recruitment
rates, but we do think that we can run this very efficiently and afford us the opportunity here to really get this as the basis of approval in short
order. But we can get more insight as we go further into the trial on timing.

Operator
And our next question comes from Yigal Nochomovitz with Citi.

Samantha Lynn Semenkow - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
This is Samantha on for Yigal. Can you hear me okay?

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Samantha Lynn Semenkow - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
Okay. Great. Apologies for the technical difficulties. I just wanted to ask if there was any consideration given to including time to improvement as
an endpoint in STELLAR. We've heard some physician interest, so it would be interesting if that was considered. And from Dr., if you could say your
thoughts on the relevance of that as an endpoint.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. Maybe I'll tackle that. And Marius, maybe you can add. But if you take a look, we do have functional class improvement built into the trial. So
that is an important endpoint. There is a level at times of some subjectivity to that. So I think one needs to be thoughtful about how it's captured,
but we certainly have that included. I don't know, Marius, if you want to comment.

Marius Hoeper;Hannover Medical School
Yes. Improvement, that's the tricky part here. Of course, you can discuss 6-minute walk distance, but then you have to also define a minimal
important clinical difference. We usually set this at about 30 meters, but this is also not carved into stone.

And what you're aiming is what many of us believe is going to be the future of pulmonary hypertension trials, that we look more at the established
and validated risk stratification tools. For instance, in the U.S., REVEAL and especially REVEAL 2.0 have been -- become quite popular. And also,
these tools have been nicely validated. And it would definitely make our trial designs in the future much easier and much more efficacious if we
could use these tools as primary endpoints because it's -- it could be used as time too, but it could also be used for a fixed time period like 24 weeks.
But it would capture improvement and worsening at the same time and, therefore, would make this entire study designs, trial design, patient
sample size estimations much more efficacious.

Samantha Lynn Semenkow - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Senior Associate
That's helpful. And then just on the label expansion trials, HYPERION and ZENITH, just curious how or whether SPECTRA was used to inform these.
I understand that if you're presenting the initial data in November, you've probably already had a look there. I was just curious on what your thought
is and if there will be any endpoint informed by SPECTRA in those studies.

Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. SPECTRA is giving us insight into a little bit more around sort of functional exercise capacity, et cetera. Didn't necessarily need that data, and
we don't need that data to inform either HYPERION or ZENITH, but it is very interesting data that we're looking forward to sharing.

Operator
And our next question comes from Paul Choi of Goldman Sachs. And again, our next question comes from Paul Choi of Goldman Sachs.

Kyuwon Choi - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst
Two questions from me, please. First, just with regard to the 72-week period, can you maybe just clarify, do you allow crossovers from the control
arm there?

And then secondly, with regard to your filing strategy, are there any essential data points that will be required from the 72-week extension period
as part of your filing considerations? Has that been brought up by any of the regulatory agencies?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jay T. Backstrom - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - Executive VP and Head of Research & Development
Yes. I'll tackle. So no crossover. And again, that whole design in that long-term double blind is to allow patients to continue to get into the trial
before the last patient is randomized. And so we'll continue to gather efficacy and safety data.

Again, the totality of the data really do contribute to our regulatory strategy, but that also includes PULSAR and the open-label extension. So I think
with this one trial STELLAR plus what we already have, we'll meet the regulatory needs. And the beauty of our call today is because we've had those
discussions with the agencies, so I feel confident that, that's the case.

Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Habib Dable for any
closing remarks.

Habib J. Dable - Acceleron Pharma Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. Thank you, operator. And I just want to take the opportunity to thank everybody for joining us today. As you've heard from the presentation,
we're very excited to initiate the planned Phase III STELLAR trial, which, again, is expected before the end of the year, along with the planned
HYPERION and ZENITH studies, which are expected to be initiated in the middle of '21.

And as we continue to advance sotatercept through the clinic, we continue to be very excited about building sotatercept as a backbone therapy
in PAH. And in the meantime, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Todd or Jamie. And in the meantime, I do hope that we'll
be able to connect live one day at some upcoming conferences hopefully during next year. In the meantime, I look forward to connecting through
the virtual conferences for the remainder of this year. All the best.

Thank you, Linda, and good afternoon, good morning, dear participants. And I think I will just jump right into a few comments, and then we'll open
up for the Q&A.

So obviously, I would like to start with a few comments on the market. And I'm sure you all recall our guidance for this quarter where, first of all, in
volume terms, we talked about 10% decline compared with the second quarter based on the seasonality but also the pandemic situation. And
then on top of that, we described the European situation with import pressure and pressure on prices.

And I think today, on the 2nd of October, obviously, having a lead through the third quarter by now, we are still having the same guidance vis-à-vis
the quarter but obviously, would like to comment also a little bit about sort of how we see things at this point in time and what's happening in the
market.

I think we can maybe, on a question basis, come back to some of the details around various segments. But it may be good to still open this up by
saying that the sort of speed of recovery from the pandemic lows in the summertime has certainly been faster in certain segments whereas others
seem to be more slow in the response and particularly segments that are, I would say, more tied to typical investment cycles, there still seems to

                                                                                                                                                                             
 be more hesitation in the customer base. Other segments then closer to maybe customers, if we talk about the clients or automotive, are on a
quicker rebound. All in all, at this point in time, we see typical lead times in Europe of 6 to 8 weeks and in Americas of 5 to 7 weeks, which are quite
normal. So from that perspective, there has been an improvement from the summer period.

There's also been a lot of news actually on trade, various trade measures only in the last few days or so. I would maybe, as the most important piece
of news, highlight that the European Union is now looking into anti-dumping investigation when it comes to cold-rolled imports from Indonesia
and India, and that seems like a very relevant investigation to have been started right now.

We also have the news of the second step or the so-called anti-subsidy investigation and potential tariffs into hot-rolled imports now having been
stopped or withdrawn. So a little bit of news there certainly coming out only this week.

I think when we look into the raw material base and the cost base, overall nickel movements during the quarter have been there but then ending
up at the 14,500. So I would say not -- certainly, not as dramatic as in Q3 of last year but still some upward movement early in the quarter and then
kind of a little bit downwards during September. Maybe no more comments on that at this point.

When it comes to other measures, vis-à-vis cost compression, I think we have kept up the pace. Just making sure that we are as diligent as we can
when it comes to short-term cost compression and spend cuts wherever that is reasonable. You may recall that, in the second quarter, we had
measures in place of around EUR 20 million, and we have continued with the same pace for sure to make sure that we are as diligent as we can
there.

On the working capital and on the cash flow, third quarter is seasonally the quarter, where if you look at the history of Outokumpu as well, it has
been a good quarter vis-à-vis bringing home cash from the working capital. And when we look at the full year target that we have of at least EUR
100 million reduction of working capital, then we are very well on track. And I expect the third quarter also here to contribute in a good and
meaningful way. On the CapEx, the full year budget or estimate there is still at EUR 180 million, as we have communicated before.

So I think with that said, I tried to cover some of the main points and to make sure that I answer the questions that are relevant to the audience, I
would actually propose that we continue with the Q&A session.

So operator, we would be ready for questions now, please.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Anssi Kiviniemi from SEB.

Anssi Kiviniemi - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
It's Anssi from SEB. A couple of them from my side. First of all, you highlighted that there has been a rebound in automotive and perhaps in
appliances, but could you give us a little bit more flavor on what is happening on the other sectors in Europe and in U.S.? And also, as there has
been a rebound in some segments, have you seen any signs of restocking in any of the markets?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Very good. Thank you, Anssi, and good afternoon. So yes, indeed, I mean, when we look at appliances, I can only comment that there are some
good governmental actions in, for example, Germany when it comes to VAT reduction, but more generally, maybe this is a question of sort of
                                                                                                                                                                             
 people spending time at home and then realizing that there is really a need for new appliances in the household. This could potentially be an
explanation, of course. Of course, this rebound kind of back to the level of pre the COVID crisis is visible at the moment.

Then when we talk about automotive, I need to be a little bit more careful because, for those of you who follow this closely, you obviously know
that automotive was not even kind of towards end of 2019 on any kind of strong sentiment. So I think what I just want to communicate clearly is
that we see automotive volumes coming more to, so to say, levels that we had pre the COVID, but that doesn't mean that they are on high levels
compared with, so to say, historical highs. But somewhat of a normalization there. Obviously, we have seen more premium segments bounce back
first, and now we start to see kind of more positive moments as well than in the more standards there.

So I certainly don't want to kind of make too big of a story of that. There is still way to go to the really kind of historical normals, but at least rebound
is visible.

Then I think I would focus on a few other segments in Europe. I think I already shortly commented that if we then look at more, what I would call,
so to say, heavy industrial uses or whether it's maybe oil and gas related, et cetera, so sectors where our products would typically are maybe used
for certain more sort of CapEx-type investments and maybe then the good example as well that relates to oil and gas industry is the scrubbers. I
think these sectors are still -- I guess there are both very strong linkages to what makes sense as what oil price is and then obviously, a cautionary
approach by companies into CapEx spend.

So here in these sectors, we still have a slower market. And that has some impact on our mix as well. Obviously, these are typically products from
the, so to say, better end of the margin range.

And then maybe a final comment in Europe on distribution. Here, the inventory levels have been average or even slightly above for a period of
time. So I cannot really talk about restocking right now. I think what we really see with distributors is that this segment is, in Europe, very much
impacted by imports as well. And I think it's fair to say a few words about imports because now we have the new safeguard system with the quarterly
quota. And it literally means that the first month of the quarter is under a lot of pressure from imports. I mean, in July, what we saw was the -- about
45% import share, which is enormously high.

I have [then] that these figures clearly below 30% from August and would assume that then September is lower again, but it seems that we will
have more of a sort of quarterly tempo now in the import pressure based on the new quarterly quota system. And particularly with distribution,
of course, also with other segments, but particularly with distribution, we are competing here as well with the import volumes.

So I would say that's sort of the European picture. So that's why I said also early on that the seasonality certainly has been there as it has been in
historical years as well. And we certainly still see the pandemic impact with different emphasis in different segments, but it's still there. And that
also causes some lack of visibility going forward if we think about what will happen. For example, next year, it's clear that we are not yet out of the
woods in full when it comes to the pandemic.

There is -- maybe then a few additional comments about Americas. So in Americas, of course, first of all, the seasonal pattern is not the same as in
Europe between Q2 and Q3, so I wouldn't highlight that as any sort of important factor there. Also, distributor inventories have been on a low level
for a period of time. And that restocking cycle has maybe been kind of expected. But what we do see right now is that distributors are still clearly
giving the message that they are very cautious building up higher inventories. And maybe in Americas, we see a little bit more of this typical --
what used to be maybe the pattern that if nickel price goes up, then kind of on the way up, there is more willingness to stock. But obviously now
in September, the nickel price has been more stable or even a little bit down through the end here. So I would say that in the Americas market, we
are still very much in a situation with rather low inventory levels at the moment.

Anssi Kiviniemi - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Then perhaps another question or theme is the nickel. So basically, have you been able to push the higher nickel price to your customers as
we have seen a big rally in the spot market there? Or have the margins been under pressure in Europe? Also, kind of what has been your exposure
to nickel from hedging perspective when we have entered into this peak nickel price?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes, indeed. Hey, maybe I can take the hedging question just upfront as it is an easy one to answer. I don't expect any material impact from hedges
during the third quarter. So that's maybe just a short answer there. And then I need to give a more longer answer to the question of -- because you
both ask that have we been able to put -- transfer the higher nickel prices to customers. And then you also asked is this putting margins under
pressure. And I think already starting from our guidance, we have talked about pricing pressure in Europe, obviously, linked to the higher import
levels and also more generally, so there has been a pressure on the prices.

Now then to your particular question about how we've been able to transfer the higher nickel prices to customers. I think this is now -- this comment
focus is only on BA Europe because in the other BAs, obviously, we still have the alloy surcharge type of pricing. And in BA Europe, as we know
now, this new typical method of pricing, with the affected prices has been there for quite some period of time. So I think we have at least very good
processes in place. We have a very good understanding how to steer this, and we have the mechanism, so to say, to run this. But obviously, always
on the run up, it's a lot of hard work to make this happen.

But I'm not particularly worried about do we have kind of the tools and the processes to manage this. I think what I'm seeing more generally is
exactly what we already brought in our guidance that there is import pressure, and we are obviously still in a pandemic period. So there has been
price pressure during the quarter.

Anssi Kiviniemi - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Then the last one from my side on production. Has it gone according to plans in Q3? Have there been any other issues than the previously
highlighted Ferrochrome maintenance break?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes. Yes. No, the Ferrochrome maintenance one, obviously, that's a really big one. And I think maintenance was carried out during September. It
has been going according to plan, and we are actually now in the sort of start-up phase after the investment. And so far, everything runs exactly
according to plan. So that looks kind of good and normal at this point in time. And then if we talk about other production steering and production
performance during the third quarter, I think there's a number of things that we have been running with a lot of attention and care.

So first of all, still being obviously in a pandemic situation. So if we think about our operations, for example, in the U.S., the COVID-19 situation is
still -- definitely has been very much a question still during the quarter. But we have been able to operate normally despite the pandemic still being
definitely an issue. So no kind of concerns or anything to report from that side.

Then furthermore, during the quarter, we have been very diligently evaluating how we do maintenance, where we do maintenance and what is
the appropriate level of maintenance at these demand levels. So there's been a lot of focus into that area with also some maintenance being
postponed to later quarter, but nothing really so material that I would mention it here.

And then apart from that, we have been partially furloughing people as well as having, for example, short-term work and always kind of controlling
this and then bringing people back at the right moment, et cetera, a lot of attention and focus there as well. So Anssi, I guess what I want to say is
that this has certainly not been kind of your normal quarter, I mean, we are still -- from the volume basis, these are also low volumes. And there are
these challenges that it kind of entails because we bring shifts down and then we bring shifts up, so a lot of attention and care. But there have been
no so kind of material issues or problems that I would like to describe here or that would have been so important that I should mention them here.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld, Exane BNP.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Seth R. Rosenfeld - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
If I may, I have 2 questions. First, following up on maintenance expense. Thank you for confirming Ferrochrome outage has proceeded according
to plan. If possible, can you confirm any expectation for unique maintenance outage costs in Q4? Should we expect that EUR 15 million cost in Q3
to be stripped out going into Q4 or replaced with something different? On a go-forward basis, you commented on some maintenance being
deferred due to the COVID conditions. What scale has been deferred? Just so we understand what cost overhang might be going forward. I'll start
there, please.

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes, exactly. Very good question. So first of all, I can only confirm that the -- it is unique to have this kind of EUR 15 million cost and profit impact
from the maintenance at one go in one furnace, so that is the reason also that we have described it. So we don't have any single case that would
be as significant in Q4. That is already evident right now.

And just to sort of give you some comparison because we have not given the Q3 figures yet, but during Q2, for example, we have some of the cases
on some of the lines, for example, in Avesta and Tornio, and there was maybe order of magnitude some, let me call it, EUR 10 million to EUR 12
million that was deferred as well. So I think this is the order of magnitude that can be handled and where it can make sense if the volumes are lower
in some particular quarter or in some particular period to do.

And then obviously, vis-a-vis if there is any single really big case in Q4, then we will give it in our guidance as well. But my expectation is more that
we'll go more into a pattern where there's a number of maintenance cases happening across all sites. So the cumulative definitely can still be closer
to kind of normal levels in Q4, but we will get back to that. I don't want to go too deep into Q4 because there are still some topics that are in the
making there.

Seth R. Rosenfeld - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
Just to clarify on your comment. Did you say that for Tornio in Q2, you deferred EUR 10 million to EUR 12 million?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
It was predominantly Tornio and Avesta. And then there have been some smaller sites as well but just to give the view.

Seth R. Rosenfeld - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. So that's the scale of catch-up in the future. And then a separate question. On the U.S. market, I think we've seen some of the benchmark
base prices decline in the last 2 months. Meanwhile, the largest player in the U.S. has confirmed that their base price realizations have been stable.
Can you give us some sense on your own price realizations and whether or not you've felt that base price pressure in your sales?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes. Well, obviously, right now, it's also an important point, just initiating discussions also about annual contracts, 2021, et cetera. So there's a lot
of noise, I would say, around this out there. But can I comment this in a way that, first of all, for Europe, we have really described the price pressure,
but I have no such description to give for Americas. I really want to say the situation is kind of more neutral there. And there's also very normal lead
times at this point. So I think that there are not really kind of clear ingredients for price pressure at the moment. I do recognize kind of the data
that you talk about. But I really shouldn't, so to say, make a big deal out of that.

Your next question comes from the line of Luke Nelson from JPMorgan.

Luke Nelson - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Research Analyst
Two questions. Firstly, just on Ferrochrome. In Q2, you sold a high proportion on spot versus contract. Can you give any indication around how
that is trending in Q3? And my second question is just on mix, clearly, a negative effect in Q2 -- in the Q2 waterfall. Can you just give a sense on
how we should quantify the improvement quarter-on-quarter, Q3 versus Q2 given obviously greater market share with orders and higher end
users but also your comments around oil and gas and that market being a bit more slow?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes, exactly. Yes. So if I just start with the Ferrochrome. I mean the reliance on the spot market in Q2 was driven, to a large extent, by the fact that
we had lower internal volumes but also by the fact that we had a very quick drop in the internal volumes following the COVID situation. So I mean,
April was -- April and kind of Q2, we had a big drop compared with the original plans because, as you have seen, obviously, even when compared
with Q1, we dropped about 10% in volume. So there was an element of lower internal volumes, and then a need, of course, to place volumes
because some of this was unplanned.

Now I think this is only then to indicate that the visibility, though still not -- nowhere near kind of normal time periods, as I alluded to earlier, but
it's still clear that there was a little bit more, so to say, ability to have the view of the coming months as we learn more of the dynamics of how this
period works. So I think that has, to a certain extent, helped here. So the kind of element of very rapid change is not there. But I would still assume
that under the context of lowish internal volumes, we will need to place some as well on the spot markets. So maybe that was a round answer, but
I think the direction is towards still some spot volumes as well in Q3.

Then if I speak to really the mix component of the variance bridge and kind of what we see from Q1 to Q2 and then Q2 to Q3, when I spoke to the
different segments and the development that we see there, then I think it's fair to say that some of the higher-margin segments are now not
rebounding with, so to say, quick speed. And I think that's definitely something that is on the negative side thinking about our mix. That has to be
spelled out. So I think without giving you an exact figure, I would say that there was still kind of pressure in some of those better grades from --
even from Q2 into Q3. But obviously, there are also other elements playing in here. So I think giving you a magnitude would kind of be quite
cumbersome at this point in time. We obviously don't have all the analytics even completed yet. But I would assume that there is some pressure
in the mix also from Q2 to Q3.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Harri Taittonen from Nordea.

Harri Taittonen - Nordea Markets, Research Division - Senior Director & Sector Coordinator
So I think most of the questions have been answered, but maybe one question on the -- kind of based on the statistics. It seems that the hot-rolled
restrictions have worked to some extent based on the sort of a lower input. Have you sort of benefited from that at all? What are you seeing directly
from where you are?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes, yes, yes. Harri, I think that's a fair question. And as seen in the statistics, there have been less import pressure. And I think as there's been both
the opportunity for the volume and as well the price is always set as well in the balance between the demand and the supply. So it's a positive
impact. Of course, the cold-rolled share is much bigger and has much more weight. But this has been a positive contributor.

Harri Taittonen - Nordea Markets, Research Division - Senior Director & Sector Coordinator
Right. Right. Is there anything you can say about the sort of the possible timing of the, say, for example, provisional measures? Now the investigation
was started just a few days ago. But based on the experience from 1 year ago, then it took a few months before the provisional.

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Indeed, indeed. Yes, yes. So I think, yes, exactly. I mean we almost kind of have the -- we could almost follow this sort of month by month at what
happened and how it played out. I mean what we have seen historically is, of course, that it's not only the -- even really imposing the decision about
the provision on tariffs that is important. But it's even the momentum is created at the point in time where, for example, some sort of ledgering or,
what is the correct term, that all import volumes start to be noted or starts to be documented or measured. And usually, already, that can have
some level of impact into the, so to say, balance and the thinking in the market. That's what we have seen historically. But I mean I think formally,
there is 8 months' time. So I think that's kind of the only kind of official information that we have at the point in time that this could take up to 8
months.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ioannis from Masvoulas (sic) [Ioannis Masvoulas from Morgan Stanley].

Ioannis Masvoulas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst
A few left from my side. The first one, just along the Long Products business. You announced a restructuring plan. Could you give us some indication
around restructuring costs and what sort of sustainable savings you're expecting to achieve? Then second question in terms of the quotas. So we
have the reset going into October but at the same time, we're seeing the difference in pricing. Europe versus Asia, it's not as big as it was a few
months ago. Could we see a situation where the spike in October is not as bad as it was in July? And then very last question on the volume
progression, how should we think about Q4 relative to Q3 in Europe and the Americas?

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Indeed. I mean very good questions. So first of all, on the Long Products, I try to give you some order of magnitude from our earlier announcements.
But I still think this is something that we will come back to because together with the announcement that we concluded the strategic review into
a turnaround plan, we did also give the information about the planned reduction of 100 headcount. However, as this was sort of planned and the
initial announcement, we did not yet give precise information about what sort of impact this could have savings nor onetime costs.

So at the moment, I just need to say that last year, we announced this 350 headcount reduction in Germany. And there, the onetime costs were
about EUR 50 million. And typically, what I have seen in payback times sort of through the years of this kind of initiatives is somewhere between
1 and 2 years. So that is kind of how it normally or typically works out.

But we will come back to this question for sure. So now that the plan is initiated and the more detailed plans and negotiations are being carried
out, we will assess this, and as soon as we have information available, we will publish it. So that was your question on LP.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And then obviously, I completely agree with you that it's a new situation right now when the delta between the pricing really is nonexistent between
Asia and Europe. And I think that this certainly can have an impact. I mean, still in June and kind of prior to the 1st July to September period, there
was still some delta to be actually -- that was probably interesting as well. So I agree that this could take some of the pressure out, but I think it's
difficult to quantify it at this point in time.

And certainly, also the general market momentum plays in here. So we still know that there is capacity in Asia. That situation has not changed, but
probably, there is also an improved demand situation locally. So if the pricing level here is not interesting and buyers here can buy local at the
same price, maybe the dynamic will slightly shift. But I think that remains to be seen. We have seen so many, many quick movements that it's -- I
think quantifying this is difficult at this point in time.

And then your question about the volume progression into Q4. I think the market sentiment that I tried to describe earlier as well, of course, is what
we can see right now. And certainly then, as this particular guidance for Q4 or really volumes into Q4, we will probably come back then with our
Q3 report.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Fairclough from Bank of America.

Jason Robert Fairclough - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Head of the Developed & Emerging EMEA Metals and Mining Equity Research
The -- just 2 quick ones from me on -- one on sort of balance sheet and cash flow and then the other one on sort of how we should think about the
trends in profitability. So just in terms of cash flow, I mean, Outokumpu was already quite highly levered coming into this crisis. So you've talked
about working capital inflow. And I guess the question is, is there a potential that as you ramp the business back up that you actually face some
more balance sheet pressure as you need to rebuild working capital. So that's the first question.

Second question, just in terms of profitability. There seems to be sort of 2 different, if you like, models of profitability for steel companies showing
up. With some of the steel companies, it looks like we're going to see trough profitability in Q2, whereas for some of the other companies, it looks
like actually Q3 could even be worse than Q2 through some combination of volumes and pricing pressure. I don't know if there's any color you can
share on that.

Pia Alexandra Aaltonen-Forsell - Outokumpu Oyj - CFO
Yes, that's a good question. I'll start with the balance sheet first. I would maybe just first comment on the working capital reduction sort of journey
that Outokumpu has taken and clearly already starting back in 2019, where we were running quite significant programs. For example, Americas
contributed a lot into the EUR 200 million reduction in working capital that we could see in 2019. I think actually like 2/3 of that reduction was from
Americas. And it's clear that we have seen still a fairly healthy Q1 of this year. And to a large extent, we have been able to maintain those inventory
levels that we set as targets at the point in time when we initiated the 2019 program for reduction.

So obviously, that's sort of a first step that I feel is pretty well, could I say, anchored or built in now into our system and how we operate. Now we
are targeting a further EUR 100 million reduction during this year. And now we are talking about reductions predominantly through Europe because
we took such a substantial step in Americas already last year. And then obviously, now when we have been walking through this -- or going through
these reductions, the demand situation has been lower. And I think you are absolutely right that then in a higher demand situation, there might
be pressure on the whole system in the terms of, okay, probably, we want to increase inventory levels at certain points, et cetera. I can only say
that we have now built a granular control of particularly kind of thinking through the flow, how the inventory moves to our system, thinking through
the points where we want to carry inventory and the points where we really just want to have a flow-through, thinking about the tonnes that we
carry in all of these various points.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So I think we have a very well-elaborated system that we have been steering. But we still have improvement opportunities there. So I would say
that we have also developed as a company. We have developed our practices. And I think this will help us also on the rebound. And I would also
say that the earlier EUR 200 million reduction is pretty well built into the system right now.

But for the additional EUR 100 million of this year, do I see more opportunities in 2021? I think I would be careful to promise that at this point. Do
I think we are able to keep it at the level where we will take it at the end of the year? That is at least our very clear ambition right now. So we are
building all of our plans so that we can keep it then at that level.

So that was a long answer, but your question was really good and really relevant. And still, just to give some sort of order of magnitude, I mean it
is also that where we had the really big shifts in nickel price in Q3 of last year, we added, in 1 quarter, EUR 70 million to inventory just through the
nickel price. But you may remember that those were pretty extreme moments that we saw at that point in time.

Then to your -- yes. Then into your other question, which was around the profitability and kind of whether the trough is Q2 or Q3, I think from
Outokumpu's part, in a sense, I can be pretty clear because at least when it comes to volumes, we have confirmed that we have a guidance where
Q3 is lower than Q2. It is seasonality, but it is also seasonality in combination with the COVID-19. And we have pricing pressure in Europe. So I think
it's anyway clear that there are factors that are putting pressure on the profits in the third quarter. Plus we also, by coincidence, have the maintenance
in Ferrochrome, where we have been pretty clear that, that is a EUR 15 million hit on EBITDA.

However, I want to say that we have still been as diligent as in the second quarter to really find all of the opportunities for cost compression and
for cutting all spends that is reasonable to cut in the quarter. So we are fighting back, and we are taking the measures that are appropriate and
that are in our hands.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome, and thank you for joining the Recordati reverse merger announcement
conference call. (Operator Instructions)

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Marianne Tatschke, Investor Relations of Recordati. Please go ahead, madam.

Marianne Tatschke - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Director of IR & Corporate Communications
Good morning to everybody, and thank you for attending the Recordati conference call. Andrea Recordati, our CEO; and Luigi La Corte, CFO, will
be explaining our recent announcement of a reverse merger transaction.

For a better understanding of this presentation, please access the certain slides available on our website, www.recordati.com, under the Investors
section and Presentations tab. At the end of the presentation, we will answer any questions you may have.

Andrea, please go ahead.

Andrea Recordati - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - CEO & Director
Thank you. Thank you, Marianne, and thank you, everybody, for connecting this morning through this reverse merger announcement conference
call.

So after 2 years, the majority ownership of Recordati by CVC Partners, the project was started with the aim of shortening the control chain with
respect to the operating companies of the group. Recordati Board of Directors has now approved the project, which, of course, will be then held
to a vote at an Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting.

The Board approved the incorporation of both Rossini Investimenti and Fimei in Recordati. Following the merger, Rossini S.a.r.l will directly own
the 51.82% holding in Recordati currently held by Fimei.

This decision provides several benefits to both the majority shareholders and to the Recordati group. The merger aims at shortening the chain of
control with respect to the operating companies of the group, resulting in a simplification of the corporate governance structure and in a reduction
in the costs associated with maintenance of the disappearing companies; and for the surviving company, in lower taxes due to the tax benefits
transferred by the disappearing companies.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The transaction provides a tax benefit for Recordati, as mentioned, deriving from the possibility of using the ACE surplus approved by Rossini
Investimenti with a nonrecurring reduction in taxes of approximately EUR 12.9 million and thereafter, an annual recurring benefit of around EUR
1.3 million.

Most importantly, the net asset and income profile of Recordati remains substantially in line with the current one. In particular, the merger does
not alter Recordati's net financial position and, therefore, its investment capability nor its capital allocation strategy or policy.

Furthermore, the shareholdings of the main shareholder and those of other investors are unaffected by this transaction.

I will now leave the floor to our CFO, Luigi La Corte, to take you through the technical details of the proposed merger and answer any questions
you might have. Thank you very much.

Luigi, the floor is yours.

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. So on Slide 3, I will illustrate what the merger plan foresees and what the end result will be.

I'll start first with a little bit of background. As I'm sure you will recall, in 2018, Rossini S.a.r.l. and ultimately, Rossini Luxembourg S.a.r.l. acquired the
majority stake in Recordati via the acquisition through Rossini Investimenti S.p.a., the new co, of 100% of the share capital of Fimei, the holding
company of the previous owners. Rossini Investimenti and Fimei are 2 pure holding company with, as noted on the slide, very little in terms of
additional net assets beyond the shareholding in Recordati. In fact, you will see both Rossini and Fimei excluding the shareholding in Recordati
have net assets of around EUR 2 million at the end of June 2020. Both entities also have no financial debt. It is, as you'll appreciate, a fairly complex,
long chain of control.

As contemplated already in the tender offer documents at the time of the acquisition in 2018, Rossini Luxembourg sent to Recordati and the other
companies a request in June to move forward with the process to merge Rossini Investimenti and Fimei into Recordati. They did so in June following
a positive ruling by the Italian tax authorities, which confirmed Rossini Investimenti's entitlement through the ACE benefit, which is described in
more detail in the appendix, but essentially is -- allows a deduction for a notional return on the capital, which was injected into the company at
the time of the acquisition.

Following receipt of the request, Recordati with Fimei and Rossini have put in place the procedure, which is foreseen for it is a major transaction
with a related party to assess the merger. And the merger plan, which was foreseen -- which has been agreed, foresees, first of all, that -- any cash
-- net cash that is residual in the companies net of charges, taxes, costs and debt would be paid out prior to the effective date of the merger. And
also, that Rossini Investimenti and Fimei would be discharged of any obligations that they have arising from the original acquisition of Fimei.

As a result, at the effective date, Rossini Investimenti and Fimei effectively will only hold the shares in Recordati. Rossini shares will only hold the
shares in Fimei. And the merger plan foresees that the shares, which Fimei holds in Recordati, will be reassigned to Rossini S.a.r.l.

The end result is, therefore, that Rossini S.a.r.l. will simply hold all the shares currently held by Fimei -- or which will be held by Fimei prior to the
merger, and all other shareholders will also continue to hold the number of shares that they held before the merger. So all shareholdings are
unaffected.

Turning on to Slide 4. As I said, this being a major transaction with the related party, it was assessed by the committee for transactions with related
parties, which is wholly controlled by independent directors who issued their favorable binding opinion on the transaction. And specifically, the
committee was called to assess the fairness of the exchange and the specific interest that Recordati had in pursuing the transaction.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 As referenced already and as mentioned, there is a tax benefit for the allowance for corporate equity, which will be transferred to Recordati S.p.A.
As Andrea mentioned, this -- the accrued benefit by Rossini and that will be accrued up until the effective date of the merger is estimated to be
worth EUR 12.9 million, and Recordati will enjoy a EUR 1.3 million annual recurring benefit [in all], EUR 1 million in 2021.

The merger is conditional upon confirmation also by an independent appraiser, which will be appointed by the Court of Milan on the fairness of
the exchange. It is subject to the Italian government not exercising its veto right under the Golden Power regulation that was recently extended
in its reach to the pharmaceuticals sector in light of the COVID pandemic. And it's also, obviously, subject to, as said, the 2 merging entities being
discharged of any and all obligations and liens resulting from the original acquisition of Fimei. And finally, that no material adverse changes would
occur between now and effective date that could change any of the basic assumptions and the risk profile behind the -- assumed in the plan. And
ultimately, as Andrea also said, that it is subject to shareholder approval.

The -- it is also -- there is, as mentioned, no change in Recordati's articles association nor in the number of shares, which have been issued. The
existing shareholders in Recordati S.p.A. are unaffected by the merger. There is no change in the net financial position strategy nor capital allocation
policy of Recordati S.p.A. And also importantly, no impact on the financial statements of Recordati. As explained in more detail in the appendix,
this being a transaction amongst entities under common control where the merging entities do not meet the definition of businesses, this will not
fall under the application of IFRS 3. The merger will be accounted for from the perspective of Recordati as a surviving entity, which will recognize
any assets or liabilities, which are transferred to book value with no pushdown accounting of any goodwill or assessment at fair value of any
intangibles that may have arisen as a result of the original acquisition. So once again, Recordati's financial statements will remain substantially
unaffected.

And finally, alongside the merger plan, a merger agreement was entered into which provides customary representation and warranties on the part
of Rossini Luxembourg S.a.r.l., which also makes and governs the interim management of the company between now and the effective date and
in the litigation provisions in case of any breaches or changes to, vis-à-vis those representations and warranties, which are -- have been provided.

And finally, on Slide #5, you will see a timetable of next steps. We aim by the 8th of October to publish the details of the merger plan and the
information document, which will be made available to investors.

The government -- Italian government has 45 days to express its either veto or conditions. We don't expect, frankly, any to apply as there was no
effective change of control.

We are waiting for the appointment of the expert by the Court of Milan, and we're expecting that expert to then be able to provide their opinion
on the fairness of the exchange and the terms of the merger by the middle of November.

Based on this time line that we expect the extraordinary shareholder meeting to be held in the middle of December.

And with regards to then effective dates. And clearly, on February, the merging entities will finalize the financial statements, which will be the basis
for any final residual dividends to pay out any net assets, which are in the company, again, net of any liabilities or debt.

And immediately after the close on 31st of March, the deed of merger will be finalized in the early days of April with an effective date for accounting
and tax purposes of April 1.

With that, operator, I guess, we'll be opening up the call for questions.

Marianne Tatschke - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Director of IR & Corporate Communications
Yes, operator, can you please start the Q&A session?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
This is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from
Jo Walton with Crédit Suisse.

Jo Walton - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD
Just a couple. Am I right in assuming that the timing of this announcement was effectively down to the tax authorities. Then this is something you
had in mind, you needed to get the tax guidance so that you knew that you'd get the onetime gain and then the ongoing element. Now you've
got that, you can put it in play?

You say there'll be substantially no change to the costs. I mean presumably -- I mean, it's absolutely de minimis. So there should be, apart from the
tax element, absolutely no change to our numbers.

And finally, as we have both the CEO and the CFO, I wonder if you could just give us an update, anything that we should be mindful of that has
happened in the third quarter.

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
Yes. You're absolutely right on the first 2, Jo. The timing is absolutely deriving from the receipt of the confirmation from Italian tax authorities of
Rossini Investimenti's entitlement.

To the credit, it was earlier -- it was received earlier this year. The procedure is a quite robust one that a transaction with a major related party goes
through. And so we just took the due diligence in time to go through that, as I described, involving the independent directors and advisers.

And in terms of impact on the Recordati's financial statement, absolutely will be de minimis. I mean I can't say 0 because there may be some residual
assets, residual liabilities. But as I hopefully, I illustrated, the company, 2 holding companies, are pure holding companies with essentially nothing
in them but the Recordati shareholding.

I think we're going to ask you to be patient on Q3, Jo. We have nothing really to add versus what we said at Q2 and even Q1 in terms of the effects
of the dynamics. So please bear with us until October 29 on that one.

Jo Walton - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD
And you will book this presumably then in the EUR 12.9 million exceptional gain? Or do you believe that this is part of your ongoing business, it
will happen in 2Q next year, presumably?

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
No. We are -- this would be a nonrecurring, Jo. I think we've been very clear...

Marianne Tatschke - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Director of IR & Corporate Communications
(inaudible) booking.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
Sorry. Oh, sorry, well, we have to -- first of all, we have to wait for the transaction to be approved, obviously. And therefore, we would book this
once the merger takes place in 2021.

Operator
The next question is from KC Arikatla with Goldman Sachs.

Krishna Chaitanya Arikatla - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
You mentioned that there won't be any change to Recordati's financial position. Andrea, can you reassure investors at this stage that there is no
plan for transferring the debt that CVC had taken to fund the acquisition on to Recordati's balance sheet some point in the future?

Andrea Recordati - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - CEO & Director
A simple word, yes, I can reassure you on this.

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
There is no plan.

Andrea Recordati - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - CEO & Director
There is no plan. There's no -- there's absolutely no plan, no risk that I see on that. Absolutely, absolutely 0.

Operator
The next question is from [Marcos Bala] with Morgan Stanley.

Unidentified Analyst
My questions have been (inaudible) just to make clear for bondholders, I guess.

Marianne Tatschke - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Director of IR & Corporate Communications
No. We can't hear you.

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
We're losing you. You're coming and going.

Unidentified Analyst
Hello? Can you hear me now?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
Yes. Now we can hear you better.

And no, we cannot again. You're coming and going.

Unidentified Analyst
Can you hear me now?

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
Yes. Let's try again. And otherwise, you may want to dial back in from a different line and we'll...

Unidentified Analyst
Apologies. My questions have been answered. Just wanted to follow up on one. For bondholders, I guess, there is no consent coming up. We don't
have to vote on this transaction. It's all for the shareholders. Is that correct?

Luigi Felice La Corte - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - Group CFO
The bondholders do not have to vote on this transaction. I can't speak, honestly, for the bondholders. My understanding, though, as I said, is this
potential shortening of the control chain in Italy was foreseen, both in the original NTA and in the own holder -- and whole prospects, and there's
no change that I could see from a bondholder perspective.

But again, we certainly will not be voting on the -- on this matter. But I don't see any change either.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Isacco Brambilla with Mediobanca.

Isacco Brambilla - Mediobanca - Banca di credito finanziario S.p.A., Research Division - Equity Analyst
Just a very quick one. Can you remind us which is the majority threshold to be achieved at the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting in December
to approve the transaction?

Andrea Recordati - Recordati Industria Chimica e Farmaceutica S.p.A. - CEO & Director
Yes. It's 2/3 of shareholders attending the meeting.

Isacco Brambilla - Mediobanca - Banca di credito finanziario S.p.A., Research Division - Equity Analyst
2/3. Okay. Got it.

Thank you, Chantal. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's conference call to listen to our discussion of QEP's financial results for the

 Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Stanley, thank you, and thank the participants for joining us on this Friday with all of the things that are going on together, so it's appreciated. By
now, we hope that you've had an opportunity to look at the press release that we made. And if you have any additional questions, certainly ask
for Paula, when you call QEP, will direct you to the right person. Joining us this morning also is Adam Morgan, our General Counsel; and Enos Brown,
who is our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President.

During the presentation, we'll also ask Enos to give you a review of the cost side of our business, and Leonard will give you a review of some of the
opportunities on the Internet side of our business as we go forward.

So first, I would like to tell you that we've had a good first half of the year, considering the COVID-19 pandemic everywhere. As you know, we had
-- in the first quarter, we were affected greatly by $15 million in lost sales, but we seem to be making it up on a regular basis. I can tell you, looking
into the future, it's very, very difficult to see where we are, but we put things in place that I'll tell you that will have a good effect on the next 6
months as we go forward. I can give you some indication of what we think in the month of September. We believe we've had the highest sales
month in the history of the company, or at least one of them. We've done over $39.5 million in the month of September, and October has taken
off almost the same way. We're using the increased sales and increased profitability to increase our human capital in the company making a
difference.

We also have made great strides on our wood business with one of the major wood sellers in the United States on a private label opportunity for
us. We've shipped 2 orders so far to our major customer in ceramic tile, which we own a small percentage of, and we have a bright future for that.
Also, in our international division, run by Paul, although we have had lockdowns in New Zealand completely, and now it's a partial return, lockdowns
again in Australia and England has been off and on as Germany and Spain, et cetera, we continue to make progress. Our sales are up 12% on a year
-- year-to-year. We have received some government help in all of these locations. However, we have also watched the cost side of our business
continue to go down. So where we are is, I think, in a good place on a worldwide basis. And the dollar, which affects us greatly, has been less than
strong, which doesn't hurt us.

So as we look forward to the year, we've gotten an awful lot of traction as we go forward on a day-to-day basis, and we're reviewing everything
possible, looking under every stone, whether it's the real estate, our capital investment, et cetera, et cetera.

I do want to point out that during this perilous time, the company has paid down $18 million in debt and more to go. We're cash positive to a nice
degree, and we continue to make progress on that.

In other parts of the world that we didn't mention before, in South America, for example, we have the 2 largest chains in South America, which
now are almost 100% QEP, and they seem to be doing better month after month. And the relationships that we have with these people generally
are quite good.

In Canada, as we have mentioned previously, we've had a process called CCA, which is a reorganization, not a bankruptcy. And where we are right
now is we're looking to exit that in the next few weeks. We have filed our plan with the bank in Toronto. And the voting on the plan starts
approximately the 12th and then we'll know exactly where we are. We believe that the process will save us a minimum of $3 million to $7 million,
somewhere in that area, depending on where we go and we have to return. We're cash positive in Canada, and we've returned to profitability and
our forecast is that it should be good for us.

We've retreated from several of the onerous leases that we have, and we're moving primarily our operation into the Toronto area, which will be
headquarters for the Kraus Company as we go forward.

In England, Paul is on the line, who runs our international division. Paul was recently promoted. He's a director of the company, and he is also --
Paul, I want you to say nice things about me after this. He's also been working very closely with Bruce in Australia, and these 2 guys are a lethal
combination. We believe we're sitting in Australia on potential with our ceramic tile that we hope comes to fruition the next month that might be
astounding, considering we have 400 stores that are a potential for us. They've done a real yeoman job in Australia and New Zealand, considering
the tremendous problem with the virus on a worldwide basis.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Most recently, there's been a lot of speculation on what will happen with housing starts and remodeling. For us, it's been quite strong. And the
forecast, supposedly, from the latest indications that we get as this will continue, which is good for us as people remodel. And also the fires and
the hurricanes, et cetera, represent opportunity for your company because we have the replacement parts for that.

We continue to monitor our cost side, and in a moment, Enos Brown, our CFO, will give you more indication of where that is. I do want to tell you
that we're working, we recognize our directors who've been pushing us to resource from China and find other avenues. We're doing this on a
continuous basis. It's not as easy as we think because many of the products we buy from China are made specifically for us in first class. Although
we have moved a lot of our production on the flooring to Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, et cetera, and we continue to do that. We do maintain
an office in Shanghai, 14 people. And we're constantly looking for new areas. As you know, because of the travel restrictions all over Asia, if you
found a new customer, a new vendor that you want to go to, you get locked down there for 2 weeks and you return to China, you lock down for
another 2 weeks. So it's a slow process, we're working on that. We also are working with a home center in India. Hopefully, we'll have some good
news on that.

So I'm going to interrupt my own conversation and ask Enos to pick up on some of the more detailed financial information, and he'll be available
for questions after this. Enos?

Enos Brown - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - SVP
Thank you, Lewis. As Lewis indicated, a very important factor in the company's return to profitability has been a focus on cost reduction and cost
containment measures. Many of these initiatives began almost a year ago, pre-COVID-19 crisis and continued through the current year. Many of
these things focused on the integration of recent acquisitions and the extraction of those synergies, reduction in force, furlough activity, close
management of marketing and sales expenses. And we've also benefited from certain government subsidies in the foreign jurisdictions.

With the continued economic uncertainty, the company is continuing to pay -- closely monitor the overhead infrastructure to ensure that it's
appropriate based on the current level of commercial activity. This is something that the company is committed to, to ensuring that our profitability
remains.

Additionally, we closely monitor the capital structure to ensure we have sufficient liquidity available to fund any business opportunity that may
arise. So very closely monitored on ensuring that not just the top line growth is taking place, but that we are very carefully managing the infrastructure
of the organization.

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Enos, thank you very much. One of the areas that is a hard area for all companies is the Internet. I can tell you, Leonard, who's the President, has
been working very hard on the marketing and management of our general sales growth on a continuing basis, and he's here 7 days a week. And
I'm going to turn this over to Leonard now to speak on the Internet and some of our other activities. Leonard?

Leonard Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - President & Director
Thank you. The growth of the e-commerce business is not surprising to anyone. It's arising in virtually every nook and cranny of the retail world.
The difference for us versus the generalist is that we are tied in to multiple interconnected locations throughout the country, so we're winning on
both fronts. Our goal ultimately is to be wherever the customer chooses to shop. People right now are deferring on vacation decisions. They are
deferring on any sort of travel whatsoever. So as people are trapped in their homes, staring at the same walls and floors, the paint industry and the
flooring industry have really benefited from that as people continue to pour resources into their single largest asset. We don't expect this to change
whatsoever. We think that the e-commerce shift is here to stay, and we are working on many tactical levels to ensure that we are at the leading
edge.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Thank you very much, Leonard. I appreciate it. I want to give more color to the cost side and the integration side of our business as we go forward.
We had a very large program going on to integrate the Kraus structure with the QEP structure and also, at the same time, are using our system to
get more information out, and this was a year project and probably $1 million in cost. We've just about to see the end of the tunnel right now. Our
integration and testing went well over the last few weekends for the Kraus entity, and we now have visibility in there.

Our accounting software, which we've looked at very carefully, has been upgraded. We've made a lot of significant opportunity -- significant
investments in that. So that was part of our capital improvement in the prior year. On the real estate part of our business, we're trying to get a
smaller footprint just generally. We're looking to see if it's possible to sell our existing facility in Calhoun and merge our Dalton and Calhoun facilities
into something that's larger in that area. As a result, we've hired Cushman & Wakefield to sell our major property in Calhoun, which we bought.
We're very tight on room just generally all over the United States.

On an international basis, we believe that the profitability that we have is going to increase with new customer base. Our subsidiary in Germany
for the first time has turned profitable. And we continue to monitor that on a growing basis. We're very pleased, just generally, but we recognize
the threats that we all have. If something happens in China, it will affect everybody. We have resourced a lot of the product to Taiwan. The problem
is you can get the same product in Taiwan, but it's 40% more. And we're looking all over the world on a regular basis to do that. But I do want to
tell you, we've shed 200 employees at least. We're lean and mean now as we go forward. Our overheads have been reduced. The insurance companies
have made life difficult, and there's insurance increases everywhere, whether it's our D&O insurance, our general liability insurance, et cetera. We're
now past those this year. And next year, probably it will become even more difficult.

Our other costs, which are major costs, the health insurance cost, we've absorbed a small amount of that. And I think we have terrific coverage for
our employees and the exit of the CCA process will generate significant monies. We're spending a fortune right now on lawyers and monitors and
things like that. But probably, it will be well worth it when we're all over. That's part of the cost of doing business. But our product lines are refreshed.
Our customer prospects are quite good all over the world. And we're constantly looking for opportunities almost everywhere.

Now the last thing I want to say is on the COVID-19. In Palm Beach County, where we are in the office, there's -- now we're in Phase 3. We're quite
careful. There are masks. We have Cintas doing the cleaning every day. We have put up polyglass between a lot of the offices. We have the 6-foot
apart. The bathrooms are cleaned 2 times a day, et cetera. And so far, knock on wood, in all the plants that we have throughout the United States,
we sometimes use thermometers, people who are ill go home and are forced quarantine for 14 days before they can come back and retested.
We've had a minimal number of people and very little interruption as we go forward. Our plants, we're starting to get -- dig into the overhead on
the plants as the volume go up, especially in the Harris Wood plant, we seem to be doing a lot better. And our body count is down just about
everywhere we look throughout the world.

So saying that, what we'd like to do is turn this over to the wonderful people who represent our shareholders and advisers and see if we can answer
any of the questions that you may have. So Chantal, go ahead.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Dennis Reiland, Private Management Group.

Dennis Allen Reiland - Private Management Group, Inc. - Portfolio Manager, Founder, President & Secretary
Terrific quarter. Nice to see. Could you talk about the trend in the quarter as far as June, July, August, what were the trends in? I mean you mentioned
September a record month. So how was it during the months of the actual quarter itself?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
The month turned out to be a good mix. The mix made a difference. If you noticed, buried in our press release, our gross margin has gone up, which
is very hard. I have to give Leonard credit for that as we've discontinued a lot of the low margin items and substituted higher quality items at a
higher margin.

What has happened is -- were -- our shipping rates continue to go up. And there's been a switch. We've picked up some new customers, some
famous customers where there's additional volume for the first time that we haven't had before. And that's making a difference, both in South
America and on the American side. And certainly, on the international division, wow, I got to give these guys a lot of credit. They seem to be doing
a bang-up job. Just generally, their sales were up almost 12% year-to-year, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, which makes the difference.

Now we have a lot of initiatives that we're waiting for right now. And we believe that besides the unfortunate hurricanes and fires that are occurring,
the remodeling will have an effect on us. I've noticed that in the commentary from Mohawk and several others that they think will be on the right
side. So finally, we arrived, I believe, that we have the right products. We're in the installation part of the business. When -- [designer] part of the
business. And now finally, we've gotten Kraus right, and we're now on the dealer side of the business. So the numbers are falling in the proper way,
and we have a lot of -- we've made a lot of investment in people this quarter, and we hope to see the -- we're already 1/3 into the new quarter, so
let's go and we're giving up sleep to make sure this is going to be a pretty good quarter.

Dennis Allen Reiland - Private Management Group, Inc. - Portfolio Manager, Founder, President & Secretary
Just to follow up there. What were the CCA costs in the quarter? And how long do you expect this to last? And do you have an appraised value on
the Calhoun property?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Yes, we have. Our first CCA process, the cost range from $100,000 to $150,000 a month. It's been going on for several months, not particularly
pleased with it. But legally, the amount of paperwork and the stuff they generate and the legal opinions are there. We expect to exit the CCA the
second week in October, is that correct?

Unidentified Company Representative
End of October.

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
End of October. And then these onetime costs will stop. And there's just nothing we can do about these. These are charges that have to be paid,
whether they're court fees or anything else.

And when you -- in Canada, it's extremely difficult on the employment side of life. You have to have good counsel and you have to have the core
protection to do this.

Now regarding the appraised property in Calhoun. The company is part of the Kraus purchase, purchased the property for, I think, about $1.9
million roughly 18 months ago. And we have it currently listed at $4.2 million. We recognize that, that may be a more difficult obstacle for us. But
if nothing else, there seems to be a shortage of property in the Calhoun, Dalton area and maybe go on to bid, someone will make an offer that we'll
certainly consider.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We need time to adjust our footprint in that area, and we have to have some place to go. So we thought we would do is we started a little bit on
the high side and come down. The actual appraisal was an old appraisal that we had. I think the appraisal was about pretty much just a little bit
more than what we paid for at the time. So we're essentially -- we're going to double. The building needs some work, but we use it 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. So we're just not ready. If we do sell it or lease it, it would be an event that would not happen immediately. It would probably be a
6-month event.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from Jamie Wilen, Wilen Management.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
Just want to follow-up on the earlier question about sales. Just the progression, June, July, August and September. Can you give us some flavor
for how things have progressed May, June, July? Is it just kind of a straight-line upward? Is that what's happening?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
It appears that way because as the -- as companies start to go back to work, as you know, the remodeling sector and the home improvement
business is generally the big boxes, are showing record numbers. That's not hurting us at all. So what it looks like right now is if the virus continues,
people are going to be locked in the homes, obviously. That's good for us. So I think we're okay in a short period of time.

In a long period of time, I truly don't know. I don't think anybody knows. But right now, our visibility for this quarter seems to be quite good and
satisfying. And it is going up on a regular basis, month-over-month. We're probably 10% to 15% over the prior month. Got our fingers crossed. And
let me tell you, we are pushing, Jamie, to make this happen. Whether it's the Internet that Leonard mentioned briefly, our overseas sales are doing
quite well. Our South American sales are booming with -- we're all -- every aspect of our business and just about every business unit that we have
is doing well.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
Got you. Historically, seasonally, is September your strongest month of the year?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
No. It's generally 1, 2, 3, 4. It was supposed to be slow now and slowed down in the fourth quarter. But a lot of surprises. So if we had the first month
locked in and 2 months to go, it's too early to see what October looks like. But we do have a significant backlog to ship no matter what happens.

Leonard, will have to compliment, has been working on the company for a year. On the wood side of the business, we got a $0.5 million order a
couple of days ago. We have to make it and ship it. And we seem to be on the right track.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
Okay. Well, let me go toward the wood flooring business. I mean with the tariffs in China and the difficulties they've had, it's nice to pick up a new
customer, but are we on one shift now? Are we running efficiently? Are there other opportunities to be had in this business since we are, I believe,
the largest domestic producer?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
I'm not sure if we're the largest. There's some pretty good guys out there. However, the building that it's in, in Johnson City, Tennessee, we also
make sponges. We made around, I think, 12 million sponges last year out of that building. We do a lot of packaging. We do some other things out
of that. But the actual wood business is recovering because we have some large OEM customers. And we've hired some people that really know
the business. Some new people who have been here just in the last couple of months, that will represent good opportunities for us with domestically
produced wood.

For some reason, the Chinese, no matter what happens at tariff, the pricing seems to stay pretty much the same. But as you know, it could change
overnight. But in the meanwhile, we're getting more traction every month on the wood side of our business, for sure.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
And then lastly, on the cost reduction. I mean huge numbers, huge reductions in sales and marketing expenses. Are all these things permanent?
Within the new cost structure, what -- when you look out to your business once all these are instituted, and we had a reasonable level of sales,
what's a reasonable operating margin target to look for in the new QEP?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Well, first, I can tell you that we've invested in people. We've added on a significant number of senior people in the last month, especially in the
marketing and sales area. We recognize that. People who are much higher level than myself who know the lay of the land. As far as our operating
margin, a lot of that depends on the sales as we absorb the overhead. But we're selling higher-margin items than we ever did before. And I think
what we've done in this quarter, you might see repeated, possibly in the next quarter. I'm very confident that as long as these sales stay at these
levels, we're going to be in good shape. And I hope to tell you even more good stories in the next quarter.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
Okay. And then with the exit in Canada, you said a minimum of $3 million to $7 million. Is that a one-shot savings? That's not an annual event, I
assume.

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
That's an annual event. I wish it was a one shot. But this will continue. What we're doing is we cut back our overhead and operations in Canada and
essentially moved to the eastern part of Canada to operate out of a facility, which is well priced for us, and technically, Mississauga. And all the
functions that we had in Canada will reside on the Kraus side of the business there.

We also have another company in Toronto area, which is the traditional QEP and sells the big boxes and does manufacturing adhesives, et cetera.
And they're separate corporations. And as you know, so most of the savings will occur on the Kraus side of the business. We're rightsizing it, and
we did that for a lot of reasons. If you recall, we did this for customer concentration reasons, et cetera.

However, we've made good progress in that. We've hired some professionals that are running that side of the business, and we're pleased to see
that.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
So have any of these savings actually showed up on the income statement? Or they'll all occur after we exit the CCA?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
No, no. Where we used to have significant losses on a month-to-month basis, because of the government support and the people that are on
furlough, we're now probably at breakeven, and we're not having those losses. When we get out of the CCA, what will happen is those extra costs
that we had will disappear permanently.

James R. Wilen - Wilen Investment Management Corp. - President and Chief Compliance Officer
Got you. Okay. And the last thing, Lewis -- you mentioned that in South America, we've picked up 2 of the largest home center chains. I have no
idea how large home center chains and how dominant they are in South America, but could you tell us how many stores that would represent?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Leonard?

Leonard Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - President & Director
Approximately 400 big box stores across 6 countries.

Operator
Our next question will come from [Gary Winston], private investor.

Unidentified Participant
Great quarter. Great 6 months. You spoke about Australia still being shut down. And when you say shut down, is it just there's no business being
conducted there? How are we being affected in Australia from the shutdown?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Okay. The shutdown was residential where people cannot leave their homes, I understand, for a couple of hours of exercise. This was reimposed
again a couple of weeks ago. And I believe that it will continue for a few more weeks. However, the building material section or side of the business
with the big boxes are still in business, and we still ship those people. Also, we have the Internet, et cetera, and the other business that we have
there is the supply business for the installers. The installers are still part of the business and that has stayed.

In addition to that, we have received some government support, helping us with the people that are on furlough, et cetera. Although a lot of the
support probably will go away, for the foreseeable future right now, we're comfortable seeing that. Our Managing Director, Bruce, told me he's
becoming an alcoholic or he's going to go through a divorce if this continues. However, we're working with our largest customer, the 400-store
chain down there, and we're praying that good things happen with the new presentations that we've made.

And so when I say shutdown, people can't go out, but the supply side of the business, the Internet side of our business and supplying the big boxes
that are open is still available to us.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Participant
So in terms of contraction in the business there, can you put a percentage on how the shutdowns affected us?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
We're going to find that number, but it's very small. The profit has gone up, the sales have gone down because of the effect of the furloughs and
the layoffs that we've had. So even at a lower sales figure, which it hasn't been in the last, actually 6 months, it's only been recent, we've become
actually more profitable.

In fact, as a sidelight, our Australian subsidiary sent us $350,000 last week, which made us all happy, as part of the payback of our invested capital.

Unidentified Participant
The productivity gains that you've been able to achieve cutting -- cut...

(technical difficulty)

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
I think we lost you.

Unidentified Participant
I said the productivity gains that you're enjoying, your costs are going down, your people count is going down, your revenue is going up, is that
primarily driven by Leonard's initiatives using Internet marketing?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Internet marketing is one of the components of what we do, and the answer to that is yes. But the other things that we do, the other initiatives
worldwide has helped all of our divisions worldwide. Wherever they are, everybody is starting to make money.

So as we consolidate, our comprehensive income continues to go up. We've even made money in Germany, as I mentioned briefly.

Unidentified Participant
I know we had some losses. Have you had discussions with your CPAs with how the CARES Act and the ability to carry back net operating losses to
free up tax refunds from years 2014 forward? Do you have an idea of how that's going to impact us positively?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
I'm going to put Enos on and let him tell you.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Enos Brown - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - SVP
In the United States, we have carry back losses that was made available through recent legislation changes. We currently have a receivable from
the IRS, which we expect to collect in the near term. And that's slightly in excess of $1 million.

Unidentified Participant
I'm sorry, you cut out. Slightly in excess of $1 million?

Enos Brown - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - SVP
$1 million, which will go towards straight to additional liquidity availability.

Unidentified Participant
Got it. So we -- in your opening comment, Lew, you mentioned that we've paid off about $18 million of debt, and it would appear that we have
another $25 million or so to go in order for the company to be debt free. With your expectation that next year might be as rosy as this year, what
would you anticipate using your cash flow in the upcoming 12 months? How much would that go to debt versus human capital versus other uses?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
We're going through the budget process right now, although our new year doesn't start for 5 months. And we're looking at it very carefully because
several of the shareholders have said, can you pay us a dividend? We have investment in people. We have, moving around, as I told you, a little bit
on the real estate. I'll be able to realistically give you some hard numbers.

What we're saying is, though, right now, if we continue the process, we should have our debt paid down significantly as long as business stays on
a modest level because no one likes debt and -- except the banks, I think, and all the banks who are on the call. So just pulling everybody's leg. We
would like certainly to pay debt down because our liquidity has never been, as far as I can remember, I don't think we've had this large liquidity.
Am I correct, Enos?

Enos Brown - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - SVP
It is at the highest level since our provision.

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
They're in the highest level. Our liquidity is about $25 million ballpark figure right now.

Unidentified Participant
Yes. It's just astonishing the amount of debt that the company was able to pay off. In terms of just the market going forward, I mean, my understanding
-- I've been with you now 17 years. And back in the day, it seems like a lot of our business was driven by the remodel market. But in our recent
discussions, you've indicated that a lot of the business -- new business is coming from the construction boom. And do you have a feel for how
much new housing starts contributes to our business versus the remodel market?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
The remodel market is absolutely on fire. But the new homes are probably, I don't want to say bond burner with the fires in California, but the new
homes -- our OEM cheaper product going and the remodel stuff is what we really want and remodeling right now seems to be boom time. You've
got to -- when you're looking at the floor all day long, you've got to change it. And there's been a shift recently. The cheapest of the LTV and the
SPC people starting to look to upgrade, hopefully, to wood and engineered wood, which is us, if you will.

So we see that. Every report says remodeling. Look at the home centers, they're booming on the remodeling side. That's us. Globally, worldwide,
whether it's in England, whether it's in Australia, whether it's in Germany, whether it's Canada or the United States, that's us.

[Gary], I'm not sure if you got that.

Unidentified Participant
I'm sorry, do we have contracts with major homebuilders? Is that how we participate in that market for new construction?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
No. It's sold through distribution in most cases. And we have a strong distribution area, which has been our traditional Roberts business. And the
distributors primarily sell a lot of the homebuilders because as they complete a home, they need 1 floor, et cetera. Some of the OEM larger businesses
we do have, for example, as a separate discussion in Canada, we have several million dollars of backlog for flooring that going -- that's the Canadian
Kraus operation. In the United States, we don't. In the United States, it's more remodel.

Unidentified Participant
So with Leonard's Internet initiatives, are we hoping to cut out some of the middleman in -- on the distribution side to the builders themselves?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
I don't think we necessarily want to cut out our customers. But at the end of the day, we need to make sure that our products are available for end
users wherever the end user chooses to shop, and we're going to make that happen.

Unidentified Participant
And what part of our sales currently are going through the Internet? And what's your expectation over the next year or two?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
I could tell you that our global e-commerce sales are extremely robust. It's a growing percentage of our business, and we expect it fully to continue
to grow. I don't know if it will be the same pace as these last few months, but evidently, consumer shopping paradigm has completely shifted. So
there's only going to be more, not less of this. And we are preparing ourselves to be ready for that.

Unidentified Participant
And is that where a lot of the hiring of sales and marketing folks? Are they going to be part of that process? Is that what you're targeting those
people (inaudible)?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
There's some of that. I mean, honestly, we are doubling down on 360-degree photographers and videographers and YouTube commentators and
that whole piece is now expected from any serious company out there. So we are truly embracing the new world. The world is different, and we're
acting different.

Unidentified Participant
Got it. Congratulations on that. I mean it seems to be the way of the world. I have one last question, then I'll jump out.

So the anticipated sale of our property that you're hoping to get $4 million for, what are the synergies that you hope to achieve when you move
both operations into a larger facility? What are you going to be able to do that you can't do now?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
We're going to have less shippers, less computer terminals, less insurance and more (inaudible) and more bundling of products. It will all be together
where we produce in one area and ship it to another area to ship, et cetera. So that's our master plan. And we're doing it carefully. So it's not going
to happen overnight. We're not ready to lower the price yet.

Unidentified Participant
And then how's the adhesive business in Phoenix going?

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
We've downsized the operation in Arizona. We -- for a variety of reasons. The adhesive business in Arizona is probably okay. It's not declining. It's
getting better all of the time. And we're aggressively looking for new customers out there. It's more expensive for us to produce on the West Coast
and the East Coast because, for example, we use Georgia clay that has to be trucked there. And we're not prepared right now to lower the price to
get more business. We're happy with the numbers that are being generated currently.

Operator, if there are no other questions, just a couple of closing comments. Does anybody have any more questions?

Operator
At this time, we have no further questions in the queue.

Lewis Gould - Q.E.P. Co., Inc. - Executive Chairman
Okay. Two things, I just want to say one of our investors, [Richard Hicks], sends great vitamins. He calls me every day as a shareholder to make sure
I'm alive, and his investment is good. So for [Mr. Hicks], I'm here.

Second thing is regarding the trading. We are on the pink sheets right now, and we've discovered that there was a new SEC regulation that went
into effect several months ago, which said that in order to be at the next highest level and not shown as a risky company, you would have to show
the financial notes and almost have a whole variety of things posted that we never had before. The company is looking into this right now with its
auditors and its attorneys to see if we can upgrade the listing that we have because there are some restrictions.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I try to buy some more stock, and I'm not a seller, I'm a buyer. And I had to go to someone else because it was listed as risky. We're going to fix that.
It's not going to happen tomorrow. It's going to be a little bit expensive for us. But that's going to probably help all of us as we go forward.

The only other thing I wanted to say is we have the support and we're very pleased with our directors. Our employees have done wonders,
considering the virus. We're voluntary to come into the office. There's been an awful lot of voluntary folks coming in just about everywhere. And
the management team that we have is starting to gel.

As you've heard, we're disseminating more information. And we're very pleased to say that our cash flow is increasing every day. We're very pleased
with it. We've had no large losses of anybody going out of business on us, although we have the usual stuff that goes on from time to time.

So I think where we are is I wish I could give some visibility what it looks like towards the end of the year. I think it's good on a personal level. On a
business level, as long as things keep going this way, we'll have -- it will be a pleasure to have a conference call. The last few ones before this, I was
a little nervous about. But let me thank all of you. Let's hope that we have some peace and political peace that the President, whether you like him
or not, gets better and the stock box goes up, and QEP doubles in book value. So we'll do all of those things as we possibly can.

Let me say thank you, and God Bless America. See you in the next quarter.

Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference call has now concluded. You may disconnect your phone lines, and have a great
weekend. Thank you.

PRESENTATION
Gregory G. Zikos - Costamare Inc. - CFO & Director
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Costamare Inc. I am Gregory Zikos, Chief Financial
Officer of the company.

At this time, I call the meeting to order. I would like to introduce our General Counsel and Secretary, Anastassios Gabrielides, who will act as
moderator and secretary of the meeting. Anastassios?

Anastassios Gabrielides - Costamare Inc. - General Counsel & Secretary
Thank you, Mr. Zikos. There are 2 items of business on today's agenda: one, the election of one Class I Director to hold office until the annual meeting
of stockholders in 2023 and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified; and two, the ratification of the appointment of our independent
auditors. We will conduct the meeting in accordance with the rules of procedure that have been made available to you through the virtual meeting
platform.

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce the directors and officers of the company who are present: Mr. Zikos has already introduced
himself; Mr. Vagn Lehd Møller, Director; and Mr. Konstantinos Zacharatos, Director, are attending the meeting. The Board of Directors has appointed
me, Anastassios Gabrielides, or any one of my designees to act as inspector. For this annual meeting, I have designated Konstantinos Tsakalidis to
act as inspector.

Many stockholders have already submitted their proxies. All proxies will be voted as you have marked them. If you have voted by proxy, you do
not need to do anything at the moment. If you wish to vote during the meeting, however, you will be able to do so by following the instructions
on the virtual meeting platform.

The Board of Directors set the closure of business on August 14, 2020, as the date of record for this stockholders' meeting. We have, at hand, a
record of the holders of common stock as of that date. A duplicate record has been on file at the office of the company for the last 15 days, available
for inspection by any stockholder at any time during usual business hours.

I have been advised by the inspector that as of the record date, there were 121,344,869 shares of common stock entitled to vote at the annual
meeting and that immediately prior to the commencement of the meeting, the holders of 96,582,481 shares of common stock, representing 79.6%
of the company's issued and outstanding shares as of the record date, are represented by proxy at today's meeting. Holders of the company's Series
B preferred stock, Series C preferred stock, Series D preferred stock and Series E preferred stock are not entitled to vote on the items of business
on today's agenda. Since the majority of the company's share of common stock is represented here today, a quorum is present, the meeting is duly
constituted and the business of the meeting may proceed.

The Notice of the Meeting, the affidavit of mailing of notice and the proxy material will be inserted into the minute book of the company. The polls
for each matter voted on this meeting have opened at 3:00 p.m. Central European Time today, October 2, 2020. If you wish to vote during the
meeting, you may do so by following the instructions of the virtual meeting platform.

Turning to the first item of business today. The first item is the election of Class I Director to hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders
in 2023 and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. As set forth in the proxy statement accompanying the Notice of Annual Meeting,
the company's Board of Directors nominated Konstantinos Zacharatos for election as Class I Director to hold office until the annual meeting of

                                                                                                                                                                             
 stockholders in 2023 and until his successor has been duly elected and qualified. There have been no stockholder nominations properly filed with
the secretary of the company in advance of the meeting as provided by the bylaws. Accordingly, the nominations are hereby closed.

Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share registered in their names. The director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. If you
wish to vote during the meeting, please do so now by following the instructions on the virtual meeting platform.

(Voting)

Anastassios Gabrielides - Costamare Inc. - General Counsel & Secretary
I note that no questions have been submitted with respect to the voting or the election of the director. So I therefore move to the next matter
which is being submitted to stockholders for action, namely, the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young (Hellas) Certified Auditors
Accountants S.A. as the company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020.

The Audit Committee has worked closely with Ernst & Young over the past year and has found their work to be of the highest quality. Accordingly,
the Board recommends that stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as the company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2020. Representatives from Ernst & Young are present and available to respond to any appropriate questions later in the meeting.

If you wish to vote during the meeting, you may do so by following the instructions on the virtual platform. Approval requires the majority of votes
cast.

(Voting)

Anastassios Gabrielides - Costamare Inc. - General Counsel & Secretary
I note again that no questions have been submitted with respect to voting on the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor. As
there are no questions or proposals, the polls are now closed on each matter voted upon at this meeting as of 3 -- 7 minutes past 3, today, October
2, 2020. We will now address briefly any questions for management.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Anastassios Gabrielides - Costamare Inc. - General Counsel & Secretary
I note that no questions have been submitted for management at this time.

Moving on to the voting results. I have been advised by the inspector that the nominee for director has received the plurality of the votes entitled
to vote for such nominee. Accordingly, Konstantinos Zacharatos has been elected as Class I Director to hold office until the annual meeting of
stockholders in 2023 and until his successor has been fully elected and qualified. I have been further advised by the inspector that the majority of
the votes were voted in favor of the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young (Hellas) Certified Auditors Accountants S.A. as the company's
independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. Konstantinos Tsakalidis, in his capacity as inspector, will furnish the secretary
with a written report of the final vote count with respect to matters voted on today, which will be included in the minutes of the meeting.

Seeing that no further business has been brought before the meeting, the meeting is now adjourned. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much
for participating and see you at next year's annual meeting.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the VYNE Therapeutics Physician Symposium on AMZEEQ and ZILXI. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this webinar
recorded, and a replay will be made available on the VYNE Therapeutics' website following the event. We will be conducting 2 question-and-answer
sessions during the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). Before we begin the presentation, let me remind you that some of the information
on this webinar as well as the release issued this morning by VYNE contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. There are further details here on Slide 2 as well as the company's filings with the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to
your host, Dave Domzalski, President and Chief Executive Officer of VYNE Therapeutics. Please go ahead, Dave.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Sara, and good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us for this event. We're
excited. We have a lot to cover. Today is another exciting day for our company here at VYNE. We announced earlier this net that we officially are
launching ZILXI, our top minocycline foam product, 1.5% concentration of that product that is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions
associated with rosacea for adults. So we are officially launching the drug today. We're excited about this, and I know Matt and the team will talk
more about it throughout the course of our discussion today. So a big day for our company. For -- in terms of the agenda, I have a few opening
remarks, then I'll turn it over to Matt Wiley, our Chief Commercial Officer, that can talk about how we're progressing with the launch of AMZEEQ.
And then from there, we'll turn it over to 2 dermatologists that can provide their experience since AMZEEQ has been launched, Dr. Ted Lain and
Dr. Julian Moore. We'll open it up and for a Q&A session for all of the panelists.

From there, then we'll save way into a review of our commercial strategy and the market opportunity for ZILXI, and Matt Wiley we will cover that.
And then we'll have a presentation on the data that we have for ZILXI from Dr. Linda Stein Gold. We'll open it up again then for a Q&A session for
all the panelists, and then I'll wrap it up with some closing remarks. So as I shared, we're very, very fortunate to have 3 highly-accomplished
dermatologists that are joining us for today's session. So if we can just turn to the next slide.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 First, that will be joining us is Dr. Ted Lain. Dr. Lain's Board -- sort of dermatologist, Chief Medical Officer at Sonova, Dermatology in Austin, Texas.
He has a joint medical and masters degrees from Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University and specializes in diagnosis and treatment of skin
disorders and hair disorders, and is a physician trainer for Allergan on BOTOX Cosmetic, JUVEDERM, and VOLUMA. We then can move to next slide.

We're also very fortunate to have with us, Dr. Julian Moore, also Board-certified dermatologists at Hollywood Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery
Specialists in Hollywood, Florida. Assistant Director of the Larkin/Nova Southeastern University Dermatology Residency Training Program. Has his
doctorate in medicine from New York College of Osteopathic Medicine, a post doctoral NIH fellowship in Dermatology and Cutaneous Malignancy
at Mount Sinai,Icahn School of Medicine.

And then lastly, if we move to the next slide, we have joining us, Dr. Linda Stein Gold, who's the Director of Dermatology and Clinical Research at
Henry Ford Healthcare System in Detroit. She is the division Head of Dermatology at Henry Ford Health System. Has her medical degree from
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, very active in a variety of clinical research areas and for various dermatologic conditions. Is the
treasurer of the National Acne and Rosacea Society and also a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation Medical Board.

So again, thank you to Dr. Lain, Dr. Moore and Dr. Stein Gold for joining us today. We look forward to your comments and discussion and then the
question-and-answer session. So if we turn to the next slide. This has been quite a year of milestones for our company VYNE Therapeutics. As you
know, we just changed the name of the company just about a month ago. If we look back over the last 12 months, it's been quite an active year
for our company. With the initial approval of AMZEEQ back in October of last year, so almost a year ago, then subsequent NDA filings for ZILXI, the
merger with Menlo Therapeutics, the subsequent launch of ZILXI in January of this year. The eventual approval of ZILXI in May And then in June,
there is positive results from FCD105, a combination product of minocycline and adapalene, had a successful capital raise on the heels of that Phase
II data.

And then obviously, it brings us to our point today, which is the launch of ZILXI. We also have scheduled our end of Phase II meeting for FCD105
later this quarter. So if we move to the next slide. Again, it's been a great year for us despite the fact that we're all navigating through unprecedented
times with the pandemic around the globe. Despite that, we're very proud of the achievements that we've accomplished as a company. And as
we look forward, our priorities as an organization are very focused. Obviously, we are in execution mode on the launches of both AMZEEQ and
ZILXI. We intend to continue to press the trial utilization of AMZEEQ, and continue to gain market share. And Matt will talk more about that today
and some of the activities that we have ongoing as well as the underlying metrics that we're very encouraged to see. We are excited to leverage
our operational infrastructure and our sales force, which we believe is second to none out there in the area of dermatology now with our second
launch with our product ZILXI.

So we're going to focus on provider awareness over the course of the next several months and leverage the experience that physicians have had
with AMZEEQ and our molecule stabilizing technology to drive rapid experience and uptake for ZILXI. Obviously, for both these brands, AMZEEQ
and ZILXI, a key area of focus will be on payer acceptance and reimbursement. And then on the pipeline front, our most advanced asset is FCD105.
As I shared earlier, we had very, very positive results in the Phase II study earlier this summer. We believe it has the potential to be best-in-class
treatment if we replicate those results in the Phase III program. We have our end of Phase II meeting scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year.
And then we will hopefully embark on a Phase III program sometime in the first half of next year. We obviously have other products that we continue
to develop and move through the pipeline. But our focus certainly in the near-term is on executing on these launches while being very thoughtful
and prudent in managing our cash and operating expenses.

So if we move to the next slide. To sum up, as we think about buying as an investment thesis where we've morphed and have evolved over the
course of the last few years from really being a very small clinical-stage company to now a fully integrated specialty pharma/biotech company in
the dermatology arena. We're now a commercial based company. We have 2 products that we will be launching and are launching effective as of
today. Strong IP with patents to go out to 2037. And We're building a robust pipeline. We've got great synergies that we believe we can leverage
operationally and from a commercial infrastructure perspective, we've got a very experienced management team that's demonstrated that they
can launch products, they can develop and bring products to approval and launch them. And we believe we're capitalized as we've share with the
markets, our shareholders in the investment arena. We have $100 million in cash as of the end of the second quarter, and we believe that should
get us through the balance of 2021 as we continue to build our business and grow our products, market share.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So with that, I will now turn the meet over to Matt Wiley, our Chief Commercial Officer, that could take you through our commercial plans and our
underlying metrics for AMZEEQ. So Matt, take it away.

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, good morning to everyone. We can go to the next slide. I'll walk you through the original strategy, and you may
have seen a slide similar to this in previous presentations. But the commercialization strategy for AMZEEQ is predicated on these 4 key themes.
One is to position the product in a unique and ownable way. And I think that you'll see, as I take you through it, our story reflects that we want to
be able to mobilize consumers. And typically, 6 to 9 months after long after you've gotten a foothold in the market, you typically would deploy
DTC efforts. So I'll walk you through how we're approaching that as we're getting into Q4.

Efficient deployment. We've talked about this previously, but I'll walk you through the sales deployment model that we have and some of the
impact that we've had on our targets since launch. And then I'll take you through where we are with access to date. We go to the next slide. So
positioning is important. As we do monitor research, typically we look for attributes of a product that rise to the top. It's not surprising. I've seen in
diligence products that I've worked on over the years, where efficacy and safety typically rise the top, sometimes convenience does as well. And
as we look at the competitors in the acne space, we see a lot of these products that have their positioning, really focused in their message platform
focused on these 3 things. And while they're important attributes in market research, typically, they're not as ownable as something that's truly
unique to the brand. So as we think about our positioning, we want to make sure that we had a message that had good resonance and was very
bespoke to AMZEEQ.

So as we go to the next slide, you'll see this in our message platform. We have built out our story that's predicated on the fact that minocycline is
a known molecule. It's a trusted molecule that's been around for almost 50 years. We were able to use the molecule stabilizing technology which
is the cornerstone of our positioning, by the way, to overcome the challenges of getting this molecule into a topical formulation. And then, of
course, that leads to the fact that we have this brand AMZEEQ that is redefining topical therapy for inflammatory lesions in moderate to severe
acne. And then, of course, the balance of the presentation that we communicate on a daily basis runs through our efficacy parameters, our safety
profile, tolerability of the product, how to use the product effectively and the affordability components and tools that we have in place.

Next slide. So our reps clearly go out and make these calls every day using that message platform. We also use pure influence programs, speaker
programs to help communicate these messages as well. To date, we've had over 90 programs. Now a lot of these had to transition to virtual due
to the pandemic shutdowns. But we've made really good impact on health care providers. We've had over 1,200 attendees to date. In speaker
programs, we've had -- we have almost 400 estimated attendees that are going to attend future programs. And as you may recall, we had a satellite
symposium back in the first quarter where we had 338 total attendees. So the ambition here is to have educated over 2,000 health care providers
in 2020 on the AMZEEQ through peer programs.

Now as I mentioned, the consumer approach, typically you wait 6 to 9 months after launch. So you can get a good trial and good uptake of the
product with your health care provider targets. That has been impacted by COVID-19. And so we have pushed that out to Q4. But we've already,
in this -- in late September, increased our presence in search engine paid search term acquisition. We've also launched or are about to launch the
AMZEEQ Facebook and Instagram channels. And we're doing exploratory work with acne influencers on how we can build content for channels
such as YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, and to get real-life promotion presentations from those influencers in social media.

So how are we doing with the targeting model that we deploy, as you recall, we deployed 51 representatives that cover 2/3 of the acne diagnosed
patient population and about 3/4 of the total acne prescriber prescriptions. And one of the things that we've been able to accomplish here, 94%
reach on all of our targets we define our target like platinums and gold. So to the platinums, think of those as the highest decile physicians who
see the most patients and have the highest volume of prescriptions. We've reached that group to 99%, which is great. And then 93% of our gold
targets. Some targets just are not easy to see. And so this is a pretty good result, 9 months in, in a pandemic.

Next slide. So what is our penetration into these groups? Well, we've penetrated our target universe by over 50% year-to-date. And importantly,
we're over 60% in our Platinum group. Now the productivity of these, overall, if you look at total target productivity, it's over 18 prescriptions per
target and our platinum target generating over 27 prescriptions per target. Keep in mind that if a target had just written their first prescription,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 they were included in those averages. So these averages are weighted down by those that are coming on board. A part of our incentive compensation
plan for Q3 was predicated on getting targets who had not previously written to write, and we've seen a lot of physicians come on board since
that effort. And that's going to contribute to these numbers. But ultimately, as we continue to penetrate the market, we can count on at least 18
prescriptions per target and growth in there.

Next slide. So where are we with market access. To date, we have roughly 63% of covered lives under contract. We're still waiting on 1 outstanding
-- a PBM. And so that contract is in motion. It is with legal. However, it is not yet inked. And so we're looking forward to getting that last PBM under
contract. We feel like we've had great dialogue with them. But of that 37% that's not covered, 42 million of the 65 million lives in that bucket are
due to this 1 PBM contract. And so we are cautiously optimistic that we get to 80% or better of covered lives under contract by the end of this year.
So what's going on with the overall market in acne. These are branded new prescriptions, and I referenced these in other conference calls that
we've had. But as we think about where the prescription volume was on a weekly basis back in 2019 in September, October, where the market has
healed, too, it's just shy of that right now. It hasn't fully come back. Yet we have seen some continued growth over time. Obviously, there's the
Labor Day holiday in there for the most recent dip. But we expect to see that this market continue to heal over the balance of the year, and get
back to what we think will be on normal levels.

Next slide. One of the things that we're really proud of is how we've bounced back since the COVID-19 shutdown. So obviously, we're off to a very
good start through mid-March COVID-19 shutdowns happened into delayed late March, which impacted our growth through that month, but also
really impacted April. And so from that point forward, we've seen nice steady growth at about 20% compounded over the last 5 months.

Next slide. So this is a cumulative look at unique patients. And these are based on claims records. So this is -- these are unprojected or raw counts.
But based on these numbers, we have at least 36,000 patients that have now been on AMZEEQ since launch, and that's a really nice number.
Obviously, we do these things to help as many patients as we possibly can. So we're off to a great start, and we believe that we have hundreds of
thousands of patients to go. But it's good to see that we're making an impact on these patients' lives. And I think you'll hear more about that from
Dr. Lain's and Dr. Moore's presentations.

Next slide. One of the things that we do measure is how many unique prescribers we have actively prescribing the drug over time. And to date,
we have over 5,200 physicians or healthcare providers that have prescribed AMZEEQ at least once. And one of the things that's really impressive
is as we had to pivot during the COVID-19 shutdown period, we were able to continue to grow the exposure of the brand and continue to grow
the prescriber base over that period of time. Now that's a really important thing that we were able to do in that virtual time frame. Because as the
market comes back and as things get back to somewhat normal, where the throughput of the patients in the practice heals and our ability for reps
to go back and make details live in those offices also comes back. But these patients have been exposed, they've at least tried the drug. And so this
is a great thing to measure. We also measure how many unique prescribers are prescribing on a weekly basis. And we've seen anywhere between
1,300 to 1,400 unique prescribers on a weekly basis. So again, as the market comes back, that's a really important metric that we focus on every
week.

Next slide. One question that we get asked quite frequently is how many of our prescriptions are either new-to-market or refills or those that are
being switched or added to something else in the market. So this breaks that down for you. About 20% of our overall business launched to date
are patients who have been on AMZEEQ before. So that's -- those are refills. The new-to-market is right around 40%. And those that are either
switched to or added to something else is around 40%. And so when we break down the data that we have now, we don't have this broken down
specifically by just pure switching. But we have done a little bit of digging into this to help inform which of these products are being switched
versus which are being added to. It makes sense that most of the antibiotics are being switched from previous therapy to AMZEEQ. And then
products such as AKLIEF, EPIDUO FORTE, et cetera, we're surmising that that's being added to. There's ongoing analytics to break this down further,
but just wanted to give you this view for your edification.

Next slide. So this information is hot off the press. We have an awareness trial and usage study. We did a baseline back in Q4 of last year. We just
got this information a couple of nights ago that we were able to call here. So these are physicians who are in our called on universe. So they're in
our target universe and asked -- prompted whether they recognize or are aware of the products in the acne space. We can see that 88% of the
respondents knew AMZEEQ. And I think that's a pretty good response in our called on universe, not surprising with those numbers. Given the fact
                                                                                                                                                                             
 that we've been on the market for just 9 months and drugs like say, Seysara been out a year ahead of us, to have similar awareness in our target
group is a testament to our sales team and what they've been able to accomplish over the last 9 months.

Next slide. This is also from the same study. And so we ask, both in our baseline market research and in the most recent market research, what the
anticipated usage of products on the market are. And so in our baseline, you can see that drugs like Seysara, Altreno, et cetera, the anticipated
utilization on a go-forward basis was relatively high. And you can see that after AMZEEQ was launched, in the most recent wave that we've done,
the anticipated utilization of AMZEEQ is better than 50% on a go-forward basis. And you can see the products that we've displaced there. We're
encouraged by this. We anticipate that those physicians who are just dabbling with the product to begin right now, those targets that we've just
penetrated, their productivity is going to increase. And I think the numbers that I showed previously help support that, this market research supports
it as well.

So finally, next slide. What are we heading -- what are we focusing on as we get into 2021? Well, certainly, as it relates to our positioning, we want
to continue to focus on new patient acquisition, so NRx generation. We want to more deeply penetrate into the target universe that we've created.
We want to mobilize our consumers in a meaningful way in '21. So as we're going through our consumer mobilization efforts in Q4, there's a lot of
measurement that we will do to ensure that we are focusing on tactics that have meaningful impact on the market and mobilization, and we will
amplify those and put more resources behind those in 2021. Obviously, getting to our targets, and we're deeply penetrating not just the platinums,
but also the golds in 2021 as a top priority. And of course, finalizing the access ambition of having broad access for our patients so we can reduce
our reliance on denial conversion and synthetic access programs.

And with that, I'll turn things back to Dave. Thank you.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Matt. I really appreciate the updates. As you know, this event is a physician symposia. And the focus is really on what our physicians
experience been with AMZEEQ and it's review on ZILXI as I outlined when we kicked off the event is that we're really fortunate to have 3 physicians
from different parts of the country. Texas, Florida and Michigan that are widely published, done a tremendous amount of research, dissipation in
various clinical trials. But equally as important, I see a lot of patients and really can speak from their vantage point about how they treat patients
for these conditions. What are the products in the armamentarium? And then how do our products, AMZEEQ and ZILXI fit into that, not just today,
but their view on it in the future. So with that, I want to turn it over to Dr. Ted Lain from Austin, Texas. So without further ado, Dr. Lain, take it away.
Thanks.

Ted Lain
Thanks so much, Dave, and I appreciate being here. I hope I'm not in the silver group of that platinum and gold, I hope there's not a third silver
group. We'll talk about that later. So the AMZEEQ topical foam, 4%. I just wanted to give you the point of view of a dermatologist in the south. I
was also luckily involved in the Phase III trials. It was a principal investigator in the Phase III trials for AMZEEQ as well as ZILXI in the Phase II trials
for the novel combination product. So I'm well aware of both AMZEEQ and ZILXI as well as the pipeline for buying, and it's all very exciting.

Next slide, please. So obviously, this is not a CME accredited program. I am a consultant and receiving compensation for this presentation today. I
also have been a principal investigator and am a speaker for the company. Thank you.

Next slide, please. All right. So when I approach the acne patient, and I made this very personal, I'm not sure that Julian and Linda would agree with
how I approach, probably have their own approaches. But the first thing I think about with an acne patient is what do they want? Are they wanting
to get clear? Of course, all of us want our patients to be 100% clear. We know the psychosocial impact of acne, even 1 or 2 pimples has a deficit on
their quality of life. And so we strive for clear, but are the patients wanting to get to clear? And if they are, how much are they willing to do to get
to that endpoint? The other thing I think about is, how am I going to optimize the compliance for this patient? And of course, that varies from a
teenage boy to a teenage girl to an adult. And will they tolerate a retinization, for example, as we know a retinization is during those first 2 to 4
weeks of using a topical retinoid where you can get a redness, dryness inflammation. Will they tolerate the initial flaring that can accompany the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 a retinization? And then finally, if I think they would benefit from an oral antibiotic, will they take it for the 2 to 3 months that I think may be necessary
in order for them to see the full results. So we go through that as well. And then finally, my third goal is what is the reason for their acne? Is there
an inherent driver so for example, is it hormonal, if I'm talking to a later teenage girl or an adult woman? Is it primarily hormonal? If I'm looking at
adult male to see have sebaceous skin, in other words, does he just have genetically oily skin? Or is this truly just a bacterial overload like we're
talking about with commonly with the teenage boys, where there's a hormonal plus cutibacterium acnes infection. So really, I try and think about
what's the main issue that I'm trying to solve for here.

Let's go to the next slide, please. So when we look at the AAD acne management guidelines, you can see here, first-line is on the top left, right?
And then we have the severity of acne going across on the top, okay? When we look at the first line, you can see the topical combination therapy
for mild, including antibiotic plus BPO. When we go to moderate, antibiotic plus BPO, and we go to severe antibiotic plus BPO. So that's because
the antibiotic that we've had has -- or the antibiotics, I should say, that we had to use included clindamycin and erythromycin. But we know that
there's so much resistance on the part of cutibacterium acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. Where that's involved in the pathogenesis of acne, I
should say, that we've had to -- and combine them with Benzol peroxide, that's what BPO stands for benzoapyrene in order to reduce the resistance.
However, Benzol peroxide,can cause irritation. So there's downside to using Benzyl peroxide as well, not to mention bleaching of the coals, for
example.

Next slide, please. So when I start thinking about my acne patients, I was forced to think about my prescribing habits as I put together the slide
deck, which was actually quite insightful for me. And I realized the retinoids that I were using were really the new generation retinoids, right? I was
prescribing quite a bit of a quiet a bit of Aklief and Erazmo. I still hung my hat on Epiduo Forte, which again has the Benzyl Peroxide. And generically,
I was using a lot of -- I still am using quite a bit of tretinoin 0.05% cream. And then, of course, for those patients who would benefit, and I could --
and perhaps could not substantiate a prescription retinoid. The over the counter difference 0.1%, it would put different 0.1% gel at $15 to $18 is
just quite a margin for them. The non-retinoids, of course, AMZEEQ is at the top of the list. It's replacing a lot of the Aczone and Azelaic acid I was
using. And then, of course, we have the Benzyl Peroxide clindamycin combinations, which are also being replaced by the monotherapy AMZEEQ
as well. So systemically, the tetracycline class antibiotics continue to dominate. I tend to be transitioning much more to Seysara than from the
doxycycline and oral minocycline because of the narrow spectrum and the lack of systemic side effects that we see with Seysara, and then other
antibiotics are listed there. Spironolactone for its anti antigen effects, especially in the adult and later-aged teenage girls and women. And then
Accutane as necessary for the severe nodules cystic acne or that acne, which does not respond to inventional therapy. And finally, if I have somebody
who just really wants to try something different than the topical and oral medications we'll talk about the unconventional therapy such as Sebacia
or Blu-U plus or minus, photodynamic therapy. And of course, we also have peels and facials.

Okay, next slide, please. So in my algorithm, as I've already touched on, definitely replacing the single-agent clindamycin. I was moving away from
that anyway because of the resistance, it's also replacing Benzyl peroxide and clindamycin combination products. Aczone and absolutely, it's
delaying. We're absolutely replacing oral antibiotics, and then it helps to delay isotretinoin use as well, and I firmly believe that, especially if I feel
like a patient would benefit from isotretinoin, but we're in the middle of summer in Austin, it's really difficult to initiate an isotretinoin course in
the middle of summer. So if I can delay that until the fall or winter with a topical antibiotics such as AMZEEQ, I'm definitely going to do that to allow
my patients the benefit of taking isotretinoin during the fall and winter months when it's just much easier here.

Next slide, please. So what are the compelling factors of AMZEEQ? I've tried to think about this both in terms of with my MD as well as the MDA,
what are the compelling factors as we we talk to this audience. So we know that minocycline has taken internally has multiple possible side effects
and therefore, possible limitations as well and those are listed there. But we also know that tetracycline class antibiotics or anti-inflammatory. So
their use especially topically for acne (inaudible), it makes a lot of sense. We also see why ore ratio, for example, that low dose, slow release form
of doxycycline has done so well in rosacea because of its anti-inflammatory effect on that dose is not antibacterial. So we also have the AAD, the
American Academy of Dermatology kind of pounding on our doors that we need to have antibiotic stewardship. In other words, dermatologists
comprised 1% of all physicians that write 5% of all antibiotic prescriptions. So we know that we are overrepresented in terms of the number of
prescriptions we were right. And so we can reduce our prescription -- our systemic antibiotic prescriptions that would go a long way towards
antibiotic stewardship and the goal of our society. Finally, we're looking at the efficacy and tolerability trade-off. And historically, when we when
we think about topical medications, in particular, there is usually, if they have high efficacy, they're going to have poor tolerability and poor
tolerability by that, I mean, that could cause redness, scaling, dryness, stingy burning and itching. So if we can have topicals now that don't have
this trade-off that we're not on the teeter totter of efficacy and tolerability, that would solve a lot of issues for dermatologists and patients alike.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 We tried that with ACZONE 5% BID twice today and then ACZONE 7.5% once a day. And the efficacy was okay. It was the tolerability that I think
really drove the success of that product. But now we have pharmaceutical companies such as VYNE, who are coming out with either novel compounds
or novel formulations of existing compounds that allow us to really not sacrifice efficacy for the tolerability. And then the last point, we need to be
able to apply the medications to the face and trunc. There's some recent data that's come out showing that 60% to 70% of patients with acne on
their face also have acne on their trunc. And dermatologists historically have done a poor job at asking patients about their truncal acne. And yet
we know now from research that the truncal acne certainly has an impact on their quality of life. And therefore, it's incumbent upon dermatologist
nominally ask but also examined the cutback during an active visit. And to treat that. And we just haven't had really good compounds or good
data to show that we can treat the face chest and back. But with a phone formulation such as us with AMZEEQ, we really can now use 1 medication,
and therefore, 1 co-pay for the patient to treat the face, chest and back.

Next slide, please. Other compelling factors. We touched on this before. Numerous studies have showed community resistance to topical clindamycin.

And in fact, there was a study that came out in 2019 in the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology showing the resistance of P acnes to clindamycin
increasing 4% in '99 to 90.4% in 2016. And so if we look at just the number of clindamycin -- topical economic in prescriptions written, I think there
is an idea of what the market is for AMZEEQ. And so we'll show that in the next slide that again, we had to add the Benzyl peroxide to the clindamycin
to solve this resistance issue.

Let's go to the next slide, and it's quite illuminating, I think. So 6.9 million prescriptions written for clindamycin phosphate and erythromycin, okay,
generating over $1 billion in revenue. So if we think about just the opportunity for AMZEEQ to capture some of this monotherapy and topical
antibiotic, I think it's just huge. And I think the points that Matt made in terms of the number of speaker programs that have been given and the
number will be -- continue to give are going to be really important because it shows the science behind AMZEEQ in that speaker deck as well as
the efficacy without the tolerability trade-off. And so I think that it's just changing behavior and many doctors -- certainly, the topical cities
prescriptions may not all come from dermatologists. I personally hope they don't, and many of them may come from primary care doctors. The
primary care doctors will learn about AMZEEQ from dermatology colleagues and realize that it's a better option, in my view, then topical clindamycin
and erythromycin because of the resistance, so they just may not be aware of. Next slide, please. So when we think about IGA treatment success,
I think when you -- a topical antibiotic may not reach the IGA treatment success that you think others that we use may. And certainly, this has been
the case when I've given speaker programs that dermatologists have come in a little bit. Little bit skeptic of the IGA success of monotherapy
minocycline product. So here, we have 3 separate trials. Okay, this is not head-to-head. These are 3 completely separate trials. One is AMZEEQ, of
course, the minocycline foam 4%. The other one is a ARAZLO, this is tazarotene lotion, 0.045%. And AKLIEF, which is the trifarotene cream, another
retinoid focusing on the gamma receptor subside 0.05%. So what I wanted to show here is, of course, we're not comparing, you cannot compare
between Phase III trials. But I wanted to show each trial individually to see dermatologists will remember from 1 speaker deck to the next, 1
publication to the next. What that IGA success is. There's a number -- obviously, we remember 3 things from every lecture that we hear. Hopefully
you remember more than that from mine. But you'll remember 3 things. And so we remember 30% as an IGA success, when you look at ARAZLO
for example, 30%, you'll see that in some other Phase III publication, IGA success. Now what is IGA success?

Just to remind you, IGA success means achieving clear or almost clear on the investigator's global assessment. This is the investigator walking into
a room. Assessing the acne patient at a arm's length and giving their gestalt overview of the severity of the acne. Now every trial that we do has
their own IGA training. And so we have been well-trained in IGA, especially those of us who have been doing this for a while, have been well-trained
in IGA. And IGA baseline also plays a role. It's important to understand this because the AMZEEQ trials allow those with moderate and severe
patients. And so if you think about the hurdle that is needed to overcome in order to get cleared to almost clear, if you have a substantial number
of patients with an IGA of 4, which is a severe acne patient, okay? And they need to get to a 0 or 1, a clear or almost clear. That's a much larger
hurdle than for those that are only at an IGA of 3, okay? Or at a moderate.

So it's important to understand those trials that include those severe patients in those cows that don't when you were looking at the IGA success.
So I think here, again, not comparing trials. We can't compare trials unless there's a head-to-head. But what I'm showing here is the data from each
trial. And I just wanted to convey that yes, this 30% idea of IGA success brings through with AMZEEQ as it does for some of its contemporary
competitors. Okay. Next slide, please. Okay. A little bit of a chart here. So if I could just walk you through this. So FMX101 is, of course AMZEEQ. On
the left, that's the left set of 4 columns, and then the vehicle foam is the right set before columns. This is from the pivotal trials. And we're looking
at the tolerability assessments on the left-hand column, erythema, which is, of course, redness, dryness, hyperpigmentation, which is brown spots

                                                                                                                                                                             
 on the skin, skin peeling, which is literally as it says peeling of the skin, and itching as reported by the patient. So what we're showing here are the
to what we call the local tolerability assessment of the application of the either FMX101, the AMZEEQ or the vehicle foam. And you can see here,
the vast majority of patients had a rating of none in regards to how well their skin responded to AMZEEQ in the left-hand 4 columns and the vehicle
on the right-hand 4 columns. And you can see actually that in some cases, it looks like AMZEEQ numerically did even a little bit better than just the
vehicle by itself. So certainly, no safety signals that we see here with AMZEEQ versus the vehicle. And the vast, vast majority of ratings of these
adverse events for the local tolerability assessments were either mild or moderate. There's just very few severe the rating of 3 that you see for
FMX101, and the rating a 3 for the vehicle. They're very few severe, and certainly, that number is consistent between FMX and vehicle. So excellent
tolerability here. So as I showed before, we have the efficacy of about 30% achieving the IGA of clear, almost clear at week 12. And here, we have
excellent tolerability as showed in the local tolerability assessment. So we don't have that trade off, which is what we're all striving for in dermatology
and what is great for our patients of efficacy and tolerability.

Next slide, please. Okay. Patient selection. So where do I think that AMZEEQ fits in as I look at patients that I treat? So patients sensitive to side
effects. So teenage girls and adult women are notorious for -- especially changed girls if they get dry, they stop using. They absolutely just stop
using products. And even if you walk them through the reinization idea and you tell them to use a more straighter and you incorporate gentle
cleansing and you do everything you possibly can in the room to get them prepared for it, they will stop using it. Now you also have to think about
where we are right now with the COVID-19 pandemic and all of us wearing masks. I don't know if any of you have experienced any increase in acne,
rosacea or any kind of irritation underneath the mask. But certainly, if you're experiencing retinization, that redness dried as irritation, while wearing
a mass, it can amplify those symptoms and make it even harder. So that's something that I think about as well. Patients needing combination
therapy. Again, teenage girls and adult women because we often think about hormonal therapy that we need to deal with either with birth control
or spironolactone along with topicals. And then you have the third group of patients who -- they want to avoid systemic therapy. I mean, I live in
Austin, which is an area where many patients have adopted a lifestyle where they really try and keep it ""all natural"" and would like for me to treat
everything with essential oils. But really, if I even bring up a systemic antibiotic or systemic therapy that will kind of block in my face. So I really
need to be careful in choosing the right patient and giving them the options just to make sure that if it's in with their lifestyle and their choices.
Next slide, please. Okay. So I wanted to go through 3 patient examples, just to give you an idea and make it more real and tangible for you. This is
a 17-year-old female. I'm sure, Julian and Linda, my colleagues would agree with this type that we see these patients multiple times every day.
Mixed acne, in other words, meaning that she has both pimples as well as blackheads and whiteheads. Very anxious about her skin texture and
tone in particular. And as I mentioned before, this is a patient where you've got to be really careful with dryness because you'll most likely stop
using anything that makes their skin feel or look dry. She has anxiety about our acne and she scratches at or acne bunks to get rid of them. That
could lead to scaring. We also have to stop this pretty quickly, so she doesn't get more scaring, as you can see on her forehead, she's developing
scars on the on her left, your right. And she wears copious makeup in order to cover the acne. So this is a very typical teenage female patient in
our practice. So what will we look at? Well, of course, we're going to think about does she get worse around her menstrual cycle and we'll target
hormonal therapies, if not maybe an oral antibiotic in order to get things under control very quickly. But otherwise, I'm really focused on what I
can do to help alleviate her acne without causing the local tolerability side effects that could lead to her discontinuation and poor compliance.
And so this would be a patient where I'd either use AMZEEQ by itself or possibly combine it with ACZONE in the morning trying to avoid anything
that could cause drying. Now the nice thing -- next slide, please, and let me talk about some of the other nice things about the AMZEEQ. Here's a
32-year old woman. Again, an adult female coming in with acne that -- she'll come in and say, look, as a teenager, I had beautiful skin, and this just
started. And I don't understand why, and it's on my lower face. And yes, I'm covering it up by the mask because the mask is making the pimples
hurt worse because it rubs on them. I mean, this is a common story that we all here right now. She tried multiple over-the-counter treatment
options. She's gone to Sephora. She spent her $500 a month. And she just isn't getting anywhere. And so she comes in quite desperate, wanting
a fix now. So this is someone again that we may consider spironolactone or even a birth control pill to work on the hormones because usually an
adult woman when the acne comes up, there's a hormonal component. And then I'll talk about using a topical AMZEEQ, either morning or night.
Because again, she won't tolerate dryness either, and we have to be very careful with what we use. And if I can make her regimen easy, she'll
appreciate that even more. She's a busy 32 years old women, most likely a young mother. So we have some treatment considerations that we have
to think about in terms of the social impact for her kind of her lifestyle and what she'll be able to use as well. So AMZEEQ fits very nicely into this
patient population as well.

And the next slide, please. And then you've got this guy, right? You've got your average 15-year-old mail. Lots of pimples, lots of pus bumps, lots
of open and closed (inaudible). His mom is here with him, but his mom spreading over his acne, and he really couldn't care, right? We've seen these
patients as well. And many of you have either been this patient or maybe have this patient as your son? I certainly do. So this is a kid that doesn't

                                                                                                                                                                             
 care, but the mom will not let his skin look like this. And so then I've got to think about, okay, what am I going to do to get this kid clear? Because
whatever I do, he's going to -- it's got to be easy, if he will be compliant, but they'll also see results and make the mom happy as well. Well, I know
I'm going to need a retinoid is likely for this good because he has a lot of black heads and whitehead, okay? And retinoids do a really nice job with
that. And plus or minus benzoyl peroxide, I don't know, but a retinoid, for sure. So as I think about what can I pair with a retinoid to decrease the
dryness, certainly, I can use the cleansers and the moisturizers. But if we're all being real here, how often will a 15-year-old use a moisturizer?
AMZEEQ has in its -- in that canister, it's not only got the minocycline 4%, but it's also got coconut oil and soybean oil in it. So it's moisturizing as
well. So I know that we'll add some moisturizing components to this patient's regimen by using AMZEEQ in the morning, and it will allow me to
better tolerate the retinoid at night. So that, again, that's just what goes through my mind as I'm thinking about the treatment options of how I
can make sure not only do I get this get backing better, but that he'll tolerate it, be compliant and see results.

All right. Next slide, please. Okay. So here, we have a patient in the clinical trial. This is an IGA 4, severe patients, as I mentioned, remember that the
AMZEEQ pivotal trials included IGA of moderate and severe 3 and 4. So this is an IGA of 4 patient. You can see on the top, getting to a mild, okay?
So improvement from IGA 4 to IGA 2. So this would not be considered a clinical success, right, because we didn't hit clear, or almost clear. But if
you're talking monotherapy, 1 treatment -- one product, excuse me, that's the AMZEEQ, that's all she was on in the pivotal trials, of course, with
just the gentle cleanser moisturizer and sun screen. Getting her from an IGA of 4 award to an IGA 2, that is quite impressive, especially with a foam
formulation that is moisturizing as well. So it kind of not only helps with the acne, but it may also help repair some of the barrier defects that we
see with acne and moisturize the skin as well. And so we see here, as mentioned, that the IGA success, which, again, was clear or almost clear, you
can see in that paragraph just underneath the title, was 30.8% with the AMZEEQ. And the percent lesion reduction in terms of inflammatory lesions,
which are the pus bumps and the red bumps, the papules and pustules, was 43% for vehicle and 54% for AMZEEQ. So we have statistically significant
difference there in the reduction of inflammatory lesions as well.

All right. Next slide. Legal requirement here, just go over the important safety information or ISI. Of course, this is indicated in children 9 years of
age and older as we know that acne is tending to occur younger and younger children. So to have that 9 years of agent older indication is excellent
for the treatment of pimples and red bumps, non-nodular acne happen with moderate to severe acne in adults kids should not be used for the
treatment of infections. We talked about that in the speaker deck as well. It is not known if it's safe for children under 9 years of age as well. It
shouldn't be in patients who are allergic, women who are pregnant or who are trying to become pregnant, it has flammability because of the
propellants and so we talk to patients about not using it around a flame. And of course, they should protect their skin from the sun. And when
taken by mouth, minocycline may cause feelings of light headiness, dizziness or spin. We talked about how that is one of the limitations of systemic
antibiotics such as minocycline, are these systemic side effects on why AMZEEQ really is such a novel and great compound for us to have.

Okay. Next slide. I think that's the end of my presentation. I thank you very much.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Lain, for that comprehensive overview and your insightful thoughts on how you can treat patients and how AMZEEQ fits into your
armamentarium, so thank you, again, very much. And stand by, we'll bring you back in for Q&A in a little bit. So I want to turn it over now to Dr.
Moore from Florida, down to Miami area that I can share his experience and his perspective on how he assesses and treats patients and how AMZEEQ
fits into his treatment regimen. So without further ado, I'll turn it over to Dr. Moore.

Julian Moore
Excellent, Dave. Thank you very much. Do you hear me?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I can.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Julian Moore
Excellent, Dave. Thank you very much for that very comprehensive overview. So from the perspective of my presentation, I really want to so highlight
some of the patients in my practice, I think Dr. Lain did a fantastic overview of some of the studies and showed some of his clinical patients. And I
want to do a bit of the same and kind of just drive home some of the salient themes of how I use AMZEEQ and why it's important to me in my
practice. So our next slide, please. So just as some consultant disclosures, this isn't been hosted by buy. And it's not a CME-accredited program. I
am a consultant speaker for VYNE and receiving compensation for today's event. I do it get compensated accordingly for lectures that I do with
VYNE. And all the clinical pictures that I use today are patients that are in my practice. They have been consented for use by these patients. And
it's important to note that individual results may vary.

Next slide, please. So Dr. Lain covered this very thoroughly. The historical treatment paradigm, typically and this is a very sort of abbreviated view.
For the mild patient, typically will use topicals and those topicals can be prescription or over the counter. When we move into that moderate
patient, the oral medication, certainly will be an option via antibiotics or spironolactone and some orals as well as prescription topicals. Now when
we move to severe, certainly, we're going to use oral medications as well as prescription topicals as well as potentially oral isotretinoin. Next slide,
please. So relative to the epidemiology of acne in the United States, roughly 50 million people suffer with acne vulgaris. And It can affect roughly
85% of teenagers that can occur at most ages and even persistent to adulthood. It's associated with a significant amount of physical as well as
psychological morbidity, including permanent scarring of the skin as well as poor self image and self esteem issues as well as depression and
anxiety. And we'll talk a little about that as I they have 1 patient who exhibited some of these effects, we'll show that later on. And then relative to
its direct impact relative to cost and indirect cost, totals roughly $3 billion. So folks, we have a captive audience. And to have AMZEEQ this novel
minocycline foam formulation in our therapeutic armamentarium is most certainly beneficial.

Next slide, please. Okay. So Dr. Lain again covered this very thoroughly. Relative to efficacy, our Phase III clinical trials showed fantastic results and
relative to systemic exposure. Kudos to VYNE for a very good study looking at maximum use where they essentially compared oral minocycline at
1 mg per kilogram versus topical minocycline at 4 grams topically daily for 21 days, which is actually 8x the dose that we use AMZEEQ, so much
more powerful for their maximum use study. And they assessed the serum concentrations comparatively between the oral administration and the
topical, and there was a 750 fold decrease in the topical versus oral. So taking it orally, certainly the systemic absorption is much more and that
sort of plays well into its safety profile. So it's a minimal adverse event profile. And essentially, what we looked at, as Dr. Lain tried to was was the
redness to irritation, skin peeling, burning, hyperpigmentation, which are all I'll tell you a teetering in the acne space.

So 95% of the skin reactions were considered none or mild in the Phase III clinical trials relative to their patient experience, which is so important
because often you're dealing with teenagers or even young adults, the cosmetic elegance of the formulary. It bodes in place so well into whether
they're going to use it or not. Compliance is a big issue. And if it doesn't feel good going on, it's irritating. If the patients are just not satisfied with
the way it feels going on, they're not going to use it. So patient experience was very positive. Our relative results, again, the Phase III clinical trials
showed a significant reduction in inflammatory lesions and the relative low accessibility. So eligible patients will pay as low as $35 for the medication.

Next slide, please. So AMZEEQ, this topical novel foam formulation indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe acne in patients 9 years or
older. Okay. Next slide, please. Excellent. So I like -- the clinical images really, I think, tell a story, and let's start with his first patient. So this first
patient was a very sweet and spirited young ladies. She represents a very interesting subset of patients in my practice that I think Dr. Lain and Dr.
Stein Gold can sort of relate to. She presents to my office. And she is the kind of patient that says, okay, Dr. Moore, I have acne, and I need it to be
gone tomorrow. And this particular patient actually was the made of honor at her sister's wedding. She had a series of events that was coming up
in the week in terms of bridal shower and the wedding was in 4 weeks. So she comes into my office and says, Dr. Moore, I need to be clear a week
and I need to stay clear. So I think we can all relate to these patients who want to be cleared yesterday. And what was interesting about this 1 lady
was that he tried over-the-counter medications, actually tried to prescription clindamycin with no improvement. And she also clearly stated to me
that Dr. Moore, retinoids make my skin worse. I can't afford to use that right now because I have pictures to take in a week. So is very adamant
about getting clear and no irritation. So I think that, again, my colleagues can relate to this patient wants to be cleared yesterday, can't tolerate
anything. So if you look at her baseline presentation, you can see on that right sheet, she had significant redness or what we call erythema. You
can see that those inflammatory papules were pretty evident and relatively extensive regarding the right cheek. So we -- and that was on both
cheeks in the face as well. So we started here at AMZEEQ and monotherapy, and you can see and I'll tell you something. So the little caveats, the
story is that we were able to get a relatively clear for that bridal shower and wedding. She sent me some beautiful pictures of the wedding and
how well she did. And she was really singing the praises of AMZEEQ. So you can see this continued out to week 12. If you look at that digital image

                                                                                                                                                                             
 there at week 12, you can see a significant reduction in inflammatory lesions, there was less dryness and she achieved and maintained clinical
clearance. So these are the success stories that I'd like to sort of highlight. And one point I want to make here with this patient number one is that
we were able to achieve clearance with on label use of AMZEEQ monotherapy with this moderately involved patient and the therapeutic efficacy
was clear cut, and it was sustainable with excellent tolerability to not complain of any irritation, not in peeling she was able to be that beautiful
made of honor and take great wedding pictures of which she sent to me. So we as clinicians love these success stories. And I'll tell you for me as a
dermatologist, it never gets sold. In fact, I always tell -- I train residents and I always tell they never be pedestrian or less than enthusiastic about
the acne patient. And I know my colleagues can relate when you're on that 50 or 60th patient of a day and you had already 25 acne patients,
sometimes it gets a little easy to be less than enthusiastic and to be a pedestrian in your approach. But I always encourage young residents, get
excited about that acne patient because the dividends that you send to yield in terms of self esteem with that patient, getting that patient clear,
getting that patient in that wedding, taking great pictures.

Now I'm going to show you a patient in 2, who also to really -- it just -- you start to make some great strides and the acne patient really provides
that. Let's go slide -- patient #2, please. So again, the agitation, wonderful opportunity to do some very unique things in these patients' lives, not
only in terms of clearing them, but also personally, I'm going to lift that up with this patient #2. So patient #2 was a 21-year African-American and
African-Caribbean her parents were Jamaican descent. And she presented with a moderate acne for 3 years. She had tried over-the-counter
medications. She was on clindamycin. And this patient, I consulted actually in my Memorial Hospital West, which is actually -- it's in a hospital
setting, it's a private practice within the hospital setting. So the lions share of our patients in this practice are physicians and nurses and health care
providers, and we see the children of these employees as well.

So her mother and nurse and when she presented to me, the mom was adamant about no antibiotics and the patient was a super, super intelligent
young lady. She had a little bit of background. She had been duly enrolled to high school. She's finished with 2 years of college already under her
belt. She majored in biochemistry at the University of Florida. Graduated with honors 1 of TA in biochemistry, and she applying the medical school.
So when she presented to me, the first statement she said was Dr. Moore, I would love to be just like you, but how am I going to get the medical
school with all of this acne on my face. And you could see, and it really resonated with me that her confidence was down, herself esteem was down.
And she -- this was down on her luck. So again -- and this is where I always tell the resins, here is a wonderful, wonderful and unique opportunity
to do something amazing and set patients' lives. So with the copy out in mind that mom did not want antibiotics. We prescribed AMZEEQ in the
morning and we also incorporated a retinoid Benzyl peroxide at nighttime. And you can see as early as week 6, reduction in inflammatory lesions,
reduction in the inflammatory -- and in the hyperpigmentation. You can even see some minimalization in the apparent scaring that was going on
before. And again, sustainable results right into week 12, which was fantastic. So she did very, very well. And as an update or caveat to this story,
again, why says wonderful, unique opportunities, never get old for me. She is accepted now to Dartmouth medical school, she is in her first year.
Her skin looks amazingly beautiful. How mom says she's doing amazing. She texts me every now and again, just to send me pictures now. And
again, just a wonderful success story on AMZEEQ.

So next slide, please. Okay.

(technical difficulty)

To shape the hyperpigmentation. So this is a patient. If you look at her baseline photos, you can see that she had significant hyperpigmentation.
You can see that there was significant dryness as well as significant inflammatory papules. Now one thing I want to clue everyone into, if you look
at her continents -- so look at her at baseline, and then you look at her at week 6, and then let's go out to week 12. Let's look at how that sort of --
I won't call it anger stare but she was not happy at baseline. At week 6, you can see somewhat of a half smile, and then look at the fantastic smile
by week 12. So you can see by week 6, we had a reduction in those inflammatory lesions. You can also see that the hyperpigmentation seem to be
remitting as we had stopped doxycycline orally completely. And you can see by week 12, again, just tremendous results that were sustainable,
reduction in those inflammatory lesions, improvement in the overall complexion, less dryness. So this patient did very, very well.

Let's do the next slide, please. Okay. So patient 4 was an Indian patient -- Indian-American patients who had presented to me -- who had been
using retinoids consistently on and off for about a year, and she said that when she would use a retinoid, she found some satisfaction in terms of
improvement, but she would relay that when using something in the morning, it would always seem to burn and that sort of would dissuade her
from using her retinoid consistently. So I like this patient presentation because it sort of illustrates how AMZEEQ sort of plays well with some of the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 other topical agents that we use to treat our patients. We incorporated AMZEEQ into her morning dosing, and then she continued to use her
retinoid at night. And you can see by week 12, significant reduction in inflammatory papules, you can see an overall improvement in the
hyperpigmentation. And she was doing very well, and this was also, again, very much sustainable. So I like this case because it illustrates, again,
how this emollient in the vehicle helps to assist that patient using a nighttime regimen, which can sometimes be a little bit irritating, can cause
some feeling and dryness. But -- and when you couple it with a morning sort of moisturizing agent that also is anti acne in the form of the AMZEEQ
foam, they just work very, very well together. So this patient was able to continue her treatment combination of AMZEEQ of the day and the retinoid
with the benzoyl peroxid at night and continue to do quite well.

Okay. Let's go to the next slide, please. So this next patient, patient #5, I believe Dr. Lain had a very similar patient was on minocycline for several
months. And what she had relayed to me was that the minocycline seemed to help with her breakouts, but she was, again, noticing this sort of
grayish or darkest queue or hyperpigmentation that was occurring sort of around her cheeks and a little bit of her jawline. And she said that if she
would stop it, she would get a significant flare in her breakout, primarily on the cheeks and the jawline and even on the forehead as well. So -- and
a lot -- I know that my fellow clinicians on the line can relate to the patient who is on an oral and when they (inaudible) stop or just stop it immediately,
they get this rebound flare. So this is that patient that we see quite commonly in clinical practice. So when she presented to me, you can see at
those baseline pictures for left and right face, you can see significant involvement of that mandibular line. You can see that there is still some
remnant of this hyperpigmentation. She had showed me pictures where it was far worse, but again, she had stopped the minocycline and then
she was experiencing this rebound flare. So we clearly kept minocycline orally on hold. I started her on AMZEEQ in the morning, and we also
introduced some spironolactone daily. And I'd like you to take a look at the week 12 picture. Because while you can't directly see those cheeks, I
have to tell you, the inflammatory lesions cleared very, very nicely. And you can also see reduction in that hyperpigmentation that was pretty
significant, while she was on the oral minocycline. So again, the use care of minocycline and being able to avoid have a topical foam, being able
to avoid using the oral was very, very pointing here because we were able to to gain and achieve clearance that was lasting on our past week 12
with minimalization of inflammatory lesions. And you can see from a pigment standpoint, she was doing quite well. Excellent. And then next slide.
And then, okay, the next slide. This is the final slide, the ISI, which my colleague Ted Lain went over very thoroughly.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Well, thanks, Dr. Moore. And at this time, I'll turn it back to Sarah. It will bring the rest of the panel and then we can take some questions from the
audience before we start our conversation around the rosacea marketplace and ZILXI. So we can -- let's bring in Dr. Lain, Dr. Moore and Dr. Stein
Gold as well as the rest of the team. So Sarah, do you want to get things going on in the question-and-answer process?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
So we're now opening up the webinar for questions. (Operator Instructions) We ask that you keep your questions, the topic of AMZEEQ for now.
You'll have the opportunity to ask questions regarding ZILXI later during the Q&A. (Operator Instructions)

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And our first question comes from Louise Chen at Cantor.

Nothing from Louise. Maybe we'll go back to Louise later in the queue.

Patrick Dolezal are you there? Sorry, we have Louise.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Louise Alesandra Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst & MD
So a couple of questions for the doctors here. First, on AMZEEQ, the insurance coverage. How has it been for patients? Have there been any barriers
to uptake? And then for adolescents, are they treating their acne despite the pandemic? How has that changed the treatment paradigm? And then
last question here is in practice, how quickly does AMZEEQ work? How are the results relative to what the clinical study showed? I know you talked
about it a bit anyhow in the presentation but just curious to ask you directly.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Louise. So why don't we just (inaudible) work around the horn, as they say. So we'll take the first question, just on access and insurance,
what's been your experience. So I'll start with Dr. Lain.

Ted Lain
Yes. As was mentioned by Matt, there is a PBM that just -- we don't have great coverage without PBM. So there are certainly a subset of patients
that are benefiting from the samples that we've been given as we await full coverage of AMZEEQ. But in my area, the vast majority of patients that
have prescribed have been able to get it at a very reasonable cost. It hasn't -- access hasn't been an issue. I think that, that has been a surprising --
that's been very surprising for me as VYNE has kind of commercialized this product as a small company. They figured out the access part very
quickly. So I have to tell you that was surprising and a good surprise. There were multiple questions there. They -- Onset of efficacy is -- and I think
Dr. Moore touched on this, I think it's quick. And so what we saw in the trials has been replicated in what we see in clinical practice. In terms of our
patients coming in for their appointments, I can tell you, look, we've got 15 practices in our portfolio of practices here. We've got -- we're at about
95% of where we were pre-COVID in terms of number of appointments. We're in Texas and Louisiana, so I can only speak for those 2 states. But
certainly growing from month-to-month. And so we are absolutely getting close to 100% of where we were pre-COVID. So hopefully, that answers
your question.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Great. Thanks, Dr. Lain. Dr. Moore, how about your experience? You want to go through each of the questions?

Julian Moore
Sure. So relative to access, we've had very, very good coverage and access. The lion share of my patients do get the medication as prescribed them.
Some of them who -- the insurance may not cover it. We do get very good coverage with the reps out in our territory. So we do sample it from time
to time. And I'm sure, Dr. Lain, probably in your area -- I'm not sure in Florida, it's been a big phenomenon in the specialty pharmacy, which has
somewhat been a go between the patient and the prescription and the insurance. So they have been able to offset things quite nicely. So I'll tell
you, we really -- with those 3 avenues, either directly to insurance or specialty pharmacy samples, we're getting patients medication. So access
really has not been a very big issue at all. It's been quite good.

And the next question was relative to onset. So I'll tell you my clinical practice. Clinically, my patients mirror those Phase III clinical trials quite nicely
in that you'll see quite rapid response. If I can take you back to my patient #1, who I had to declare yesterday, I'll tell you by week 2 or 3, and I'm
pretty close with following up with my patients, even if it's by text or e-mail to see how they're doing, especially when a big event is coming up.
And she is one of the very classic and scenarios of its rapid onset and efficacy that is able to be sustainable throughout time. And then relative to
COVID. I'll tell you very interesting, I was humbled that throughout the entire COVID sort of calamity, we were sort of beneficial. And like you, Dr.
Lain, we have about 25 offices. And were able to sort of benefit from watching what started as a real collapse in New York. And we really jumped
on top of PPE and making sure we were sanitizing, following CDC guidelines. And we worked through entire COVID, it certainly was a bit of a
drop-off around April, March. But at this juncture, we are back to pre-COVID, I'd say about 96%, 97% relative to the general derm patient so -- and
acting for that matter. I hope that answers your question.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Moore. And let's bring in Dr. Stein Gold, and we'll hear from you on ZILXI, but let's get your thoughts and perspective on those questions
around access and patients coming in through COVID as well as what's been your experience and how quickly AMZEEQ works? So what are your
thoughts?

Linda Stein Gold
Okay. Well, thank you, and hello to everybody. So I have a very similar experience. I would say the majority of my patients are able to get it. And I
do think that sometimes providing a sample upfront when I'm going to write a branded product, helps the patient to understand why I'm prescribing
this particular product and not a generic. So I think that definitely helps, sometimes while they're waiting for their prescription. In terms of time to
onset, like the others, I'm fortunate in that I am an investigator, but I'm also a medical dermatologist. So I get to see how does it act in the clinical
trials. And then I hope it mirrors what I see in the clinic, and that is what I found so far. So I think the results are very similar to what we saw in the
trials. And then finally, in terms of COVID, we are back to 100%. So my schedule is exactly as it was pre-COVID. But what's important to know is that
a lot of doctors are practicing telemedicine as we were. And acne is one of those diagnoses that is perfect for telemedicine. We can't do full skin
exams. It's very difficult to do mole checks, but we sure can treat acne by telemedicine. So I think that that's been a definite advantage for us.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great, great. Thanks, Dr. Stein Gold. Okay, Michael, Sarah, I think we have other questions.

Operator
Yes. Our next question, David, is from David Amsellem at Piper.

David A. Amsellem - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So just a couple. I know you alluded to this earlier, but I want to get a sense from you, Dr. Stein Gold and Dr. Lain, how you're thinking about where
you slot in systemic tetracyclines versus AMZEEQ? Systemic tetracyclines have been available for quite some time. You talked about their limitations.
So give us -- now that you have a topical tetracycline, give us your view of what kind of patient gets a systemic and what kind of patient gets the
topical?

Ted Lain
(inaudible) say if I go first?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes, yes. No, go ahead, Dr. Lain, by all means.

Ted Lain
So even this is a really good question. And I find myself changing my habits. If you look at the data in regards to lesion count reduction and IGA
success for some of the more recent tetracycline classes, again, we see data that the numbers of IGA success are not much different than some of
the topicals that we use. And so when you look at it as a data-driven decision, topicals can do just as much as the systemics based on the primary

                                                                                                                                                                             
 efficacy endpoints of the trials. So then, again, it's difficult to change provider practices and habits, and I found that even for myself. I know the
data and yet, I still have been prescribing more antibiotics, and I think I should be. And so I find myself kind of really working on switching over to
the topical -- to AMZEEQ. I mean this is the only topical tetracycline that we have. And so it's really changing my practice because I'm using much
more of it. So I think how do I slot it? I think it slots in just like an oral antibiotic, and I'm changing towards that because we just don't need the oral
antibiotics for the vast majority of patients. Certainly, there are some who will benefit from the systemic anti-inflammatory effect that you get with
the oral tetracycline. But there is a vast majority who will do just fine with the topical in my view.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Moore, you want to offer your thoughts?

Julian Moore
Surely. So I agree with Dr. Lain in that conventionally, a patient presents and we will -- you look at the degree of involvement, and it sort of will
trigger a certain reaction. But with the advent of this novel formulary, it really calls us and allows us to be able to sort of look a little bit more closely
at antibiotics stewardship from its oral administration versus topically and the upside. And like Dr. Lain, I have used a lot more topicals and have
been slow on the trigger when it comes to the oral and AMZEEQ has done that for me. So again, certainly, there are going to be patients that are
involved and they are going to need an oral. But I have certainly used AMZEEQ a lot more in lieu of the oral administration.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. And Dr. Stein Gold, your thoughts.

Linda Stein Gold
Yes. So what's interesting is when we think about the role of the oral antibiotic, they're not necessarily the magic that we give them. For instance,
when you take a pill by mouth and you look at the amount of drug that actually gets to the skin, it's very, very, very [low]. You look at the amount
that's in the circulation, it's very high. We want to treat the skin. In contrast, when you take minocycline in the foam formulation and you put it
directly on the skin, we have magnitudes of more cycling direct. So I think that we have to take a step back and say, what are we trying to accomplish?
We want the drug to be at the site of action, and that's what we're doing with the topical drug. So I think it makes sense. Often people think about
an oral agent when they have a large body surface area, and it's difficult to reach all those places, but the foam formulation actually provides a
vehicle that spreads very, very nicely. And we don't worry about treating the trunk in terms of bleaching the clothing like we would with benzoyl
peroxide. So I think this really causes people to take a step back and try to figure out what are we trying to accomplish.

David A. Amsellem - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
If I may say again, just the second question, just looking further down the line, topical combination products are pretty common in the treatment
of acne, as you know. So what I'm asking here is how big of a deal would it be to have a topical combination of AMZEEQ with, say, a retinoid? And
does that does that sort of change how you're thinking of usage and frequency of usage? Help me understand your thought process there?

Linda Stein Gold
Dave, why don't you -- you want to address?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Myself?

Linda Stein Gold
Yes. Because I mean...

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes, sure. I mean, it's -- we're actually looking to address that, and that's with our combination product, FCD105, which is the 3% dose of minocycline
in our foam [chaise], combined with 0.3% dose of adapalene. We had very good, very positive Phase II results that we announced early in the spring.
We believe that we've got an excellent product with AMZEEQ, which we've talked about so far this afternoon. And Dr. Moore and Dr. Lain and Dr.
Stein Gold have talked about their experience, which obviously seems to be quite positive. And so we're very excited about the prospects for
AMZEEQ. And then our mission as a company is to constantly look to develop new and innovative therapies. And if we're successful in bringing a
product such as FCD105 through the process and ultimately to market, that would be the first combination of doxycycline with the retinoid. And
yes, the data was quite compelling. Our view was that it's potentially best-in-class. And I think each of the panel members have talked through
from their own experience where an antibiotic topically with a retinoid and some combination can help out with some of their patients. So perhaps
I'll just turn it back over to the panel for their thoughts on and combination products such as FCD105, and what that could potentially offer. So
Linda, why don't I start back with you, and we'll work then through Dr. Moore and Dr. Lain.

Linda Stein Gold
I think it makes sense. I mean, we've already talked about the fact that many of us use this as 2 separate times a day. Anytime you can simplify a
regimen for a patient and give them 1 thing to do, and you put the control in the hands of the physician because you know every time they apply
their medication, they're getting combination therapy. If you simplify and take -- you give the patient too many things to do, they end up doing
nothing because it just is too overwhelming. Simplify it down, give them something that they can do, especially one thing once-a-day is always
going to be a win.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great, thanks. Dr. Moore?

Julian Moore
Yes, exactly right. The biggest sort of wall we as clinicians face with our patients is compliance, okay? So if you can simplify the steps, compliance
goes way up. So without a question, I'm happy to hear, Dave, that this is already in the pipeline because we know combination products work. And
they help the patient to to have less steps as efficacy goes up, I mean, as compliance goes up, so does efficacy. So I agree.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain?

Ted Lain
Look, the worst that Dave did was give me a cell phone number because now I can call him directly and ask him when we're going to start these
Phase III trials for the combination product. We were involved with the Phase II and the efficacy, as shown in the Phase II results that have been

                                                                                                                                                                             
 announced where we're seeing in my practice, of course, we were blinded but there were certainly patients who just did very well. And so I'm very
excited about the potential for this combination product. Just to add on to what my colleagues have said, I think adapalene makes a ton of sense
because of its work on the comedonal, excuse me, the black and white head type of acne as well as we know from some literature that's available
regarding the effect of macular acne scarring. So I think that it's incumbent upon dermatologists to provide our patients with the best topical that
we can give them. And so something that helps with both the inflammatory and the noninflammatory as well as the scarring and the overall texture
and tone of the face, we'll do very well. It's just going to do very well.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great, thanks. Michael, do we have any more calls coming in? I know we have several questions that have been written in. And -- but perhaps, we
could see if there's any more live calls and, and we'll see if there's an overlap in what we're getting in writing stuff.

Operator
Yes, couple more live, Dave. Next one is from Patrick Dolezal at LifeSci Capital.

Patrick Edward Dolezal - LifeSci Capital, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So for our KOLs, I'm just kind of curious out of all the prescriptions that you're presently writing for acne. Roughly, if you could ballpark what
proportion are for AMZEEQ presently? And then kind of as we think about the broader launch dynamics, I mean, obviously, you guys are thought
leaders in your space and very familiar with AMZEEQ. But how long does it take for physicians to generally get comfortable with new products?
And how does that proportion of patients that they're prescribing to you change over time?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Right. Dr. Moore, you want to start?

Julian Moore
Can you -- sorry, my internet going in and out, I didn't hear that question. Can you repeat that for me? Dave, can you hear me?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. No, I can. So the question was about what percentage in looking at since AMZEEQ has been out in the market, what percentage actually would
you sense is AMZEEQ? And then how you actually envision that to be changing over the course of the time?

Julian Moore
You mean percentage -- what percentage of the sort of therapeutic regimen that I'm prescribing? What percentage of it is the efficacy of AMZEEQ
versus something else. Is the question?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
No, no. It's our product that actually you're using. So it's...
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Julian Moore
I see. Sure, surely. So in terms of my acne patients, I'll tell you, I would say, I'm roughly at about 75% of my patients that come in with moderate to
severe, maybe in upwards of 80% are getting AMZEEQ.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain?

Ted Lain
I don't know that I hit 70% or 80% of my patients for AMZEEQ. But certainly, it's increasing in terms of the number of patients I'm prescribing it to
each month. I really -- guys, I'm sorry, it would be difficult for me to give a percentage, but it's growing, I can tell you that. And then there was a --
what was the second question? I'm sorry.

There was a percentage of patients, oh, the uptake of new -- yes, it was -- I think it was the uptake of new prescriptions by community derm.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes.

Ted Lain
Linda, I'd love to hear your view on this because I find this difficult to answer. I -- those of us who do research tend to be early adopters because
we're so -- we have experience with the product. But I would say because this is so novel, and again, because of clindamycin resistance that's so
well-known in the community, I would see this as being easily early adopted versus some of its contemporary peers.

Linda Stein Gold
Ted, I agree with you. First of all, I don't know my percentages either. We see a lot of acne patients. And so I would just be guessing. But what used
to be Foamix now buying -- what they did was actually really interesting because we started the buzz and we started the conversation well before
the drug was FDA approved. And there were some science here that actually caused us -- it was a huge just like slap in the face saying, alot of the
things that we've been telling you aren't necessarily true anymore. And part of that comes with bacterial resistance. And I think, Ted, you touched
on this during your talk, but we have levels that are so high with this drug that the risk of developing bacterial resistance is significantly less than
what we've seen with other agents in the past. So that is fascinating to (inaudible). We're just -- it's amazing. And so people are thirsty for this kind
of knowledge. And they've had great scientists who have really gotten out, gotten this data on the podium. You can't go to a scientific dermatologic
meeting without hearing about what we're now starting to understand with topical minocycline. So I think that there's a great buzz about it. I think
people are excited about it, and that's always great for new product.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks. Mike, any other live questions?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Operator
Yes. One more live question, Dave. That's from Oren Livnat at H.C. Wainright.

Oren Gabriel Livnat - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst
Can you hear me?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. We got you on.

Oren Gabriel Livnat - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst
So you just mentioned the buzz on the clinician end. I'm curious about what you're hearing from your patients. Obviously, VYNE is just now starting
the DTC side of the equation. But given that you've had such early success with your own patients, are you getting people coming in asking about
this product just by word-of-mouth already?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain, you want to take -- start first?

Ted Lain
That's a really good question. It's very timely. I have not had any patient come to me asking for AMZEEQ. But I've got a senior in high school. My
daughter is a senior in high school, and she obviously is very active on Instagram. And she has shown me ads on Instagram or mentions on Instagram
for AMZEEQ. She works here in the office with me part time. So she knows what goes on. And so she has shown me. So definitely, there's some
uptake, and we see some increased awareness in that population.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Moore.

Julian Moore
Excellent. Can you hear me?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes.

Julian Moore
Excellent. So I got to tell you that while I haven't seen patients who just de novo come in asking for AMZEEQ, what I have have seen a huge uptick
is, for example, you'll treat a patient for acne, and then they'll send you their sister, their cousin. And in that sense, I am seeing patients come back
and say, I want you to give me what you gave my sister. I want you to give me what you gave my mom. So from that sense, I will tell you, yes, but

                                                                                                                                                                             
 to say that they're coming in just because they saw a commercial or they want to know about AMZEEQ, no. But intrinsically, patients who have
seen, who tell other family members, they are coming back and asking for it, like I want what my cousin had kind of thing.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Stein Gold, your thoughts.

Linda Stein Gold
So to be honest, I don't really care when my patients come in and ask for something and say me, I'm different front from -- I don't care. You can ask
for whatever you want, and you're going to get what I want you to have. So I'll listen and I certainly take into consideration their fears and their
desires and things like that. But I have -- I look at them and I develop a plan, and they can ask for coconut oil and they can ask for all kinds of stuff
from Costco that they've been using. But so I don't know that, that matters that much. And I don't know how many physicians are truly swayed
when somebody comes in and holding people magazine article or something. We're happy to talk about it. But generally, you're going to get what
I think you will -- work best to do.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Michael, any other live questions.

Operator
No more live, Dave, but a couple of questions have been sent in on the the Zoom platform. First of these is, since AMZEEQ has become available,
what products do you think that it has replaced most often?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. Well, start with Dr. Moore.

Julian Moore
Surely. So I will say that ACZONE would probably be my #1 in terms of replacement. Secondarily, we're going to look at the oral administration of
antibiotics, which certainly, I have had a downturn in relative to use of AMZEEQ. I think those would be my top 2, ACZONE #1 and also to, let's
include in that clindamycin. An those would be my top 3, ACZONE, clinda and then perhaps the orals.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. Dr. Stein Gold?

Linda Stein Gold
I just want to make one comment here. So AMZEEQ was really comparing itself to oral minocycline. But we have to make reference to the fact that
when we looked and evaluated patients who are in the clinical trials, they had both superficial inflammatory as well as comedonal acne. And when
we look at the data, we see that it actually worked and was statistically superior in both of those. So it does work for all different types of acne. I
                                                                                                                                                                             
 certainly think that this would be an immediate substitution if you're looking to substitute an oral antibiotic, but it's also appropriate for potentially
any acne patient who has potentially comedonal acne, Papus postural. So it's something that people would think of top of mind.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And Dr. Lain?

Ted Lain
Hello.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. It's good. Michael, what else we got. How about take 2 more questions. And then we'll turn it over to talk about ZILXI, and then we can pick
up any additional questions at the end. So got two more, Michael?

Operator
Yes, Dave. We have a question that just came in from Balaji Barclays. He'd like to know, are there any clinical settings where the doctors have not
seen adequate responses to AMZEEQ?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain, why don't we will start with you.

Ted Lain
That's why I included in my slide deck, the -- kind of what's the driver for the acne as you think about it. And if there is someone with a strong
hormonal driver of their acne, if it's an adult female that flares around her cycle, for example, a topical -- any topical, I'm not just referring to AMZEEQ,
really, this is any topical. I just don't think will give you the kind of results that you need unless you focus on the underlying issues. So I wouldn't --
again, it's based on patient selection. I would say where you see a failure of ""AMZEEQ as monotherapy "" versus the product itself.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Dr. Moore?

Julian Moore
Yes. Certainly, so the ideology of acne sometimes can be multifactorial, and there are scenarios where like Dr. Lain said, where there's more of a
hormonal component where it might not be as effective. And also, too, what I find myself ciphering through a lot of times is the level of compliance
because I had -- I will tell you, I have had patients who've come back and just said it's not working for whatever reason, and you worry how much
you wonder, how much of it is a compliance or actually just not efficacious. And I think Dr. Lain and Dr. Gold, we all have those patients where you'll
talk to the teenager then the mom is standing behind them shaking their head telling that they're not using it. So compliance certainly will be a
factor that will play a role. And certainly, the physiology or etiology of the acne in said patient is important to take into consideration when you're
looking at whether the AMZEEQ works or not.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. And then finally, Dr. Stein Gold.

Julian Moore
So what's important is -- and we learned this from clinical trials, no one drug works in every single acne patient. But when we look at the bar that
we use in the trials, it was clear, almost clear. So there's a lot of patients that get a little bit better, but not completely better. And in real life, we mix
and match medicines to try to get them to that completely clear state. So there will definitely be people who don't get to clear -- completely clear
with monotherapy. There might be some patients who just don't get anything with it, but I think the vast majority, at least the improvement and
there are many that benefit from having it used with other medications.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And Michael, why don't we take one more question then.

Operator
Just one more here. And this investor would like to know what do you think the long-term potential for AMZEEQ is? And if you were to look at, let's
say, 3 or 4 years, how do you see it fitting into the treatment paradigm for acne?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. Dr. Lain, why don't we start with you?

Ted Lain
I think its uptake will continue to increase. I think -- as I think about the pipeline of acne products that we have in clinical trials right now in Phase
II and Phase III, certainly, I don't have all of them at my site, but we've done quite a few. I really don't see anything else overtaking it in terms of the
topical monotherapy or combination antibiotic products. There's products that are coming through that there's an anti CBM inhibitor, for example,
that works in a completely different way. That's a new mechanism of action. There's some combination products coming through, but nothing
that would replace or compete with the way that Foamix -- excuse me, that AMZEEQ works. So I just see it continuing to improve in terms of its
market share without a competitor coming that would try and steal from it.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks. Dr. Moore.

Julian Moore
Yes. So there is a reason why I think minocycline was a tried and true (inaudible) relative to the treatment of acne. So I agree with Dr. Lain that I
think it's here to stay. And again, it fits in very well. We look at the art of treating our patients. We're in various cases, we will use multiple other
medications, and it plays nicely. So I do foresee that this will be around for a very long time.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. And last but not least, Dr. Stein Gold, what your thoughts?

Linda Stein Gold
Yes, I agree. And Ted really summed it up. When we look at what's coming and what we have right now, I don't see anything that directly competes
with it.
PRESENTATION
David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Right. Great. Well, I want to thank the panel again. These were great questions, fantastic dialogue, excellent exchanges. So why don't we now shift?
As I announced in the opening -- in my opening comments, it's an exciting day for us here at VYNE. We officially are launching ZILXI or 1.5% topical
minocycline foam product for the treatment of rosacea. It is now available for pharmacies effective today, so they can order and bring it in. We
actually have our sales force that's in training as we speak. So why don't I turn over to Matt Wiley, again, our Chief Commercial Officer, that can take
you through how we view the opportunity for rosacea with ZILXI and some of our plans. So Matt, take it away.

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Thanks, Dave. So we'll start on the next slide, and I'll talk about the market size opportunities. So there are 4.4 million prescriptions written for
ization in 2019 that is over $1 billion in revenue in the same year. So this is a large market. And I've heard previously that the market is not as big
as the acne market, but the thing to keep in mind, and hopefully, you get this over the course of the presentation, is while this market is not as big,
I believe that you'll see that it is underserved and there's a significant unmet need in the market as we go to the next slide.

First of all, we look at health care practitioner perceptions as it relates to different disease states. And so these were live interviews with physicians.
And what we tried to assess here is on the X&Y axis, how much time and effort, different conditions take-up in your practice? And then what level
of skill is needed for those different conditions? And then the context or the perception of just how many tools you have at your disposal to treat
those conditions? And so if you look at acne, for instance, less time and effort is necessary for those patients, perhaps a little bit less skill, a lot of
different tools. Conditions like psoriasis, a high level of skill, a lot of time and effort goes into it. A decent set of tools. And in rosacea, it's still in that
upper right hand quadrant where it requires a high level of skill, a lot of time and effort and the number of tools that they have to treat the condition
are relatively small. So the rosacea patients are more akin to a wedding ring with practice is the analogy I'll use perhaps than acne is and does
demand more time from physicians and more attention.

Next slide. So let's talk about the patient satisfaction. When asked, and this is a study that was done back in 2019 early on. This is our demand study.
We ask consumers what their likelihood would be to seek a better solution? What we found is over 70% of the patients indicated that they were
at least somewhat likely to seek a better solution for the rosacea. And then in another study that was done recently, the Awareness, Trial and Usage
study, this was just delivered to us in mid-September. We found that if a physician were asked for either a switch in therapy or a specific therapy,
we found that almost 90% would grant that. Now Dr. Stein Gold may be in that 12% quadrant up there, but what we heard is for this condition,
they would be amenable to helping the patient should they ask for a specific medication or to be switched from what they're currently on?

Next slide. So these quotes are from a article that was -- it's a -- I'm looking for self magazine back in May of 2018, and this is just perspectives of
patients about how they feel rosacea is having an impact on their lives, and you can read these. ""The hardest part is never knowing what my face
is going to look like when I wake up"". ""I was hoping that the medications would work, but they don't"". ""It feels like a permanent sunburn and affects
every aspect of my life"". So this is a very real condition. These patients are anxious about the rosacea, anxious about their appearance. And they're
not necessarily getting what they need from the medications that they've had to date.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next slide. As we think about the opportunity from a launch surrogate perspective, we note that, yes, Oracea was launched back in 2006 and has
the steepest uptake curve here. But if you look at year 1, roughly 0.25 million prescriptions not dissimilar when Soolantra launched back in 2015.
And the peak year of these surrogates is anywhere between 500,000 to 750-or-so thousand prescriptions at peak. Now the thing I'll note here is
that nothing has been done from a market development perspective to actually grow the market. So these drugs have enjoyed these market shares
and this growth within a market that is relatively static. And the question that we ask ourselves commercially is, can something be done also down
the line to move diagnosis and treatment for patients who may not be under the care of a physician today.

Next slide. One of the big opportunities as we think about active competition that's come to market in the last 14 years is that there hasn't been a
lot. As mentioned, Oracea launched back in 2006, basically, there was no additional direct type 2 rosacea product launched in between Oracea
and Soolantra. But ZILXI is launching at a time when nothing new has been introduced for these type 2 patients in greater than 5 years. So it's a
great opportunity for us to really own the discourse in our physician offices and really introduce something with a lot of resonance given the unmet
need that we're seeing in the market.

Next slide. As it relates to COVID impact, you might think that similar to acne that rosacea would also be climbing back. This market is based on
this data anyway. These are NRxs-branded market. And you see that the market is completely healed. The most recent data point is over 10,000
prescriptions in a week. That's similar to what we see back in January, February, so this is certainly a dynamic that gives us confidence that we're
launching into a market that is completely back to ""normal"".

Next slide. Some of the triggers for rosacea, as I'm sure you're aware, it's the changes in season when patients are overheated or it's very hot outside
and when they're stressed. And so one of the things that we've noted as of late, is that due to COVID-19 there is an increase in anxiety and increase
in stress levels. There's also irritation from masks that need to be worn. And so this has been perhaps a contributor to the healing of the market
that I showed in the previous slide.

Next slide. This is an interesting slide. It's an interesting market insight that we uncovered early last year that we think is is an opportunity for us,
especially when we think about our consumer efforts and consumer mobilization. So as you can see in the left side graph. This is rosacea search
volume over time, over a 4-year period and -- a 4.5-year period. You can see that searches for rosacea related -- searches for rosacea seem to peak
in March, April, May of each year. And that's an important finding. So we went back and we looked at diagnosed patients, patients were diagnosed
for the first time between 2015 and 2018 in our data set. And what we found is that the gating of diagnosis does actually correlate to this finding
that we see in seasonality. So why does this happen? Well, obviously, the change from winter to spring, especially in the southern states where the
heat is exacerbating the symptoms may be driving this behavior. So this is good information for us to have as we think about our digital efforts,
how we buy keywords, when we buy keywords and what may be driving the behavior to get them to a clinician and with that, we can get them
the right information. So as that was asked in the last segment, perhaps we can have them ask for ZILXI by name.

So next slide. So our strategy for ZILXI is similar to that of AMZEEQ. We do want to focus on our positioning and our story, which I'm very excited
about for this product. Consumer mobilization is a bit different because we're talking about millennials and Gen X as opposed to Gen Z. So how
consumers get information on drugs is a little bit different, and we're going to explore many of those as we get into market during the right time
frame, of course. Efficient deployment, I will walk you through how we're overlaying the target prescribers on top of our current footprint and that
access is, of course, equally important for ZILXI as it was for AMZEEQ.

Next slide. So I will start with some of that recent Awareness, Trial and Usage studies. So we present physicians with a blinded product profile. And
they get to read through the core attributes and side effect profile of the drug. And then we ask things like, what is your intent to prescribe? And
what we see here is that there is a high likelihood that in 75%, there's a high interest in the drug to prescribe, which is a good finding from this
study.

Next slide. And as we think about what ZILXI would then displace in the category, we see things like metronidazole, doxycycline, et cetera. This is
where we believe that we're going to take share in the market. And this is also as it was with AMZEEQ based on demand study, is that this is
disrupting the market. There is a great appetite for the product, and there is a lot of displacement going on, which shows that it's truly unique and
of interest to the physicians in our study.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next slide. So this is our ZILXI campaign. If you go to zilxi.com, you'll see that, that has been launched with a similar imagery. This campaign resonated
with physicians. The headline was seen as old, intuitive, drove desire to learn more about the product, the concept itself, the pictures, so to speak,
demonstrate a powerful tonality and a nod to known triggers, for instance, exercise and being out in the heat. So this concept really landed with
physicians in our research, and we feel like it's a great concept to represent what we're about to do in market.

Next slide. So as we think about the core visual aid and the story, this gets back to our positioning. So we go back to minocycline as a trusted
molecule, one that's been on the market for almost 50 years. MST is the cornerstone of the positioning. So this is something that no competitor
today or in the future can ever own. And we think that's an important anchor to the rest of the story. And then, of course, the ZILXI redefine topical
therapy for rosacea. As we go through the efficacy, the demonstrated safety of product, the tolerability on already sensitive scan. These are really
important attributes to the story. And so as we lay this story out, it really does make an impact.

I'm going to show you how in the next slide, why don't we go there. So as we do our core visual aid testing, one of the things that we wanted to
do is to provide a stimulus ahead of the participants seeing the core visual aid. We asked them to evaluate the target product profile, similar to
what we saw in the Awareness, Trial and Usage study that I showed previously and asked what their intent to prescribe was. And it was 6.9 out of
10 and not dissimilar to the 76% that we saw earlier. Then we went through the full detail, the complete story on ZILXI from start to finish. And
after that was complete, we asked again same prescribers what is your intent to prescribe? And it went up to 8.5 at 10. So roughly a 25% improvement
when they hear the story. That's important because as we go through our demand study, as we look at other market research we've done, we
recognize that the way that our reps are going to go out and communicate the story, the way that they're going to consume the story in other
medium is going to be really important in driving the penetration into the market. And so we believe that we have the right story. Obviously, you
want to see this separation when you do your testing, and we did.

Next slide. Let's switch to market access. So the majority of payment type in the branded space is either cash or commercial. I believe that the cash
is driven through synthetic access means by competitors. When we look at surrogates in the space, Finacea Foam, Oracea and Soolantra, we see
that the coverage is pretty good that they've been able to secure. And I think that's also a nod to the fact that there aren't a lot of options here and
that patients do tend to cycle between the products.

Next slide. As we did payer market research, we see that there is, based on the product profile that they reviewed, these are 10 payers that represent
over 300 million lives, which is most of the United States. These are self reported, of course. But we see the weighted average of unfavorability
greater than five. So there is a favorability metric for the profile for ZILXI. And based on the indication, what is the need, the payers believe that
there is a need for this product in the market, which is always a good sign when you do your market research. They also indicated that they would
expect the next planned price to be somewhere between $200 to $400, not dissimilar to AMZEEQ, in fact, because we price the product at parity
to AMZEEQ and because we already have contracts in place with most of the payers, we anticipated that response.

Next slide. So I'm very excited to announce on this call that we have now secured a contract with Express Scripts for coverage for their 26 million
lives on their preferred. They're basic and their flex preferred formularies that brings our coverage right now up to right around 46% of covered
lives. That contract went to effect today. So our contracting efforts are underway. We have also successfully negotiated with a smaller PBM, called
MC-Rx, that has a couple of million covered lives, and we have all of our other negotiations in process, and we feel good about the strategy and
also the market research feedback that we heard from them.

Next slide. As we think about our field force footprint. So we deployed 51 representatives in territories when we launched AMZEEQ. We always had
an eye on rosacea. So we did an overlap analysis back when we did our initial sizing. Knowing that we would have to modestly expand some targets.
And obviously, we did some refinements on how we targeted physicians in rosacea. But ultimately, we come up with about 4,000 or so targets. So
we've expanded a number of called on physicians by about 6%, up to 6,700, still very viable to reach these targets given this universe. Now 87%
of the ZILXI targets were already in our call deck. So we already have good relationships with almost 90% of the physicians that are going to impact
the ZILXI uptake. And I'm also happy to note here that we have captured, with our target universe, for ZILXI, 75% of the available diagnosed patients.
So this has been a great exercise to go through to make sure that we're leveraging the infrastructure, our marketing and sales apparatus does not
need to expand to bring 2 products to market, which is a great result.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next slide. So in summary, there's a significant unmet need in rosacea for both HCPs and patients. We hear it loud and clear in market research. We
believe that we have a very strong promotional story, and we expect that we're going to have good demand. And the surrogate support that with
the surrogate support, the fact that brands do get good uptake at launching, and we would expect the same here from ZILXI. And with that, I will
end and turn it back to Dave.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Matt. Well done. So let's just move right into the next portion of our discussion here, and that's Dr. Linda Stein Gold, Director of Clinical
Research at the Department of Dermatology at the Henry Ford Medical Center in Detroit. Dr. Stein Gold will take you through new and what's
coming in rosacea and review our clinical data as we believe, obviously, it's relevant since we're launching ZILXI effectively effective today. And
then obviously, we'll we get Dr. Stein Gold's thoughts on ZILXI and how she perceives it to be utilized and her treatment armamentarium for the
treatment of rosacea. Then obviously, we'll bring in the rest of the panel to get their thoughts as well. So Dr. Stein Gold, turn it over to you.

Linda Stein Gold
Okay. Well, thanks so much, really an honor and a privilege to be here and talk about rosacea. One of the things I love to talk about and love to
treat. So let's go to the next slide. I have been working with VYNE Therapeutics really for a long time kind of from early in the beginning and have
gotten to work with both of these products. So it's really been a privilege. I have been a consultant speaker as well as an investigator, but I also
work with a number of other companies and have done a number of other both acne and rosacea clinical trials.

Next slide. So if we want to think about treating rosacea, we have to look at the pathogenesis of the disease. We know that Rosacea is an inflammatory
skin disease. And it basically has an up regulation of the innate immune system. So when you look at the left-hand side of the slide, we have a
number of drugs that target different aspects in the pathogenesis of the disease. We also know that there is neurovascular dysregulation. So we
know that the blood vessels, especially on the surface of the skin dilate or become wide and the skin can then have more blood in the surface, and
that creates this flushing or this erythema of the skin. We generally need to use an alpha energic agonist or something that will constrict those
blood vessels to get control of that background erythema.

Next slide. So when a rosacea patient comes into our office, we have to look at them and decide how we're going to manage them.

Next slide. So basically, what we do is we look at the signs and the symptoms that are present. And we look at every rosacea patient individually.

If they have papules and pustules, right now, we really have metronidazole as azelaic acid, ivermectin or oral antibiotics, including subantimicrobial
dose doxycycline. If they have background erythema, we treat that generally separately with an alpha-adrenergic agonist either brimonidine or
oxymetazoline. If they have telangiectasias, they can cream all day, but they're probably not going to have an impact. So you really need a device
to try to get those to calm down. And if they have a phyma, a thickening of the skin and the glandular tissue, often they need surgery to really try
to get that under control.

Next slide. So there is a challenge in treating our rosacea patients because these patients have very, very sensitive skin. So it's very difficult for them
to tolerate topical therapy. A lot of them, if you apply a moisturizer even a sunscreen, they say, ugh, it stings, it burns, I can't tolerate it. The other
issue is compliance with any chronic skin disease. They have to treat it usually over the long term, and it's always best to simplify the regimen. If
we can give them one thing to do once a day, more likely that they'll find a way to incorporate it into their daily regimen.

Next slide. So we've used minocycline in both acne and rosacea for many, many years. We know that it's bacteriostatic, but it also has potent
anti-inflammatory properties. The problem is it's been very difficult to formulate a topical agent. We have to make a vehicle that allows this drug
to be stable, but we also have to have a cosmetically accessible vehicle, right?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So as we know -- next slide, topical minocycline foam in a 1.5% concentration has been FDA approved. And as Dave mentioned, is now being
marketed. And we had the results of 2 Phase III clinical trials that were published in one of our major journals, the American Academy of Dermatology
just this year.

Next slide. And when we look at the way these studies were designed, they were designed the way we see Phase III studies. There's always 2 sister
studies that are done simultaneously with different investigators, different patients. And we want to make sure there's reproducibility of the data.
We want to make sure that the data we see in one study is similar to what we see in the second study. The way these studies were designed for
every 2 patients who received a topical minocycline foam, 1 received the vehicle foam. These patients were treated once a day, every day for 12
weeks, and then these patients had the opportunity to go into an open-label study for an additional 4 new weeks. That was mainly a safety study,
but we also gathered some efficacy data as well.

Next slide. So when we look at the demographics, this is always important because we want to make sure that the patients who came into these
studies really mirror the type of patients we see when we're treating rosacea. And we really see that here. The mean age is around 50. The majority
of these patients were female, the majority are white. But we have to mention that you can see this in any race. Especially, we see it in African-American
patients, Hispanic patients, Asian patients. We can see it in anybody but it is more common in Caucasian patients. Now I want you to notice the
inflammatory lesion count at baseline. It's around 30 lesions at baseline. This is important because most studies when they're done have a much,
much lower inflammatory lesion account. This is very similar to what we saw with the ivermectin studies, but higher than what we thought with
the metro or azelaic acid or even Oracea.

And when we look at the IGA score, on the investigator's global assessment. And again, this is an [analyzed] assessment. We look at the patient at
baseline. We just get an overall feeling how bad is their rosacea. And we had about 85% of the patients who had moderate disease, about 15%
who had severe disease. What's important is the severe patients are difficult because we have to get them all the way down to clear, almost clear,
and that's a 3- or 4-grade improvement using just monotherapy.

Next slide. So how did they do? Well, we had 2 co primary endpoints. The first one is the absolute change in the inflammatory lesions. And first
thing I want you to notice is when you look at the study, they are very similar. So the studies performed fairly similarly. That means there's good
reproducibility of the data. The second thing I want you to note is that both studies had a statistically significant improvement in the active drug
as compared to the vehicle. The next thing I want you to note is that there is some vehicle effect. When we talk about topical therapy, we have to
understand that the topical agent is a marriage of the active ingredient and the vehicle. And this is very, very important, especially for rosacea. We
need to have a vehicle that actually carries some weight on its own. It's not placebo, it's vehicle.

And here, this vehicle was formulated to be very well tolerated. We also feel that this vehicle has kind of a healing process for the barrier. It hydrates
the skin. It helps to heal the skin barrier, which will also help to improve the rosacea. So we should expect that there will be some efficacy with the
vehicle by itself, but we also want to see that the active drug is statistically superior to the vehicle, and that is what we see.

Next slide. The other co-primary endpoint is looking to see how many patients got to clear or almost clear. And again, we're taking patients who
have moderate to severe rosacea at baseline, giving them 1 thing to do once-a-day and asking them to get all the way to clear or almost clear. And
again, we see about 50% of patients who've had this severity of disease at baseline, got all the way to clear or almost clear at the end of 12 weeks.
Again, we see there is some efficacy with the vehicle, but there is a statistically significant difference between the active and the vehicle, and this
was seen in both studies. A 50% result, getting -- half of those patients to clear or almost clear, is really quite a milestone for our monotherapy.

Next slide. So let's take a look at the percent change in inflammatory lesions over time. Here, we see, again, the studies were fairly similar. We see
a statistically significant decrease as early as week 4. And that difference from the vehicle is maintained over the course of the 12 weeks in both
studies.

Next slide. When we look at the difference in IGA success, we start to see a separation from vehicle at week 4 and which is statistically significant.
At week 8, only one of the studies actually reached statistical significance. The other one missed it by a little bit. And then by week 12 both studies
were statistically superior to the vehicle.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next slide. So you might say, okay, well, we put moderate patients, we put severe patients into the study. Is there a difference, or does it work for
both the moderate patients as well as the severe patients? So here, we separated out by baseline IGA. And the graph on the left, we look at the
inflammatory lesion count in the overall population and then in the moderate as well as the severe. And it was statistically significant in terms of
the reduction of inflammatory lesions, no matter how we slice the data. But noticed that those patients who had a lot of papules in the severe
patients had a very nice reduction with the active drug. And here's where you absolutely see the benefit of having this active drug in those patients
who will have a more significant disease.

Again, when we look at the IGA by baseline severity, statistically significant, whether it's moderate or whether it's severe. And you see with those
severe patients, it's very difficult for the vehicle by itself to get a severe patient all the way to clear or almost clear. So we have a nice delta or
difference, especially in the severe population.

Next slide. Okay. So it looks like the drug works. But as I mentioned, with our rosacea patients, we worry a lot about tolerability. We have to give
them something that they're going to be able to use and use it for long enough that they're going to start to see an efficacy result. So what's
interesting here is when we look at the overall summary of adverse events, we see the active drug and then we see the foam vehicle. Notice that
when we look at the number of subjects with any AE, it's actually higher in the vehicle than it is in the active. Treatment-emergent adverse events,
again, higher in the vehicle than it is would be active. Notice that there were 9 patients who discontinued due to an adverse event, 7 in the active
group and 2 in the vehicle group, and only 1 patient who discontinued was thought to have an adverse event, which was moderate itching that
was related to the drug. And actually, none of the serious adverse events were thought to be related to the drug.

Next slide. Okay. So what about the other thing that are not skin-related? Well, viral infections very similar, upper respiratory tract infection greater
in the vehicle. Headaches, notice that it's greater in the vehicle than in the active and minocycline, you might worry because taking systemically,
we worry about headaches, we did not see that in the active group. Diarrhea, slightly higher in the minocycline group and in the foam group, but
only 1% of the total population.

Next slide. When we look at the skin related -- skin treatment-emergent adverse events, we see the numbers are very, very low here. Overall, they
were very similar between the active minocycline group and the vehicle group. And just looking, all of these individually are less than 1%. So there's
no red flag. I do want you to note that there was 1 case of skin hyperpigmentation, and we haven't really talked about this, but 1 of the side effects
of taking systemic minocycline is that you can see hyperpigmentation of the skin. And so we worry if we're putting large doses in minocycline on
the skin topically, are we going to see minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation? The answer is no. We didn't see it in the acne trials, and we didn't
see it in the rosacea trials. Here, there was 1 case of skin hyperpigmentation, but this was thought to be post inflammatory hyperpigmentation
and not related to the minocycline.

Next slide. Okay. So what about dermal tolerability? So again, this is a rosacea patient, they're sensitive to begin with? How do you know they're
sensitive to begin with? Well, we looked at dermal tolerability, we looked at telangiectasias. We asked about stinging and burning, flushing, dryness,
itching, peeling, hyperpigmentation and then we looked at erythema. Notice -- and then the first the first grouping, the green line is none. The
blue is mild, the gray is moderate, and the dark blue is severe. So notice at baseline, most people had at least some stinging and burning at just
the baseline. When we look at how they did at 12 weeks, the vast majority of them had no stinging or burning after 12 weeks. Same thing with
flushing with dryness with itching. Notice at the end of 12 weeks, they didn't get more itching, they got less itching, peeling and desquamation,
again, also hyperpigmentation. You worry about using a topical minocycline, you might get hyperpigmentation over the course of 12 weeks, they
start to decrease. More patients are clear or none as compared with the baseline.

Then we separated out erythema and looked at that separately, and we -- here, we have a 5-point scale, clear, almost clear, mild, moderate and
severe. And at baseline, very few people were clear or almost clear in terms of their erythema. But notice that at the end of 12 weeks, about 45%
of patients were clear or almost clear in terms of their erythema.

Next slide. So it's also important to ask patients, what do you think about your treatment? And what we found was overall patients were satisfied
with their treatment. We found that 72% were satisfied or very satisfied with the minocycline foam. 90% thought it was easy to use or satisfied with
the ease of use. 63% were satisfied or very satisfied with the feel of it and 70% said they were satisfied or very satisfied with how this drug compared
with other drugs that they've used for their rosacea in the past.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next slide. So pictures, we're dermatologists. We love to see pictures. So here's a patient who had moderate disease at baseline. You can see a
number of inflammatory lesions. Look how red her knows is, especially with the perilesional erythema. Look at her at week 12. She has a beautiful
clearing that you can appreciate both from the side. She still has a little bit of telangiectasias on the nose. This other patient at baseline had moderate
disease. At week 12, she went down to a mild. Now when we look at her, she had an obvious improvement in her skin. She's obviously better, and
while relative looking at her might say, wow, you look good, but she is a treatment failure because she went from a moderate to a mild. So she
didn't achieve that 2-grade improvement to a clear or almost clear. So in real life -- she might be a study treatment failure. But in real life, she might
be a success because she's happy with the progress.

Next slide. Here are some other patients with moderate disease at baseline, and a gentlemen, went down to an almost clear. And this patient at
baseline had severe disease. So she had to have at least a 3-grade improvement. She had that by week 12, going all the way down to an almost
clear. And these pictures are typical of what I saw when we were doing our clinical trial as well.

Next slide. Okay. So as I mentioned, those patients who completed the Phase III clinical trial were eligible to go into the open-label long-term safety
study. I mean here, everybody gets the drug. They apply it once-a-day for an additional 40 weeks. So patients who started on the active drug had
a 52-week access to the drug.

Next slide. So of those patients who entered into the study, what's interesting to see is about 80% of them completed the long-term open-label
study. For a long-term study, that number is very, very good because you can lose people for any reason. When we look at why people discontinue
this study, the bulk of them lost a follow-up subject request. Very few, only 5 out of all of them stopped due to an adverse event.

Next slide. Okay. So the real goal of doing these long-term studies is safety. What we want to understand is, is there a new red flag that's going to
come up over having access to this drug over the course of an entire year that we didn't quite tease out in the 12-week Phase III trials. And the
bottom line was the majority of the treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and moderate. No serious adverse events were related to
treatment. And when we look at it, basically very similar whether they were started on the active drug or started on the vehicle and then transitioned
over, no new red flag was found during this part.

Next slide. And then again, looking at some of these other adverse events that occurred in the open-label upper respiratory tract infections. Nothing
really new, sinusitis, bronchitis. Again, looking at the headache, this remains low, vascular disease, hypertension. So there is no call out that would
cause us to have any cause for alarm that showed up when patients had access to this drug over the course of the entire additional 40 weeks.

Next slide. So what about tolerability? When we look at patients who use this drug for a full 52 weeks and look at where they were are when they
came in and where are they when they end up, telangiectasia is tough to treat unless you're going to use a device as we talked about. But looking
at stinging and burning, notice that the vast abort of these people, when they finish the study, 97% of them have no stinging or burning. Flushing,
57% have none. Dryness, 80% have absolutely no dryness. Another 18% have just a little -- considered almost clear in their dryness. Itching, almost
no itching remaining. The vast majority of people are clear or almost clear. And again, hyperpigmentation, these patients have access now to
minocycline for up to 52 weeks and notice that the hyperpigmentation, again, goes down.

So we don't see a flag that tells us that for having any type of minocycline hyperpigmentation, any of the hyperpigmentation that developed was
deemed to be post inflammatory or as a result of the inflammatory lesions. And then also, when we look at erythema, at baseline, the clear or
almost clear was only about 4%. When we look at the end of 52 weeks, we see that almost 60% of patients are clear or almost clear in terms of their
erythema.

Next slide. We did also monitor the efficacy of the drug. And what we find is when we look to see how many patients got to clear or almost clear,
in those patients who remained in the trial, we see those numbers continuing to go up. And by the end of the 52 weeks, in those people who
started on drug, who remained on drug, who continued through 52 weeks, almost 82% got to clear or almost clear. And more than 75% of the
ones who started on vehicle and then transitioned over to active drug and remained in the study got the clear or almost clear.

Next slide. So in terms of patient satisfaction at the end of the open-label study, we asked patients again, how are you feeling? How happy are you
with the drug? And overall, there was a high level of satisfaction. You notice the green is the very satisfied, and the gray is the satisfied. Overall

                                                                                                                                                                             
 satisfaction with the product is about 85% comparing it to other products, again, about 80% or so, hard to count in my head. And the vast majority
of them would recommend this product to a friend.

Next slide. So Ted went over the important safety information. For acne, it's very similar for rosacea. It's FDA-approved for adults for the papules
and pimples and bumps caused by rosacea. It's by prescription only. It has not been studied in children. It's to be used on the skin only. It shouldn't
be used by people who are allergic to it and not to be used by pregnant women and it is flammable. And then other side effects, very similar to
what we saw with the acne drug.

So that concludes my formal part of the presentation on rosacea, and I'll turn it back over to Dave.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Stein Gold. So I want to turn it over to Sarah and Michael to see if we have any questions from the audience. We're actually making
pretty nice time here. So we've got some availability for any additional questions on rosacea and ZILXI or also continued questions for AMZEEQ.
So Sarah and Michael, I'll turn it to you.

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. David, it looks like we have a live question from Tim Chiang at Northland Capital Markets.

Timothy Chiang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I had a question just about duration of treatment with AMZEEQ. I know you guys have overall highlighted the treatment success you've had. But
so I wanted to get your thoughts on how many administrations or how many canisters do you think a typical patient would use for AMZEEQ? And
also maybe the same question on ZILXI, given the fact that today is the first day it's commercially available.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Tim. Linda, do you want to start?

Linda Stein Gold
So it's really going to be variable, depending on the patient. For AMZEEQ, because people potentially might treat their face as well as their chest,
shoulders, back, they're probably going to use more. In rosacea -- generally, the rosacea just involves the face, so you're going to use less. I don't
know if we've calculated how many pumps there are or how much you get out of each tube, but generally, each prescription should last at least a
month. One of the issues is, how will patients really use this in real life? We don't have long-term maintenance data at this point. In real life, people
probably get themselves clear and then many doctors will recommend that they go to maybe 3 times a week or every other day or something like
as maintenance, but it's not approved that way, and we don't have data that way.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ted Lain
Yes. I don't know that I have much to add to Dr. Stein Gold. I think patients will also just take themselves off the drug that they get cleared just like
we've seen with psoriasis and AD, so -- and eczema. Look, we're not curing acne. We're treating it and controlling it. So there's -- it's not like we're
getting to a cure here. So I don't know that we have an end point necessarily unless patients age out of their acne. So it's difficult to say.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Moore, any additional thoughts or comments? I don't know if we got Dr. Moore there.

Unidentified Company Representative
Looks like Dr. Moore is on mute. Unmute yourself, please, doctor.

Julian Moore
Can you hear me now?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes, we got you.

Julian Moore
Okay. Excellent. Yes, I agree with what Linda and Ted have added. It's very variable, and it would be very, very difficult to ascribe a number to how
many cancels that their patient would go through. I mean, there's variability if it's face, chest and back, only involving the face, and then with ZILXI,
which typically will only be face. So I think there's tremendous variability there and to ascribe a number would be very difficult to do with any true
consistency.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. And I think just from a company perspective, it's early for us. I mean, as Matt alluded to earlier in his discussions, we're seeing now that 20%
of the prescription volume coming in is a repeat prescription. And obviously, that's encouraging that obviously, patients seem to be satisfied and
will continue to take the product itself. Trying to get a really clear view as to how many prescriptions or canisters that a patient will go through
during the course of the year, it's really just -- it's not an exact science. As Linda outlined, the unit itself is set up as a monotherapy. That could be
a little more, a little less, just depends on how widespread the disease is, much less of an exact science as what you see with oral-dose solids where
it's [a modest 30]. But we certainly are encouraged by what we're seeing in the underlying repeat usage data. And I think that does align with
certainly what we saw earlier in the market research on levels of satisfaction. We'll continue to do our analytics and put analysts around this as we
work through this year and into 2021. So hopefully, that helps, Tim.

Timothy Chiang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Yes. No, that helps. I just had a follow-up question. I know that you've talked a lot about payer access. And I wanted to sort of ask that to the
physicians. I mean have you ever come across patients who haven't been able to get access to AMZEEQ because of inadequate insurance? And
how big of an issue is that?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Sure. Ted, do you want to go first?

Ted Lain
Well, sure. There are patients who don't have access to AMZEEQ. I mean it happens. I think as Dr. Moore alluded to, we have specialty pharmacies,
which are these pharmacies that help us figure out the best way to get the prescription to the patient, and they do a great job. As I alluded to, it's
not a majority of the patients, that's for sure. It's a minority of patients. I couldn't put a number to it but I could certainly kind of ask around to our
primary medical assistants who deal with some of the callbacks from the issues of that, more than I do to give you a better idea. But I know it's a
minority as I just don't hear about it very much.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. Dr. Stein Gold or Dr. Moore, I don't know if you have any additional thoughts.

Julian Moore
No. I agree, 100%.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. I think our commercial team, Matt and the team have done a very nice job of trying to offset and to support base. That's obviously our mission.
Our goal is to make sure patients can get access to our product and physicians can prescribe a product without a lot of burden. It goes to our overall
strategy and approach when working with payers. And we have the tools in place to support the patients while we're working to get our products
on contracting various formularies. And so our coupon programs, we believe, have been helpful. In that regard, it helps patients that may not have
access to the drug yet because we're still in negotiations with various insurance payers to get the product and that physicians obviously can
continue to prescribe it, and we want that to happen. So that's always been part of our strategy, and we believe that we're -- it's a sound strategy
and now we're executing that.

Michael, any additional questions from the audience?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. Live question from Stacy Ku at Cowen & Company.

Kenneth Charles Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I think this is Ken coming in under Stacy's line. Ken Cacciatore, if you could hear me okay.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Right, Ken, we got it.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kenneth Charles Cacciatore - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Dr. Stein Gold, thanks for the presentation. Just wondering, we did see a slide where you had -- where the company listed out all the different
treatment options. Can you just talk about what is your go-to for rosacea, just, like, your standard of care in the process that you would work
through, and then obviously where ZILXI might fit itself in? And then wondering just about response rates. Obviously, there seems like a need. Can
you kind of quantify that need? How many patients are actually satisfied? And you didn't talk about topical steroids at all, but how many patients
are actually satisfied or get resolution and then would maybe not need to bring us to ZILXI versus -- is it a very -- is it almost all would end up
progressing to ZILXI?

And then also wondering your perspective, what went wrong with RHOFADE? And maybe the company could talk about that as well. So that
launched with good expectations, but clearly did not go well. So maybe get your perspective on the company's perspective on RHOFADE and how
will do this differently.

Linda Stein Gold
Okay. So there was a time when people used to talk about rosacea as kind of a made up disease that Galderma made up to sell metronidazole or
topical METROGEL. And when we look at the efficacy that we used to have, it wasn't very good. Some people call it, used to call it like a branded
placebo because it wasn't working well. We have -- and it works some. Azelaic acid, is an acceptable alternative. It's [easy] very irritating. And we
have other formulations that work. But it's fine that for rosacea patient who has a tolerability issue, it can be quite challenged.

The oral agents, Oracea, for some patients that does well. But when you actually look at the efficacy, the efficacy is not that outstanding. So Soolantra
was really the first of the newer drugs that really made a difference. They took patients who had moderate to severe disease. They studied it as
monotherapy. They went head-to-head with branded metronidazole and showed superiority.

Your coming -- VYNE is coming in now with the drug. And when you look at the clear or almost clear data, you're getting to about 50% at the end
of 12 weeks, which is higher than anything we've seen in those very rigorous clinical trials. So they're coming in really with great data behind them.
When we look at tolerability, which is something that has to be there, the tolerability was great. And then when you have side effects and the
vehicle is higher than the active, you could say, wow, that doesn't usually happen. And that only goes to the fact that the drug has the
anti-inflammatory properties. So it's calming your skin down even better than just using a vehicle. And Ted mentioned when he was talking about
using minocycline for acne, there's a lot of ingredients that were formulated and it's the vehicle that made it very well tolerated.

So hopefully, I answered your question as to where we are right now and where I think this will fit in. I think this will fit in quite well. A lot of patients
who don't have the newer drugs are not satisfied because the drugs that we've had in the past really just don't work.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. And I think I could just offer a quick thought just on metronidazole since Dr. Stein Gold brought it up. It's despite the fact that it has its challenges
in terms of effectiveness, there's still 1 million-plus prescriptions a year prescribed for rosacea. And I think it goes to what Matt outlined earlier in
his discussion. There really just hasn't been a lot of innovation in the space. And we're obviously very encouraged by the safety and efficacy data
outlined. And I think the research shows it. It could have the potential to be very disruptive to the space, and I think it just goes to the points that
Dr. Stein Gold, Dr. Lain, Dr. Moore have made, that there's just not a lot of alternatives out there. And in the absence of that, you're just going to
continue to go to what's available. And we think we've got something that has a potential to address those unmet needs, not just for the reduction
of the inflammatory lesions associated with rosacea but obviously, the erythema data, which is a hallmark for patients that present with rosacea.
Dr. Stein Gold talked about it. We were very encouraged by the improvement in erythema.

And that Ken goes to your question about RHOFADE. I'll offer our thoughts because, obviously, we spent a lot of time looking at it. RHOFADE is a
vasoconstrictor. It is indicated for erythema associated with patients that have rosacea. The data shows it does not seem to have any impact on
reduction of the lesions. And so if you -- a patient -- if a large number of patients, if not the majority of the patients that have rosacea have both
                                                                                                                                                                             
 the lesions that they're trying to address as well erythema associated with it, then that goes to the notion of having multiple products perhaps that
you have to prescribe, multiple co-pays, et cetera.

We're encouraged by what we've seen in our clinical trials with ZILXI in the efficacy in reducing lesion counts and getting clearance rates of almost
1 out of every 2 patients. But also the -- which is the rather profound impact on your curtailing erythema, improving erythema over the course of
time, not just in the 12-week studies, but obviously taking it out for 52 weeks at all end points. So I'll turn it over to Dr. Stein Gold, Dr. Lain and Dr.
Moore for any additional color around that. But perhaps Dr. Stein Gold, do you want to go first?

Linda Stein Gold
So I think one of the problems with the launch was there really wasn't a launch. And I believe that this drug came out in a transition period. So I'm
not sure that it ever got the attention that it truly deserves. But Dave, as you mentioned, this is a drug that is strictly for the background erythema
in rosacea. There are some studies that say that alpha-adrenergic agonist like brimonidine and oxymetazoline, when used in combination with the
topical anti-inflammatory might make the condition even better. But as a monotherapy, it's really just going to be for the pink face.

Ted Lain
Yes. What I'm learning from this is that analysts like to ask full part questions. You guys are amazing with the number of questions you ask at the
same time. So if I could just touch on this, just the opportunity for topical minocycline for rosacea. So Linda, I'm sure you have as well, there's been
3 different topical minocycline products that gone through development. VYNE has the only one that's come through to commercialization, but
each one of them I have been so impressed with the efficacy. Of course, again, I'm blinded in the trials. But the topical minocycline, mark my words,
it will be a home run for rosacea. It will be a home run for rosacea because everything that we had just doesn't work as well, okay? And we've seen
the reduction in erythema as well as the reduction in lesion count.

Now we -- when we look at RHOFADE, I'm a big RHOFADE believer. I still prescribe it just about in combination with everything because I agree
with Dr. Stein Gold that it works the best when it's used in conjunction with another product. It is a cosmetic part for many, and it's priced that way.
I think they're priced right now at $50 a tube and that lasts for 1 to 2 months. And I don't know what the kind of recidivism is on the prescriptions
that I write, but I think it's quite high because patients get hooked on it. The nice thing is our member from the trials, from the trials, I believe we
have them use it daily for 28 days, and then we have them come back either 14 or -- 2 weeks or 4 weeks later after stopping. And many of those
patients didn't have redness that recurred at that point. So there's a physiologic and/or anatomic change that occurs with the use of oxymetazoline
in my view.

So I'm a big believer in RHOFADE. I think, as Linda said, the launch was hampered by issues with the company. It has been relaunched a couple of
times. And for those of us that are believers and are users of it, I think we still believe in and are lucky that we still are able to prescribe it, honestly.
So those are my 2 cents.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Lain. Dr. Moore? We got you there, Dr. Moore?

Julian Moore
Can you hear me now?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. Now we got you.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Julian Moore
Excellent. So my vantage point being from South Florida, rosacea is just a tremendous issue, and I have a large number of patients that I treat for
rosacea. And I will tell you that the sentiment -- and -- okay, it's a chronic condition, so we're going to be treating for a while. But the sentiment, I
want to echo Linda and Ted and that patients, they don't seem to be overwhelmingly overjoyed with their therapeutic options. So from a standpoint
of ZILXI, this should be a game changer. And again, a welcome one because the landscape and space as it stands now for rosacea, just -- I don't
find it well. In fact, I can help control and relative to RHOFADE, I've always had to use that in combination with other things to really get decent
efficacy. Monotherapy, I just didn't see well factor with it. And again, we know based on its mechanism of action that -- it will help with the redness
which is a significant component of most patients with rosacea. But being in South Florida, again, there's such a chronicity rosacea on my rosacea
patients that they're constantly seeking options that are going to be more efficacious.

So I really cannot wait to get my hands on ZILXI from -- geographically, I really -- I struggle with that one in terms of getting my patients to be --
not that I can't control them, but I want to see that overwhelmingly ecstatic outcome and happiness from my patients, like I do with AMZEEQ. So
I'm really looking forward to ZILXI, and again, relative to RHOFADE. It has the efficacy in terms of minimizing the erythema redness component,
but it was always with additional -- many additional things, too.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Moore. Michael, any additional questions?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. We have a live follow-up from Louise Chen.

Louise Alesandra Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst & MD
Great. So what percentage of your rosacea patients would you prescribe ZILXI? Or what are you expecting from that perspective? And then for
VYNE management, what are the synergies of the ZILXI launch plus AMZEEQ? How is your sales force positioned? Or will we need to add additional
reps here?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. So why don't -- Matt, if -- why don't you address the second question on the commercial synergies? And then I'll turn it back over to the
panel and their expectations around usage and percent usage and how it will fit into their armamentarium. But why don't you take the first one
on the synergies, which we obviously believe we've got excellent synergies? But why we built the field force the way we did from the start. Why
don't you take that one?

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Sure. Louise, so the overlap -- so just to kind of put things in perspective, on our current call on universe for AMZEEQ, 87% of those called on targets
are also ZILXI targets. So it's a really important point that our overlap with AMZEEQ is quite good. We had to add roughly 500 to 600 targets into
our call universe. We do cover now 75% of the total patient volume in rosacea. And as a synergy, it's a nice complement to talk about the acne
patients and the gemci component and the active component and then also transition over to rosacea or vice versa, depending on the target. But
these are synergistic call points we can anchor around the positioning of minocycline as a molecule and molecule stabilizing technology as an
anchor for both and then talk about the different patient populations and the stories, as I mentioned.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I think it's also helping us out, Louise, in our discussions with the payers. This is -- we've spent a lot of time with payers, both on the business side,
but obviously on the clinical side, taking them through the drug itself. So this is the first topical tetracycline, topical minocycline product available.
And so we've already gone through that hurdle in large part with a lot of P&C groups, so as we're -- for AMZEEQ. And so as we're now having the
discussions and negotiations with ZILXI, that's been helpful for us because it's not educating them on a completely different product. It's different
concentrates, different prevalence rates. But that's been helpful to us. And I think that's evident that we got ZILXI on formulary for Express Scripts
before we actually launched the drug. So that was helpful for us.

Why don't I turn it to Dr. Lain, and Dr. Moore, Dr. Stein Gold just on -- I know these are always tough questions asked about percentages, but maybe
in broad strokes, how you envision ZILXI to fit into your armamentarium. So Dr. Lain, do you want to go first?

Ted Lain
Yes. I think it's going to quickly become first-line for me. I mean this is a drug that I've been excited about for a long time. So I see it kind of very
quickly becoming first line. As I said, I tend to combine things with RHOFADE. So I see a combination therapy approach happening. But it may even
take away from my Oracea requirement as well because usually, there's a combination therapy approach that we use for rosacea where it's Oracea.
Oracea and Soolantra together have been the kind of the primary combination I've used, but with ZILXI now available, I can see that overtaking it.
So I'm not going to back down from my original statement. I think it will be first-line, perhaps, monotherapy most likely combined with RHOFADE.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks. Dr. Moore?

Unidentified Company Representative
Dr. Moore, please unmute your line.

Julian Moore
Can you hear me now?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. There we go. Yes.

Julian Moore
All right. So I'm very excited to get my hands on it. And I'll tell you the lines I have with my rosacea patients will receive ZILXI because I want to see
the mirroring of those clinical trials. And again, being in South Florida and having so many patients with rosacea that just are controlled and
relatively happy, we want to see tremendous success. I want to see patients overjoyed. So I can't wait to get my hands on to try it out. I'll tell you I
will be trying it with most of my rosacea patients as they follow-up and certainly getting a sense for clinically how they're doing with the current
regimen and that typically will include Oracea with Soolantra and maybe RHOFADE or even metronidazole in certain cases.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And again, just because of the fact that I don't have what I want to consider to be overwhelmingly clinical success with these patients certainly
control, ZILXI is going to be my go-to, to sort of really see if I can get some home runs with my patients as opposed to single or double. So I'm really
looking to get my hands on and try it. So I will be trying with most of my patients right off the bat.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And Dr. Stein Gold?

Linda Stein Gold
I agree. I can't see a reason why it wouldn't be first-line for (inaudible). I would use it as monotherapy in these patients as well.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks. Michael, any additional questions?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. Follow-up from David Amsellem at Piper.

David A. Amsellem - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So you may have covered this, and this is for the featured speakers, the KOLs. You may have covered this in terms of how you're going to use ZILXI
in practice. But I wanted to sort of dig a little deeper. I mean you have brimonidine, you have ivermectin. You have these older products that are
used with relative frequency. So do you envision a role for ZILXI, sorry if I mispronounced it, do you envision a role for it primarily as monotherapy?
Or do you envision some type of paradigm that's similar to Oracea where you're combining it with an anti-retinitis product like brimonidine or
RHOFADE? Help us understand how you think about it? And is there going to be sort of an individualization and in terms of how ZILXI is used in
practice?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Stein Gold, why don't you go first this time?

Linda Stein Gold
So you asked 10 dermatologists, you'll get 10 different answers. It's -- it's the art of medicine, and everybody's going to use it, how they want to,
and it's going to depend on the patient. Somebody comes in and they have to get clear now, probably start them on combination therapy to try
to get them clear yesterday. Somebody comes in just a regular patient. They have a busy life. Monotherapy is okay to them. There's not a reason
for me not to use this as monotherapy because we saw that it kicked in quickly. And in half of the patients, they got to clear or almost clear in 3
months. If somebody has excessive background erythema, I might add in an alpha-adrenergic agonist, probably oxymetazoline because brimonidine
has a risk of some [kind of] erythema associated with it. So everybody is going to do it differently. And the beauty of it is there's not a treatment
regimen that it wouldn't fit in with. There's not something that you say you can't use these together.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Dr. Stein Gold. Dr. Moore?

Julian Moore
Yes. So I agree. Given the said patient, there are going to be different variables that will play a role in terms of how they present and what their
expectations will be based on their personal life. For me as a clinician, I do foresee it again based on the trials and what Dr. Stein Gold presented
today, that if monotherapy should be where it should fit in. However, again, we practice medicine as an art form, and we're going to see as we go
through. I will be very interested to see it monotherapy -- how it works. And that doesn't mean that I'm not going to try it in combination with
some other products. But I think that it will -- as time goes on, (inaudible) out and we will see because this is how it works on the clinical side.
Medications are released and we look at the trials, and then there's going to be the real-world application, where we'll see what happens. And it's
usually -- it usually will kind of dictate prescribing habits. And again set clinician and set patients, there will be those variables. But my plan will be
to try monotherapy. And if I have to combine it with other things, certainly, not an option -- is an option.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. And then finally, about Dr. Lain.

Ted Lain
Yes. I think -- I mean, look, monotherapy rosacea, but a lot of our rosacea patients have an overlap syndrome with seborrheic dermatitis. It's not
uncommon for us to see bumps along with dryness. And that's the overlap syndrome that I'm discussing, I'm talking about. And we haven't really
had a great monotherapy knockout drug for both conditions. So I'm really excited to use this in our overlap patients because I think this will really
help us to treat both with one and maybe avoid some of the other -- either higher cost medications, topicals that we use that are anti-inflammatory
or even topical steroids that we sometimes have to use to get the seborrheic dermatitis under control, so -- and systemic antibiotics. So I'm excited
to get started with ZILXI, not only for monotherapy for rosacea, as I mentioned, in combination with oxy, but also for our overlap patients.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Thanks, Dr. Lain. Michael coming to the home stretch. Any additional questions for the panel?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. There's one more live question from Oren at H.C. Wainwright. And then we have a couple of written questions we'll take from the web.

Oren Gabriel Livnat - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst
Okay. So I have a couple of questions. Just on the cost side, all of you has spoken to, at least on the AMZEEQ front, having really good access, only
a minority of patients not having -- not being able to get the product. And I'm just curious what your perception is of cost sensitivity in general
amongst your patients, especially when we're talking about more chronic patients in the rosacea side of the equation. Are you hearing back saying,
look, can you prescribe something that's cheaper for me? I can get a generic drug for $5. This other thing, even with the coupons, is costing me
$40. And I do have a follow-up, but answer that first.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Lain, do you want to start?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Ted Lain
Yes. Okay. Okay. So I think the price sensitivity is an issue. I think with the advent of these direct-to-consumer website-based compounding
pharmaceuticals such as Hims and Hers and Apostrophe and Curology where patients are paying $75, let's say, for them to be seen by a physician
in the system and get something compounded that we don't know the stability of. They're willing to pay $75 there all day, every day. And so when
they come in and they see a dermatologist and they're giving something which we know is manufactured correctly and has the studies to prove
it, I don't see a lot of pushback in the $40 to $50 range.

A lot of our adult females, for example, the retinoids aren't covered for them and so it's $75, and you don't get pushed back. So I think that the price
sensitivity is really not a huge issue in the patients that I see. Of course, this could be very personal. But in my patient population, I just don't see a
huge issue with that at all.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. Dr. Stein Gold?

Linda Stein Gold
So there's a difference between treating patients who have an acute condition and treating somebody who has a chronic disease. If somebody
comes in and they have Poison Ivy, it's going to go away. I'll be a hero whether I give them a branded steroid or a generic steroid or if they need
oral steroids. It's going to go away. It's fine. It doesn't matter. If I give them a generic drug and it -- the consistency is a little bit gloppy and heavy
and they don't like it, it's okay because, you know what, you use it for a week and then it's done. When somebody has a chronic condition like
rosacea or acne, they're more sensitive to the type of medication that we give them. They want somebody -- something that's cosmetically elegant.
They want something that's going to work. They've tried other things.

So that's why if I'm going to write a branded drug, the samples are important because that does help the patient to understand what you're giving
them. And usually, I'll say to them, I'm giving you this drug, which is a brand-new drug for these reasons. I want you to have it because I know your
skin is going to be able to tolerate it. And I know that it's going to work well for you. And I think that kind of an educated consumer is great. So with
a chronic condition like rosacea, I don't think if the coupon card was $75, that's okay. They'd spend that over-the-counter at Target anyways.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And Dr. Moore?

Julian Moore
Yes. So I agree. When you educate a patient that they're going to be getting a preparation that's been studied extensively and undergone several
sort of hoops to get to where it is to market in terms of its safety and efficacy and tolerability. The patients are very astute. And I agree with my
fellow colleagues that, that sweet spot between $35 and $75 is usually okay for them. And again, I think that's where patient and education comes
in. And once you explained -- and a lot of these patients, again, because of the chronicity of the condition, have been on other medications. So
they have a point of reference to compare vehicle, to compare the tolerability and even efficacy. So I don't really get a lot of pushback, I'll tell you,
with the branded medicine and when the efficacy is there, absolutely none. So it's not a big issue, but you do have some patients who'll bring it
up, but it's not the biggest issue that I have to face with it.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Oren Gabriel Livnat - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Healthcare Analyst
Right. Okay. And this might be related, but maybe for the company, and more specifically, all of the doctors today have talked about rosacea, in
particular, the combo of drugs they're using. And I don't think they brought up metronidazole too often, right? Yet upfront, we can see the scripted,
and you highlighted, Dave, that there's 1 million prescriptions a year of that. So I'm just curious, is that a cost issue and that there's x number of
patients out there that can only get the old cheap stuff? Or is that -- because that's primary care docs prescribing that stuff and not you guys? And
so what would it take long-term with your targeted 50 to 60 reps, how does that eventually translate to this drug being used much more broadly?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. No, I'll offer some initial thoughts and turn it over to Matt. Indeed, there are loss of prescriptions from metronidazole that are written every
year. We do believe that's an opportunity for us as we build our base of business to continue to grow share and expand our business. So when we
look at -- we believe that we've got a product that can be very helpful for physicians and for patients and to address the barriers, the unmet needs
and challenges that Dr. Stein Gold, Dr. Lain and Dr. Moore have spoken about. So sure, when you take a look at it, we can look at just sort of a finite
market at just the branded products, which is robust. But we think of it in terms of the product itself. I think in part, there hasn't been a lot of new
innovative products to the category. And as we are having discussions with payers, that seems to be resonating with them that our product can
fit into the -- obviously, the benefit plans, but also be meaningful for physicians in armamentarium. So we certainly view the entire category as an
opportunity for us to bring a new and innovative product like ZILXI at the market. So Matt, perhaps you can offer some invisible thoughts.

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Yes. So as we look at these surrogates in the market access paradigm, we see that some have either prior authorization or step therapy as a
requirement. So it makes me wonder how much of that metronidazole is required for step therapy before getting to a brand. And maybe I'll take
it over to the physician panel to see if my assumption is correct. Maybe Dr. Stein Gold we'll start with you.

Linda Stein Gold
Yes. So there's a number of reasons why metronidazole is written. And none of them are that we think that this is a superior drug. It's written
because a patient has Medicare or Medicaid, and that's the only thing that's covered. It's written because maybe it's a dermatologist who doesn't
know the newer drugs or hasn't seen data with the newer drugs, and that's all that they know. And I don't think it's going to necessarily be on the
shoulders of the reps to get this out. I mean some of it is. But we have so many meetings. And our meetings -- given our COVID environment where
everything is virtual, we have thousands of people signed up for these meetings, and you guys are getting a lot of play in acne symposium, rosacea.
So there's a lot of talk. So even if your rep doesn't touch somebody, they're going to hear about it if they get any CME at all, they're going to hear
about it.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Dr. Lain?

Ted Lain
I have nothing to add. I totally agree with Linda.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Dr. Moore, I guess?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Julian Moore
That is correct. She summed it up very nicely.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Great. Michael, I think we're down to about the last minute or 2. So I'm not sure if we have any other questions, but maybe we got time for
one more and then probably good for us to wrap it up.

Unidentified Company Representative
Yes. David, a couple of related questions that came in from the web that I think it would be interesting to get the answers to.

I think, first of all, how has telemedicine being for the treatment of acne and rosacea in clinical practice. And then do the doctors anticipate using
telemedicine going forward once the pandemic is over?

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Good. It's a good way to wrap it up. So why don't we just go around the horn with the panel. Dr. Moore, why don't we start with you?

Julian Moore
Absolutely. So telemedicine essentially revolutionized our ability to get to our patients during this COVID environment. There was a tremendous
amount of trepidation for patients coming into offices. There are recommendations by the CDC. So I'll tell you, telemedicine was heaven-sent and
truly a life saver because you can very accurately analyze a patient with acne and rosacea via telemedicine. So in short, telemedicine has been
fantastic throughout the COVID environment. I'll tell you, I have -- the patients have now returned and are coming in for live visits. But there are
some who still enjoy telemedicine. Some are still doing telemedicine as well, even though the COVID has sort of tied it down, in a sense, in certain
locations. I still do telemedicine, I still have live visits. So I think it's been fantastic and really helpful.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Great. Dr. Lain?

Ted Lain
Yes. I mean a life saver during the shutdown. Since then, the number of telemedicine visits have waned to the point of maybe 1 a day at this point.
So really not kind of back to where it was previously, not a huge part of our practice at all. Some of that is going to hinge on whether reimbursement
continues to be at the level of in-office visits in the future. But great to have now. Nice to have. I don't know that it's revolutionizing anything as
we get back in model.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
And Dr. Stein Gold.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Linda Stein Gold
Absolutely agree. I did all telemedicine at 1 point, then maybe half. Now I do none. And it's -- everything is going to depend on reimbursement.
Once it stops getting reversed, it will shut down completely. So for now, it works.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Okay. Well, first of all, I want to thank everyone for attending and joining this conference. This has been a great event. I've had a chance to watch
a number of participants. I can see it on the screen. And we've actually gone for full 3 hours, and there's been -- it's almost the same level of
participation since minute one. So I think that's a credit to, obviously, our physician attendees. Fantastic job providing great comprehensive reviews,
of the market of the treatment algorithms, on regimens that are available and obviously, on the data for our product, AMZEEQ and ZILXI.

I want to thank each of you, Dr. Stein Gold, Dr. Moore and Dr. Lain for doing a fantastic job and obviously sharing your personal experiences. And
so thanks, again. Thanks to the team in life science for putting this event together. Logistically, it was a lot of work. And then last but not least, I
want to thank the audience that have spent time, 3 hours of your day to join in on this call. Hopefully, you found it to be helpful and productive,
and we look forward to as a company providing you updates as we continue to grow our progressive business. Again, exciting time for us here
with VYNE, and we're excited to be launching ZILXI today. Thanks again, everyone, for joining.

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Thank you.

David T. Domzalski - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Have a great rest of the week.

Matthew Wiley - VYNE Therapeutics Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Thank you very much.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today's Burford Capital 2020 Interim Results Conference Call. My name is Jordan, and I'll be coordinating your
call today. (Operator Instructions)

I'm now going to hand over to Chris Bogart, CEO, to begin. Chris, please go ahead.

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
Thank you very much, Jordan, and hello, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us today for this call. As usual, with me are Jon Molot, Burford's
Chief Investment Officer and my Partner and Co-Founder; and Jim Kilman, our Chief Financial Officer. This is a very exciting day for us. Not only do
we get to talk to you about some terrific results, but we were also able to announce this morning that we are done with the U.S. listing process.
We have in -- U.S. Securities [problems are] gone effective with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of yesterday afternoon. And that
lets us have a little period of mechanics now and then our shares will start to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on the 19th of October, in
addition, of course, to continuing to trade in London. So that's the end of a long and multi-month process, and we're very pleased with that outcome
indeed, and I'll talk a little bit more about in a moment.

But turning to Burford and what we've been able to accomplish, I'm looking at Slide 3. And really, if you look at the vignettes on that slide, the
numbers really speak for themselves here. We had a great half year, really sort of the best in our history for investment performance. And before I
even turn to some numbers, let's just set in context what has happened here. Burford has obviously been on a growth trajectory for a number of
years, but starting in 2016 was when you really saw a big sharp uplift in the -- in our ability to upsize the portfolio and develop a large and robust
portfolio of litigation assets. And obviously, within that period, since litigation is not the world's fastest process, we, just like you, have been waiting
for the investments in those vintages to start to produce. And what you saw in the first half of the year is that they really delivered. And they didn't
just deliver, what they did was underlined our ability to produce outsized returns over and over again.

Looking just at one group of related cases, we produced $423 million in group realizations. That's a 56% IRR on those investments, return on
invested capital of 194%. And that just feeds into what is now an 11-year track record at Burford. And within that track record, we've now generated
more than $1.6 billion of investment recoveries and that is in our core litigation finance business. That's not including any of the other adjacent
strategies like complex strategies, for example, that we also run. And on that $1.6 billion, across 11 years, we've produced very consistent IRRs right
now at 32%. And our returns -- our nominal returns actually went up to 97% return on invested capital.

And so to underline the point that this is the way this business works, this combination of settlements and outsized wins accompanied by a few
losses, we now have 23 separate investments in our history that have produced more than a 200% return on invested capital. And we've done all

                                                                                                                                                                             
 of this in this 6-month period without any contribution, without a single dollar of contribution from our YPF-related assets, really showing the
depth and breadth of the overall business. And it's not -- these are not just paper gain, this is cash. Our cash balances have gone up. The large case
wins that I referred to have been paying steadily. We've got receivables in the second half that have been paying steadily. And just as a reminder,
this is very characteristic in litigation for you to win something and then for there to be a period of time to get the cash. But 85% of the time, our
receivables pay within 6 months. And in fact, if you look at the receivable balance at the end of last year, at the end of 2019, virtually all of those
receivables are all paid now.

So we've got increases in profitability, increases in cash and more cash coming in the door. Before I turn you over to Jon to hear about the portfolio
and our progress in more depth, let me just touch on a couple of nonfinancial issues. So as I said earlier, we're very excited to be done with the U.S.
listing process. And I think there's no real debate that the combination of the SEC process and the New York Stock Exchange process is the most
rigorous regulatory process in the world. So that's a significant check for Burford. And I think that we're excited not only to have been involved in
that process, but with the opportunities that we think await us being able to access the domestic investment capital in the U.S., which has not
historically been able to buy Burford stock. So we're excited about what that brings us in the future. And as you saw, we've expanded our Investor
Relations team to take advantage of that. In addition to Rob Bailhache, who has been with us in various capacities for years, we've added Jim Ballan
in the U.S., a long time specialty finance, investor relations and sell-side analyst. And so for those of you in the U.S., we hope that you'll work with
and get to know Jim.

And as I said, the trading starts on the 19th of October. For those shareholders who have seen the various communications about the mechanics
involved in this, I, frankly, have to apologize on behalf of stock exchanges. As a former tech executive, I have been pretty taken aback at how
cumbersome and archaic these processes can be. And we regret the fact that you need to go through a little bit of complexity now yourselves for
this to happen. And we also regret that the language describing this process is not quite our usual crisp clear pros, but rather was, frankly, foisted
on us by the exchanges. So all I can say is we think the long-term benefit here dramatically outweighs the short-term inconvenience that you'll
experience, but we do apologize for the fact that there is a little bit of inconvenience along the way.

And with that, let me turn you over to Jon Molot to talk about the portfolio.

Jonathan T. Molot - Burford Capital Limited - CIO
Thanks, Chris, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to speak with us. As Chris says, we're really pleased with being able to report these first
half results to you. And if -- I'll be speaking to Slide 4 to begin with, but I do want to step back and echo something Chris said, which is we're now
11 years in, and we have produced, on a fairly consistent basis, very attractive risk-adjusted returns, right? We've -- our IRRs hovered around 30%.
We've had returns on invested capital that are quite attractive that -- and we've told people in the past, we'll tick up or tick down depending upon
the duration of matters, right? We end up with higher returns on invested capital when things run long and end up going to trial and either produce
big wins or, as Chris says occasionally, losses. And we'll have lower returns on invested capital, but still quite attractive ones with attractive IRRs for
the matters that settle earlier on.

But we've generally produced consistent results from period to period such that no one period after 11 years can you say, ""Oh, that was a fluke.""
We have enough realizations that everybody understood this is the nature of the business. And I think probably the other thing that investors
would have recognized is we've grown significantly over the past several years. In 2016, '17, '18, '19, we've put out much more capital. We've grown
the team. We did it to meet demand because law firms and corporate clients needed our capital and the legal services market had previously been
ignored by the capital markets. So we saw tremendous opportunity, and we added people, but we did it in a very careful way to target the same
risk-adjusted returns to make sure that in meeting the demands of our clients, we were able to include in our portfolio of assets opportunities that
were just as attractive as the ones that had come before.

And I've been very confident of that process and the team and have said as much on these calls twice a year. But I could understand that for
investors, the question they'd like to see answered is, okay, you've grown the business quite significantly. We love that. Are you able to generate
the same level of returns on this larger asset base that you've historically been able to provide? Have you had to sacrifice quality? Is there some
sacrifice in the team? Or are you able to really keep up that level of returns just on a broader scale? And I think the answer with these results is a
resounding yes.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And if you look at Slide 4, on the upper left, you see the acceleration of realizations, which has been going from 2016 through 2020, each first half,
it's been a larger pool of realizations than the one before. And if you look on the lower left, you see that those larger sizes of realizations have
translated into larger realized gains. And it's a significant uptick from 2019 to 2020. '17 -- first half of '17, '18 and '19 were quite impressive. We were
very pleased with them. But you look at the realized gains just for the balance sheet, putting aside the group for the first half of 2020, and it's a big
step up from prior years, and we're really quite pleased with that.

On the upper right of Slide 4, you can see a little bit of what I described, how the portfolio has grown and have we seen realizations from those
larger pools. And just as you'd expect when you look at that slide, of course, you're going to see a larger portion of the 2015 vintage generating
returns than you would of a later vintage, right? As you get to more recent, less mature vintages, you're going to see a larger portion of the
deployment still outstanding. With the earlier vintage, you see a larger portion of the vintage has concluded and generated realizations. With the
one caveat, which I'll return to or one exception, which isn't a caveat, it's a positive that 2019 has already, right, the vintage of investments put on
in 2019 has already delivered substantial realizations to you, our investors, in first half of 2020. And I'll get back to that in a few minutes. In the lower
right of Slide 4, I think it's important to note the composition of income from our capital provision assets, right? We've heard investors who have
been very impressed with our results in the past, but they really wanted to see large realizations and they wanted to see it from non-YPF assets.

And if you look at the composition of income in the first half of 2019 broken down into how much was realized versus unrealized, how much came
from YPF-related assets versus non, you see the balance there. If you look at 2020 in the first half, 0 came from YPF assets. It's all from non-YPF
assets, and the vast bulk of it is from realizations as opposed to fair value adjustments, right? You've got $251 million and $65 million of that fair
value and $186 million of it is realized gains.

I would like to say, though, that $65 million in fair value adjustments is nothing to sneeze at, and it's something that I'm quite pleased about. When
we put out an RNF in April, just updating the market on progress in our cases, we pointed out, we had already enjoyed some successes in cases. A
portion of which were in matters that were very close to being final and therefore, could lead to realizations quite rapidly. And indeed, that's come
to pass. We've enjoyed those realizations in the first half of 2020, but there were many others that we said we've enjoyed successes that could be
trial wins, but they'll be in appellate process. And we were very pleased with the progress of the portfolio in those cases, but we did not expect
final realizations during this period. And so the fair value adjustments, we've said repeatedly over time, only take into account a fraction of the
income we would realize when those matters concluded if they conclude successfully.

So the fact that we have progress in cases, trial wins and such, from matters that are not fully realized is a positive, not a negative. But of course,
investors wanted to see realized gains, and we've delivered there as well. So we're just very pleased with how the portfolio has performed in the
first half of 2020.

Turning to Slide 5. There's a little more granularity on the breakdown of where the realizations came from. On the left side, you see it broken down
group-wide and on the balance sheet, and you see a further breakdown between realizations from our capital provision direct portfolio and the
capital provision indirect portfolio. And it may be worth a reminder on capital provision indirect that we've long said that the capital provision
indirect portfolio is not as long term. It's a shorter-term or medium-duration asset class where we have much greater control over the progress of
the litigation and over the ability to settle. And we were able to, on 4 assets, which constituted about 70% of the portfolio of outstanding cash as
of December 2019, turn those into cash, demonstrating the medium-term liquidity from this strategy, which we've always said was there and we've
been able to show.

Turning to the right side of Slide 5, you see further description of those 10 related assets that Chris noted at the outset where we enjoyed a great
deal of success. It was across 18 different cases. We did speak about this in a prior call and included in our prior disclosures that we had made a
concentrated debt on an asset where we had a great -- we had very high conviction, and we're very pleased that, that has resolved favorably in a
complete win and that has generated $423 million of realizations group-wide, of which $279 million is realized gain. For the balance sheet, that's
$266 million of realizations, $172 million of which is gain. And mind you, the balance sheet numbers don't take into account that on the additional
$100 million plus that the funds would have earned, the balance sheet and you, our investors, would earn performance fees, which is a positive.

And I think it's important to see this as yet another example of what we've been saying for some time that outsized returns are not a one-off in this
business, they are part and parcel of the business model that when we take matters into our portfolio and we have a diverse array of matters, we

                                                                                                                                                                             
 don't know whether any particular matter is going to be the one that settles early, delivers a decent return, we can recycle that capital and move
on or whether it's going to go the distance in which case, if it wins, it could mean a much, much larger return, a home run or it could mean in a
smaller number of cases, a loss. All we know is that when we take these matters into our portfolio, we negotiate deals and price them in such a way
that the returns are going to be attractive for early settlements, and we are going to share in truly outsized returns for the matters that go the
distance.

And so when we have a matter that generates high returns. Chris mentioned before, just the number of resolutions we've had that have generated
returns on invested capital of greater than 200%. That's not a one-off. It's not like the diamond in the rough. It's not that we happen to have found
a particular opportunity and will we be able to find it again. That's not at all the way it works. The way -- that is just part and parcel of our portfolio.
When we underwrite a matter and price it and negotiate the deal and decide to include it in our portfolio and put capital out, we go through all
the possible permutations. We model out all the things that can happen in the case, ranging from the very high-end recovery to the complete loss
to the settlements in between. And we know that is -- that the high-end returns are one of the possible scenarios, and we have enough matters in
our portfolio that some number of them historically have traditionally generated those kinds of returns. So we're very pleased with this. It's just
yet another example of that fact about our business model.

Turning to Slide 6, I'll kind of finish with the question I started with, which is as you've grown and you've delivered greater returns on an absolute
basis. You see on the right slide that we're up over $1.5 billion of realizations from our capital provision direct portfolio alone, are you able to
maintain the return levels that you were able to achieve in earlier periods when you had a smaller portfolio. And you see on the left slide, the answer
is yes, we are. That, in fact, the IRR ticked up slightly to 32%, but we've had consistent IRRs throughout our history and the return on invested capital,
in fact, have gone up to 97%.

So as Chris said, we're just really pleased to be able to report these results. I have had confidence in the portfolio throughout and -- but I'm very
glad to be able to show you what I've long known. And just a note, I mentioned on that 2 slides ago that 2019, those investments we put on in
2019 have contributed significantly to our realized gain in 2020. And just think about that. 2019 was a year when to the outside world, Burford
appeared perhaps like it was under siege. There were people that were questioning Burford's business model and potential. Meanwhile, our team
was very hard at work. We maintained our relationships with law firms and corporate clients. We continue to put on deals. We can maintain rigorous
underwriting. We put out lots of money and didn't let the public noise distract us. And there's some irony that during a period when outsiders were
questioning whether Burford was doing well, we internally at Burford were working hard. And now you, in 2020, whether you're a long-term holder
who held stock and maintained faith or you're new to it, I'm really pleased that you've been able to benefit now from the hard work we put in last
year.

And so I'm just really pleased with the results. And with that, I will turn it back to Chris.

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
Thanks very much, Jon. I'm going to speak to Slide 7 and 8, but I'm going to do that quite quickly because Jon has largely stolen my thunder. But
I think the point to be made here, and you've seen these slides before and they just are our effort graphically to illustrate to you what Jon and I
have both been saying orally. The litigation and the way that we construct our litigation portfolio has a rhythm to it and the set of reasonably
predictable outcomes. And so if you look at Slide 7, what you see there are those 3 possible outcomes. We make investments. The capital is deployed
and the cases go on and they either win or lose or settle. And those are the only 3 outcomes.

Litigation comes to an end. It's not something that is open-ended. And the process drives it along. And I think what's notable there is that 90% of
the time, 90% of the dollars that we're putting out are generating high positive returns, either because they're settling fairly rapidly and generating
nice IRRs as a result and nice but lower returns on capital or they're going to trial or some other form of adjudication and winning, which obviously
takes longer but generates much higher nominal returns. And 10% of the time, we lose, and that's the nature of the business model. And frankly
that is why our returns are high, because there aren't very many capital provision businesses out there, where every single investment you make
a complete loss of all of your capital is just not only possible, but part of the expected outcome of some portion of your book.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so the pricing for our capital is appropriately high to reflect that risk. And I think people in the legal market understand and appreciate that.
Our pricing and these returns are not inconsistent with the historical returns of lawyers who have taken risk in cases. So it's not as though we're
doing something that is outside the norm. What we're doing is we're doing it in a repeatable process at scale with professional investment
management.

And so if you turn then to Slide 8, what that shows you is that when we do lose, we lose very asymmetrically. So our losses are small compared to
the wins that are big. And if you look at the right side of this graph that not only shows you all of the big wins, but if you look at the green shading,
those are just the 2020 big wins. So again, to sort of underline the point, this is the way this business works. We will consistently have, in our view,
the spread of outcomes over time, settlements in the middle, losses to the left and larger wins to the right.

Now what makes this business somewhat difficult, and we've said this before, from a public market perspective is that we are buy-and-hold investors.
We're dependent on the operation of the litigation process. This -- which does not organize itself neatly for quarterly or semiannual reporting to
shareholders. Judges decide things when judges decide things. And we will clearly continue to have terrific period like we had in the first half of
this year. And we will also continue to have periods where much less happens. On an individual or even a portfolio-wide basis, we are not yet at
the stage of being able to have a smooth, predictable outcome as to either timing or merits results. But frankly, that's why we get paid the returns
that we get paid. If this business were easy and predictable and smooth, then banks would do it. You wouldn't be generating these kind of returns
and you wouldn't need Burford.

So turning to Slide 9. Let's talk a little bit about COVID. And I think the thing to start with, with respect to our business and litigation is to remember
that we are not a business like a hotel or a restaurant or an airline, where a day without new business means that business has gone forever. A
restaurant that doesn't sell a meal tonight doesn't get to sell twice as many tomorrow. But that's not true in our business. Litigation, as I've just
been belaboring, is not an immediate and speedy process. And that's true around its commencement as well as around its progression once
commenced.

And so what that means is that if you have a disruption to the system, as we've certainly had this year, that doesn't cause litigation that wasn't
brought to go away, it simply causes it to be brought later. It is very rare for us to see a case that comes to us and that has to be filed immediately
or it will become untimely. In many instances, you've got 6 years to sue over things. There's no rush. And as investors, we would sometimes wish
there was a little bit more rush in the court and litigation process, but the reality is that they're just -- and so what we saw earlier this year was in
the first spike of the pandemic sort of March, April and May, we really saw a significant freeze in activity in the legal system generally.

Courts gave into delay in many cases, not always. We had certainly activity in cases, but there were certainly no trials and lots of cases didn't move
forward as rapidly as they otherwise would have. Lawyers had to adjust to a new way of working. And frankly, if you're a lawyer and all of a sudden,
you're setting up your office in your living room and trying to manage a bunch of cases remotely, seeking litigation finance for a brand-new case
that doesn't need to be brought yet is not going to be the top thing on your mind. And so we saw a sharp fall in new business written, and we saw
a full deployment on existing matters that was less severe because some of those cases were continuing on, but we certainly saw that number fall
because there were also cases that simply didn't do very much. And as a result, our capital didn't go out.

This is not a bad thing from our perspective. We actually often make more money when things go more slowly. It can be aggravating, but it doesn't
necessarily hurt our returns. It often enhances them when we have time-based multiples involved in our investment matters. And as a new business,
I think our view is that when the world normalizes, you will see a return to our historical patterns. When that happens, I think is a matter of some
conjecture. If you'd asked me 6 weeks ago what I thought about the second half of 2020, I would have given you a pretty optimistic answer because
at that point, it felt to me just from the sort of fabric of the legal world as the things were coming back. It felt like kids were going back to school.
It felt like courts were figuring out how to reopen and conduct trials and it felt like lawyers were going back to their offices.

Now with a resurgence in COVID cases, that picture is less clear to me and I think you will continue to see litigation delays this fall. But at the same
time, you'll continue to see progress. We have a case going to trial, I think, in 3 weeks. But at the same time, we're seeing delays in other cases. And
I also think that while we -- while I would expect that new business will return somewhat, it would not surprise me if we continue to have a difficult
fall on the COVID front that we won't have an immediate or sort of a V-shaped rebound in the litigation process. But as I said before, that's deferral
for us. It doesn't mean that, that business isn't going to come. And on top of that, we exist, obviously, in an environment where the events of 2020

                                                                                                                                                                             
 are going to produce a very significant volume of disputes for years and years and years to come. And many of those disputes won't even be started
for years. This is exactly the experience that we had with the financial crisis. We did quite a lot of financial crisis litigation arising out of the events
a decade ago, but we didn't do any in 2009. That litigation came in for years and continued to support the business, and I think that we expect to
see the same thing here.

So certainly, you see these short-term impacts on the business, but I don't think that we regard those as a cause for any sort of concern over the
long term.

So with that, let me turn you to Jim Kilman.

James W. Kilman - Burford Capital Limited - CFO
Thanks, Chris. So turning to Slide 10. Although Chris and Jon have talked about how this was a period where significant realizations and realized
gains drove our results, it's also worth noting that we did have a modest level of unrealized gains during that half as well. As a reminder, we are
required under IFRS to fair value our legal finance assets. For a small number of them, primarily our YPF-related assets, we have historical sales-based
values to factor into our fair value. Since there were no significant sales transactions or other case developments on the YPF-related assets during
the first half, we have not changed our carrying value for them, which remains at $773 million.

As a consequence, none of our unrealized gains during the period were YPF related. Then for the vast majority of our legal finance assets, as we've
talked about, we fair value them based on policy prescribed percentage marks up or down based on case progress, pre-trial rulings, trial outcomes,
appeal wins and the like. To provide some more transparency on these fair value adjustments on the portfolio, we've included a new table in Note
13 of our financial statements that provide some data on how these policy prescribed percentages have actually been applied. So I'd encourage
you to take a look at that.

As Jon touched on, during the first half of 2020, we did have positive progress in a number of cases in our capital provision direct portfolio, as you
would expect, as our portfolio continues to season and mature. This drove $68 million of unrealized gains during the period. Even with those gains,
though, our total unrealized gain on the capital provision direct portfolio setting YPF aside, remains quite modest at only 12% of carrying value.
In our 2019 results, RNS, which we issued on April 28, we reported on some significant favorable portfolio case progress in 2020 so far. We thought
it would be helpful here today to show how some of that progress translated into results during the first half. The table on the bottom right of Slide
10 is designed to do that.

Focusing on the balance sheet only moments for -- amounts for a moment. We said in April that we had final matters that could generate $300
million of ultimate cash receipts and $200 million of income over time. As we emphasized at that time, those are the amounts we expected to
receive in total from those matters over their lives. However, during the first half, much of that actually happened from the matters referenced in
the April RNS, we had $272 million of realizations, some of which were receivables at period end. But all of which are on track to produce cash
receipts, and those realizations produced $173 million of realized gain.

We also said in April that we had earlier-stage matters that we expected to ultimately produce $100 million of income. As you would expect, those
matters are not as far along, so it didn't produce realizations during the first half. But the progress in those cases did drive $42 million of unrealized
gain during the period. So in aggregate, for the balance sheet, the matters we referred to in April generated $272 million of realizations during the
first half and $218 million of income. And to be clear, the cases we referenced in April aren't done yet. We would expect to achieve the remaining
realizations in income from this group of matters over future periods.

Shifting now to focus on cash. On Slide 11, we lay out our cash generation during the first half of 2020. As noted previously, although we had
significant capital provision direct realizations in the first half, many of those were still receivables at period end. So our cash proceeds from that
part of our portfolio in the period were relatively modest at $46 million, but we've been collecting substantially on those receivables as the second
half has progressed. However, despite the pandemic's impact on the market environment, we were able to generate $170 million of proceeds from
our capital provision indirect assets.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We have described these in the past as a medium-term source of liquidity for us and they certainly delivered that in the first half. Our total of $224
million of cash receipts for the first half of 2020 was in line with the same period last year and provided significantly more cash than we needed
for our expenses and even our deployments in the period. Importantly, however, the large amount of capital provision direct realizations during
the first half left us with $281 million of receivables at June 30. Those have begun to turn into cash. And as that continues, it bodes well for our cash
generation during the second half of the year.

To recap our liquidity picture, we turn to Slide 12, where you see we ended the first half with $262 million of cash and cash management assets.
We had $281 million of receivables at June 30 for a total of $543 million of assets that either are cash or would be expected to become cash fairly
soon, which is why we feel quite comfortable about our current liquidity position.

The total of cash and receivables at June 30 was almost twice what we had a year earlier and 73% higher than our highest previous total for a first
half period. And it's worth noting that by September 15 of this year, $86 million of those receivables had turned into cash already, and our cash
and cash management balance stood at over $300 million. It's -- we've built up that liquidity without raising any external capital for the balance
sheet in almost 2 years and without issuing any debt since early 2018, which pretty clearly indicates the cash-generative power of the business.

On the right-hand side of Slide 12, we lay out some highlights of our capital structure. We remain very conservatively levered with a net debt to
tangible assets ratio of 14%, dramatically lower than our covenant level of 50%. Our debt structure continues to be longer-dated than our average
assets. Our debt is laddered with our nearest maturity almost 2 years away and even that could be covered several times over by the level of cash
receipts we've generated in each of the last several years.

Given our liquidity and our rock-solid balance sheet, we feel quite comfortable that Burford is well positioned for both the opportunities and the
challenges that lie ahead.

And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris.

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
Thanks, Jim. And just to wrap up on Slide 13. So as you can tell from that fairly long presentation, we're pretty excited about what has happened
so far this year, and we're also pretty excited about the future. We think that Burford is very well positioned from both a market and a financial
perspective, especially considering our cash liquidity and our access to significant fund capital to be able to capitalize on the opportunities that
we see ahead, and we're thrilled with where things stand right at the moment. So rather than me rattle on any more about our enthusiasm, why
don't we pause and take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes via the webcast from Mike Brooks of Aberdeen Standard Investments. Asking, please, can you
provide an update on YPF? What is the potential timetable and scenarios from here and the relevance, if any, from the Argentina debt restructuring?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
Thanks, Mike. So the YPF cases, both the Petersen and the Eton Park cases, are currently pending in the trial court in the Southern District of New
York. So that's the Federal Court in Manhattan. And as those of you who have followed these cases know, we have won decisively on the question
of jurisdiction for the U.S. Court. So that was the important first half of this case and that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Now having
won that, the cases are in what we would call sort of a normal litigation posture where they're proceeding through discovery right now. And then
after discovery, you'll have a period of motion practice followed ultimately by a trial.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 The court has set a schedule for those cases to move along quite rapidly, and they are moving along as we speak. This is litigation, so there will
doubtlessly be twists and turns along the way. But right now, they're behaving like a normal piece of large dollar contracts litigation, which is
exactly what this case is. The -- as we've long explained that the litigation judgment, the litigation debt is entirely unrelated to the sovereign debt
picture, which is a contractual set of agreements between lenders and our country. There is obviously no such contractual agreement in litigation
and arbitration. And so the 2 processes, the 2 systems operate entirely independently. And so the debt restructuring doesn't have any impact one
way or the other on these claims, just as the default prior to the restructuring didn't have any effect and wouldn't cause us any particular anxiety.

Operator
We have another question from Laurence Endersen of Capstrive, asking congratulations on your progress. Have you seen any major changes in
the competitive environment for litigation finances? Is your leadership position widening?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So it's an interesting question when you look across the market because certainly, there's more capital than there ever has been going into the
legal finance market. If you went back some years, much of that capital was coming from small venture capital like players. Some of those players
have grown and some of them have struggled and left the market. And you've seen also attempts of new entry that have been somewhat constrained
this year by the pandemic and by liquidity dynamics for their backers. So Burford certainly considers itself to have a very robust market position in
the market, and we don't think that has changed. But it's -- there's also no question that we will continue to see entry into this market and from
our perspective, that's a very good thing. And we've always taken that position.

The reason we think entry is good is because the potential users of litigation finance capital are incredibly diffuse. They basically include every law
firm and every company that has claims out there in the world. And for it to be a normal and accepted part of your corporate finance practice to
make use of this capital, just like in any other area of corporate finance, there needs to be a robust market. If Burford were the only player, a
monopolist player in this marketplace, it would not be nearly as large. And so what we have long done is actually welcomed entry and the most
recent example of our industry leadership is that just a month or so ago, we announced the formation of the International Legal Finance Association,
the very first trade association for this industry, where we've taken form of a leadership role. And things like that, we think just cement our position
in the market, but also normalize the use of this capital broadly in the sector and we think that's a positive for us.

Operator
Our next question comes via the phone lines from Julian Roberts of Jefferies.

Julian Roberts - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Associate
A couple for me, if it's all right. The first one is, are you able to give us any idea of the creditworthiness of the defendant in the cases behind the
newly recognized receivable? And any further expectations around the timing of receipts? I know you've already commented on that. And then
the second one, selfishly to try to help analysts, is there anything we could monitor, which might give us an idea of the sort of resurgence of litigation
funding opportunities for you? Or will we basically just have to wait for the next results? Is there any other indicator we could look at?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So in terms of creditworthiness of the defendant in the related cases, we have been publishing for a little while now our concentration tables where
we talk about the industries that our large cases are involved in, and those related cases were involved in the insurance industry. And I think that
it's fair to say that there is -- that we have no concerns about creditworthiness at all in terms of the payers of the judgments there.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In terms of timing, this is really just a mechanical question. So we've said that these are a group of related cases and so what that basically means
is that each of the cases is a separate litigation matter pending in its own court. And so what happens after the comprehensive win that we have
here is each court has to deal with its own processes, and some of them are faster than others. But there's nothing substantive that stands in
between these cases paying and today. So the question is just one of mechanics and it's the speed at which each court process goes through and
stamps the various papers and all of the other administrative steps that need to happen. And that's why when we have these receivables after
cases resolved, the vast majority of them pay within 6 months. And indeed, you probably would have seen more of these paid by now if it weren't
for the fact that these cases resolved really very late in the first half. So I don't have a precise prediction about timing, but this isn't -- it's not as
though there are multiple stages more of litigation to go here.

In terms of how to sort of externally monitor the market, I think, unfortunately, there really isn't, is the simple fact of the matter. There's not --
litigation is a pretty local activity and it's sufficiently diffuse as well in terms of scale. So even if you were to log on to the U.S. Court system and
watch new filings, in a particular court that -- even that wouldn't help you particularly because a lot of those filings are going to be in cases that
wouldn't be attractive to us as a financing matter. And so you'd have to really dig in and do a lot of research to figure out, gee, I'm seeing now a
resurgence in large dollar antitrust cases in the United States, for example, that would be pretty difficult to track on any sort of basis. So I wish I
could help you more with that, but I really don't see it unfortunately.

Our next question comes from James Hamilton of Numis.

James William Lawrence Hamilton - Numis Securities Limited, Research Division - Analyst
There are 2 areas I'd like you to try to help with, if you can, please. Firstly, obviously, whilst the pandemic is terrible, my observation is there's been
an enormous amount of economic disruption. I was just wondering, in terms of quantum, how do you sort of view this versus the disruption that
you saw in the global financial crisis? And what specifically thinking about here is breach of contract, where company A has said, I want X by Y date
and for a whole variety of reasons that hasn't materialized? It would be the first.

The sort of second is if there is a huge volume of litigation finance questions, volumes, would you see the mix out of things like complex strategies
where you have a lot of flexibility that you mentioned? And therefore, over the next few years, the mix of the portfolio might shift?

And finally, without wanting to be too greedy, I was just wondering if you could -- I appreciate that there are a huge number of cases settled. But
assuming that your cases don't settle and they all went to trial, I'm just sort of wondering what sort of proportion of your caseload could deliver
what I would describe as an exceptional result, such as the one you've posted today?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So let me start, and then I'm going to ask Jon also to sort of chime in on these. The -- when you talk about litigation arising from a pandemic, I really
think you're talking about 2 things there, not just one. One is claims that are actually caused by the pandemic and, James, for example, you referenced
breach of contract claims, so certainly, you're going to see lots of litigation that is effectively fault or loss allocation litigation. And I'm sure we'll see
some of that. That's obviously much more widespread than it was in the financial crisis because everybody has been affected in some way or other
by the pandemic, whereas very much fewer -- there are many people in the global financial crisis actually had a cause of action arising out of
something that went awry.

But I think Jon will have some further thoughts on that. Before I turn it over to Jon and Jon will also talk about these other -- your other 2 questions
as well, I would just comment briefly on mix and complex strategies and so on. And I think the answer there is 2 parts. One is we're obviously very
opportunistic. And so if we see a gold rush of opportunities in core litigation finance that we really like, we'll obviously allocate capital there in
preference to some of the other opportunities that we might see in adjacencies.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The other thing going on, though, is the complex strategies business, as we've been practicing, it thus far really relies on a -- not only a robust M&A
market, but a robust M&A market with fairly high prices and not so much stress. And so I think that leaving allocation aside, you're likely to see low
volumes from us in that strategy for the near term, at least, until we see a return to more robust M&A. I didn't talk about this when I was talking
about COVID numbers, but one of the other factors in COVID numbers, of course, for us is, we're also very sensitive to market conditions. So we
were -- in addition to the legal industry closing down, we were also cautious about both creditworthiness and desirability of matters, which caused
us to slow our own pipeline somewhat, and that's true in complex strategies as well. We're not going to chase an opportunity that we think is
potentially unrewarding just for the sake of doing the business. Jon?

Jonathan T. Molot - Burford Capital Limited - CIO
Sure. So those are great questions. And to the first one in terms of the mix of litigation and volume and the third and what the return profile would
be, I would say, sort of following up on Chris' theme that the financial crisis created litigation in 2 ways: one, very specific, right? The particularly
residential mortgage-backed securities that collapsed, there were holders of those that had claims. So if you were an investor in a financial instrument
and you were a victim of fraud, you had a claim and that led to a lot of specific litigation. But there was a -- and I suppose you'd say the comparable
category of litigation today would be where there's COVID-related interruption of business or triggering the breach of a contract and there could
be litigation over who bears the risk, as Chris said.

But then there was a second respect in which the financial crisis led to litigation finance opportunities that I think is the same today as it would
have been then and perhaps even broader, as Chris said, because of the greater magnitude of the disruption globally. And that is people don't
tend to sue each other when deals go well, they sue each other when things go badly. If both parties to a contract make money, they're not litigation.
It's only when they don't make money that they're litigating over who has to bear that risk. And when things go badly, not only are there therefore
more litigation claims in the aftermath, but companies lack the capital to finance those claims, right? They are busy with whatever their legal
budgets are and they are hiring lawyers to deal with corporate matters, defensive matters, regulatory matters, they don't have the budget for the
extra litigation. And we've long talked about how as an accounting matter affirmative litigation doesn't pay, and the CFO won't want to increase
the budget for it because it reduces earnings, it increases expenses, reduces earnings. And if you trade at a multiple times earnings, it further
depresses your valuation.

So you've got companies who have more claims, they don't have the money to finance them. And then you have law firms who are going to see
a slowdown in their corporate work in their routine matters. And therefore, they are looking for alternative sources of business and revenue to
keep their lawyers busy and they need cash. So those 2 things together mean that law firms are out there trying to win more of the business that
corporations don't want to pay by the hour for and there's more litigation. And that's what we found in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And I
think it's beginning to appear now. We're seeing glimmers of it. But as Chris said, the initiation of litigation is not an immediate thing, it's something
that happens over time. But we are clearly seeing companies that would not have come to us for litigation finance before, they wouldn't have
thought of us as a source of finance, but they are sitting with claims that may be pandemic related or may not be directly related to the pandemic
and they're coming to us for finance because the economic fallout from COVID has hurt their balance sheet, hurt their income statement and they
need the money.

On the question of returns, your third question, how much will they resemble the returns from this particular set of matters? In fact, it's always
going to be the case. The returns on invested capital and the IRRs we've enjoyed from those 10 related investments, when we model out any new
pretrial matter, we're taking pre-litigation matter at the outset, we're going to look for that level of return where the matter is something that would
go all the way to trial. So as I said sort of earlier on, there's going to be a spectrum of possibilities.

If those matters settle early, then we would earn lower returns on invested capital but might have comparable IRRs, where they run longer, we'd
expect much higher ones. And you make the point that actually, if you're someone who thinks I'm more interested in absolute returns, it is the case
that in downturns, settlements may take longer. People may drag things out because they want to postpone the payment, and that can lead to,
in fact, higher absolute returns in the long run. But that's all -- again, we're building a portfolio, I can't predict with precision how any particular
matter in the portfolio will perform. All I can say is that's been our experience in the past that within the portfolio, there are going to be matters
that will produce those kinds of outsized returns, that's what's happened.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Operator
Our next question comes via the webcast from Peter Webster of Janus Henderson, asking given the likelihood of dispute inflation linked to pandemic
disruption, are you looking to raise more external capital to fund growth?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So I think we are in the same position we have been in for years with respect to our capital structure and access to capital, which is that by having
a multiplicity of capital sources, we are comfortable that we're never in a position of being forced capital raisers, and that instead lets us be
opportunistic. So in addition to the balance sheet, which obviously has today a very significant amount of cash on it and also a significant amount
of debt capacity, we also, of course, have our private funds business, where we have hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental dry powder
available to us and quite likely, the ability to access more capital there should we need it. So it's not something -- it's not as though we view it as a
binary issue, we just watch market conditions and act appropriately. But as Jim said during his presentation, we've done what we've done without
having to raise any external capital at all for the last couple of years. And so we certainly don't feel any compulsion to do that either.

Operator
Next question comes from Andrew Shepherd-Barron of Peel Hunt.

Andrew Shepherd-Barron - Peel Hunt LLP, Research Division - Analyst
Okay, yes. Two related questions from me, if I may. On the cash, if you look at the narrowest definition of cash received in the first half and it's
basically capital provision direct, $46 million. Obviously, you've got some short-term receivables relating to that. If all of those come in, in the second
half, on that narrowest definition, how much would that then total in terms of cash this year?

And second question is that given what you said about the latest proceedings, et cetera, if it takes time to collect cash, is it unlikely, I'm sure it's not
impossible, but is it unlikely that we would see further significant cash coming in on capital provision direct cases in the second half?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So I'm going to turn the first question over to Jim Kilman. As to the second question, I think the simple answer is that we don't know. We don't
know in this period and we don't know in any period. We are -- in most cases, there's a pretty short advanced period where we know or think that
there might be cash coming from a case, there might be a case resolving. And it's just extremely difficult to predict because we're in the hands of
both of when judges decide and also when corporate litigants choose to settle. The fourth quarter of every calendar year, historically, this is not
even with relation to Burford, historically, is a period of active litigation settlement because I used to do this in my prior job when I was the General
Counsel of Time Warner, you sort of get to the end of the year and you go dicker with the CFO about how much free cash he had and you'd make
some settlement offers to resolve litigation that otherwise you thought next year, we're likely to go and do something and you try to take advantage
of getting out early.

And I think we simply don't know in the fall of 2020 what that's going to look like for corporate defendant. So I think it's a wholly unpredictable
outcome at this moment. But once again, other than the fact that we're a public company and public investors like to see growth and predictability,
frankly, from the businesses perspective, from a purely cash perspective, something that we're indifferent to. We tend to make more money when
matters take longer. And so while we're happy for things to settle and go off risk and produce cash, we're also perfectly happy for them to stay
outstanding and for our return multiples to keep on growing.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Indeed, there are moments in the business where we're sort of crossing our fingers and hoping something doesn't resolve at a particular point in
time because if it doesn't, then it goes on and it trips another multiple increment. So there is a tension between the market's desire for smoothness
and predictability and the way to maximize cash earnings in this business.

Jim, do you want to take the first one?

James W. Kilman - Burford Capital Limited - CFO
Sure. Andrew, as I think I understand your question, if you take the $46 million in cash that we got from the capital provision direct segment in the
first half. And I think it is fair to assume that virtually all of the receivables relate to our capital provision direct assets, the capital provision, indirect
realizations tend to turn into cash very quickly. So if you do assume that all $281 million of receivables come in, in the -- and you kind of add those
back to the $46 million, then you would get, I believe, $327 million that effectively is the cash number, if all of the receivables had paid in the current
period. You could also, I suppose, take a look at it and say, the net increase in receivables during the period was $262 million, in which case the
equivalent number would be $308 million.

Operator
Our next question comes from Portia Patel of Canaccord.

Portia Anjuli Patel - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst
I've got 2, please, on capital provision indirect. So the first one is just turning to cash again. So of the $224 million cash receipts you've flagged,
capital provision indirect accounted for $170 million of those, but its P&L contribution in terms of the realized gains relative to cost seems to be
just $3 million. So therefore, should we conclude that the return on the $170 million of invested capital for complex strategies is very low single
digit?

And secondly, given that the portfolio on balance sheet of complex strategies now stands at $46 million, down from $183 million in December,
and clearly, as you've explained, it's been an important source of cash for you in this half and in recent periods. I'd just be interested to know what
your expectation of cash to come back from those outstanding complex strategies investments are and in what time frame?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
Sure. So in your first question, you're right, we took a conscious decision in light of economic conditions during the course of 2020 to push to
resolve some of those matters, and we were willing to do so at a discount to their usual historical returns in exchange for getting the capital in
rapidly. And that resolved, in our minds, any concerns in the cases that resolved with our creditworthiness and so on. So that was a conscious
decision, but that's correct. As to the remaining assets, when you say it's been an important set of cash for us, I'd probably not agree with that,
frankly. What it's been is a place where we have been able to deploy cash with a more predictable, more reliable pace of getting that cash back
again at moderate returns, returns that are much less significant than our litigation finance returns, but better, frankly, than just keeping the cash
in the bank.

And so it's been a -- we are -- we've always been in complete control about how much cash we want to put into that strategy. And again, as you
can see, we have the ability to get the cash back out of it pretty expeditiously if that's our choice to do so.

So at any given time, we're obviously cash-rich right now, and we're comfortable with the positions in the remaining assets. So it's not something
that we feel any need to race to do, we'll just be opportunistic about getting that cash back in from the investments at the appropriate point.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Operator
Our next question comes via the webcast from John Dalton, asking the retail bonds continue to trade at elevated yield levels. Has there been any
thought given to bond buyback or refinancing?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So I agree with you. I think the pricing on the bonds is nuts and I actually think they're an extraordinarily good deal right now. I also find the pricing
on the screen to not necessarily be reflective of the pricing in the market, and I say this from personal experience because Jon and I actually bought
some of the bonds a while ago and we were consistently unable to lay our hands on them for the prices that the screens suggest they trade at. So
I think that's a murky world out there.

But as we said in the -- in our liquidity discussion in the interim report, this is an area where we're prepared to be entirely opportunistic with respect
to our debt capital in both directions. So we're prepared to be opportunistic repurchasers, especially in view of the fact that there's a maturity in a
couple of years for one of those bond series, and we're also prepared to be opportunistic issuers, again, depending on market conditions.

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
And I enjoy talking so much that I realize that we have gone now for well over an hour. So if there's one more question, I'm happy to take it. But
otherwise, we can certainly call this to a close and not burden you further today.

Operator
Our final question comes from [David Jones].

Unidentified Analyst
What I wanted to ask you, please, is, at which stage would you think that Burford would sort of move from continually expanding balance sheet
and so you're using all the cash it gets to invest in more cases? And at what point would you consider producing larger distribution for shareholders?

Christopher P. Bogart - Burford Capital Limited - CEO & Director
So thanks. That's a great question. And I think our answer to that really boils down to the quality of opportunity that we see. We've built now over
the past 11 years, the market-leading business with a great market presence in an expanding field. And given the effort and cost that has gone
into building that position and the fact that as we've demonstrated and as Jon has taken you through in detail, we're still able to generate very
high returns on capital when we deploy it. It seems a little bit foolish not to take advantage of that market position and continue to grow and
continue to deploy capital to the extent that we believe we can continue to make attractive returns on it.

So the market is still at that stage. And I think we still have the mindset of continuing to take advantage of what we've built and continuing to drive
returns for shareholders. But we're certainly sensitive to all of the shareholder dynamics in play here.

And with that, I think given that we're almost at a quarter past the hour, I think Jon and Jim and I and the entire rest of the Burford team would like
to thank all of you very much, not only for participating in this call today and hearing us out, but also for your support over the last year or so,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 especially given that it has been a more tumultuous period for various reasons in the global economy and more locally to Burford. And we hope
that the combination of these results and our explanation of the business and the U.S. listing that you're about to see come into fruition provides
people with a strong degree of comfort about what this business is and what it's capable of delivering and we look forward to continuing to speak
with you about the business in the months and years ahead. Thank you all very much for participating.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Janet, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to share our results with you today.

We believe this was a pivotal quarter for our organization with strong sales and profit growth as well as enhanced financial strength through high
cash flow generation within the quarter of $750 million coupled with effective expense and debt management.

We achieved strong top line growth and delivered second quarter comparable sales of 6%, the first positive quarterly comp since the fourth quarter
of 2016. Additionally, we delivered improvement in gross margin even with the increased strength of our digital business. Our strong results flowed
through to the bottom line with adjusted EPS of $0.50, the strongest adjusted quarterly earnings reported in over 2 years.

While we will detail our overall second quarter performance today, we are most excited to share how this quarter serves as a runway to our 3-year
plan that we will share at our virtual Investor Day on October 28.

During our call today, Gustavo Arnal, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, will review our second quarter financial results. Then, Cindy Davis, Chief
Brand Officer and President, Decorist, will speak about the quarter from a commercial and customer perspective. And then John Hartmann, Chief
Operating Officer and President, buybuy BABY, will do the same for our operations. We will then take questions.

As we've said before, we are confident in our financial position and our ability to manage through these very uncertain times. We've taken further
action to build a strong financial base, including reducing our cost structure, enhancing our financial flexibility and investing where it matters most
to our customers, as we strengthen our authority in the home space.

As you'll hear from Gustavo, we remain focused on ensuring liquidity and optimizing costs, including actions to improve cash flow generation.
With such a strong cash and investments balance now of $1.5 billion plus our ABL, we have approximately 2x more liquidity than debt outstanding
on our balance sheet.

We also drove significant improvement in several other key performance metrics, including adjusted gross margin, which increased 200 basis
points year-over-year. With a sharpened focus on driving a better curation of product mix and curated data-driven management of markdowns
and promotions, including coupons, we delivered significant adjusted gross margin expansion while also driving continued strong comp growth
in our digital channels of 89%.

We've also seen these actions and trends continue throughout the month of September.

By the end of the second quarter, our digital sales represented approximately 32% of total sales, benefiting from our enhanced omnichannel
capabilities, including Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and Curbside Pickup, which now represent over 15% of total digital sales and growing. Together
with our ship-from-store capability, our stores have filled approximately 36% of our total digital orders in the second quarter. These expanded
fulfillment capabilities are favorably impacting our gross margin and will continue to further enhance the overall profitability of our digital business.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 During this unprecedented time when our homes have become the center of our lives, we are well placed as customers spend more in their home
and lifestyle. We see this trend continuing, and we've been responding with agility to the changing needs of our customers, both in terms of our
merchandise and service offerings.

We are delighted by the continued strong response to our new BOPIS and curbside services this quarter and the recent launch of our new Same
Day Delivery service this week, making it even easier to shop with us. These new services are contributing to customer growth as we gained
approximately 2 million new online customers in the quarter, including approximately 800,000 who are completely new to Bed Bath & Beyond.
These new customers are purchasing from our core higher-margin product categories, including bedding, bath, kitchen food prep and cleaning
and home maintenance.

From a merchandising perspective, we are pleased with our performance during this very different back-to-college season, which has actually
fortified our authority in this important life stage. As you've heard me say before, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we planned to lean heavily into
the back-to-college moment to showcase our new brand strategy and elements of our enhanced customer value proposition. In the wake of the
pandemic, we quickly mobilized and were able to adapt our plans to the changing market conditions while at the same time staying true to the
spirit and intent of our college campaign. We had a highly successful back-to-college season, achieving sales growth of 21% compared to last year.
Cindy will provide some more details on this in a few moments.

In addition to our commercial success this quarter, we also strengthened our operations, investing in and improving core proficiencies essential
to rebuilding the foundations of our business. Our diverse senior leadership team of highly experienced retail experts is now in place, and we're
pleased to be joined by several new next-level leaders to accelerate the transformation even further. John will talk more about this as well as the
operational investments we are making in areas such as technology to further power our growth.

As we focus our efforts to optimize growth opportunities within home, baby, beauty and wellness, we remain highly committed to reviewing our
noncore assets. We completed the sale of PersonalizationMall.com in early August with net proceeds of approximately $245 million, and we continue
to believe there is significant value that could be unlocked through further asset sales, which we're continuing to review.

In framing our second quarter results against the backdrop of an abnormal first quarter, we have built a strong financial base and developed a
blueprint for delivering long-term success. Our transformation journey has begun, and the early seeds of our growth strategy are unlocking improved
financial performance.

I will now turn the call over to Gustavo to review our second quarter results in detail. Gustavo?

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

Our second quarter performance showed solid comparable sales growth as well as strong gross margin expansion and EBITDA increase. At the
same time, we unlocked significant cash flow generation. And with this, we strengthened our balance sheet and our financial flexibility with even
greater liquidity and a meaningful reduction in gross debt.

During this quarter, we generated more than $750 million in cash, including over $500 million from operational earnings and working capital
improvements, net of capital investment, and coupled with approximately $245 million in proceeds from the sale of PMall. We capitalized on this
strong cash flow generation by purchasing approximately $300 million in principal value of our bonds at a significant discount and also by paying
down a bank loan of $236 million.

With these actions, we reduced our gross debt by over $500 million or 30% from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter to $1.2 billion at the end
of this quarter. Importantly, we had a pivotal point in our financial position by moving from a net debt position of over $500 million at the end of
the first quarter to a net cash surplus position of $300 million at the end of the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and
investments, well above our debt.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Further, as shared during our first quarter earnings call, we secured an asset-backed lending facility in June. Together with our cash balance, our
liquidity has strengthened to $2.2 billion, which is approximately 2x higher than our bonds outstanding.

Turning now to our sales results. Total comparable sales grew 6%, benefiting from a significant increase in digital comp sales, which were up 89%.

For some context, sales from our digital channels represented about 1/3 of total sales this quarter.

Our strong digital sales performance has been driven by further expansion of our BOPIS and Curbside Pickup services. BOPIS-generated sales
represented 15% of total digital sales in the quarter, tripling its penetration from the last quarter when the service was first introduced.

Net sales in the quarter were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 1% versus last year, partially due to the divestiture of One Kings Lane.

In looking at the monthly progression of sales, recall that we began our phased approach to store reopenings from May through June. And by early
July, virtually all stores were opened. Encouragingly, we delivered positive comparable sales in each month of the quarter. Digital comp growth
was consistently above 80%, which offset the sales declines in stores. Starting in June, our comparable sales were positive, and reported net sales
were down 7%. In July, comp sales were also positive with reported net sales growth of 2%. In August, comp sales were again positive with reported
net sales growth of 1% despite the impact from divestitures during the quarter. Importantly, monthly sales for September and on a preliminary
basis also show positive comparable sales growth with similar store and digital sales as in the second quarter and accelerated BOPIS trends.

I'll now continue to review our second quarter financial results. On a GAAP basis, we reported net earnings per diluted share of $1.75 compared to
a net loss per diluted share of $1.12 in the prior year period. Our GAAP reported net earnings include favorable impacts of approximately $230
million pretax, which are excluded from adjusted results. This includes gains from 2 special items: a $190 million gain on the sale of
PersonalizationMall.com and a $77 million gain on the extinguishment of debt from the bond tender. These gains were partially offset by other
special items with a net unfavorable impact of approximately $37 million, including noncash charges mostly related to impairments of tradenames
and certain store-level assets as well as restructuring and transformation initiative costs.

On an adjusted basis, our net earnings per diluted share were $0.50, an increase of 47% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.34
last year.

Consistent with our prior disclosures, the following references to our quarterly results will be on a non-GAAP basis to better represent year-on-year
performance of the business.

Moving to gross margin. Our gross margin increased 200 basis points to 35.9%. This was driven by approximately 150 basis points of favorable
product mix, including lower coupon expense and optimization of promotion and markdowns, coupled with distribution and fulfillment cost
leverage of 190 basis points. As expected, these benefits were partially offset by the impact of channel mix of 135 basis points from the larger
proportion of total sales from digital channels. Our company's management team will remain focused on gross margin and ensuring we have a
healthy gross margin progression over time.

We said last quarter that gross margin was abnormally low due to the significant impact from store closures. Our second quarter gross margin
shows a return to a more representative base and reflects the benefit of our efforts to unlock our potential growth by optimizing product margin
with an increased proportion of digital sales.

Moving to SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 31.5%, a decline of approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year period. This
was behind a decrease in payroll, advertising and payroll-related expenses, partially offset by an increase in professional fees to support the
company's transformation.

Considering the unprecedented impact from COVID-19, we have taken decisive steps to reduce costs, further simplify our operations and support
our teams to emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position. In August, we implemented our organizational realignment, which included
a workforce reduction of approximately 2,800 roles as part of our previously announced restructuring plan. This action is estimated to generate

                                                                                                                                                                             
 future annual pretax savings of approximately $150 million, which is at the upper end of our initially stated range of $100 million to $150 million
in annual SG&A savings.

And as you'll hear from John in a few minutes, the next phase of our restructuring plan includes a store optimization project, which is already
underway.

Our solid top line performance, coupled with EBITDA margin expansion, drove significant EBITDA growth of 36%. This pivotal improvement shows
that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern, durable business model have already begun.

Turning now to some balance sheet and cash flow statement items. We continue to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending
inventories of $2 billion. On a sequential basis, inventories were lower by approximately $200 million or more than 8% compared to the end of the
first quarter.

Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $37 million with 60% of the expense related to technology projects to improve our omnichannel
capabilities. These include inventory and warehouse management capabilities such as advanced allocation logic and replenishment strategies to
improve customer experience. We do expect to ramp up our CapEx spending from these current levels in subsequent years in support of our
digital-first omni-always transformation. We will share perspective on our future capital allocation plan at our Investor Day later this month.

While our share repurchase and quarterly dividends remain suspended, we remain committed to return capital and expect to share our perspective
during Investors Day.

In summary, our second quarter performance demonstrates our financial agility and discipline as we transform our business. We clearly see a
pathway and expect to deliver significant EBITDA growth and value creation. We will share our multiyear financial road map at our upcoming
Investor Day on the 28th along with the transformation and strategic growth initiatives already underway.

I will now turn the call over to Cindy Davis, our Chief Brand Officer and President of Decorist. Cindy?

Cindy H. Davis - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, Chief Brand Officer & President of Decorist LLC
Thank you, Gustavo.

In second quarter, we delivered a plan that was both inspired by and inspiring to existing and new customers alike. We created and communicated
compelling value and made it easy with our omni-always approach. By sharpening our focus on the key drivers of gross margin, product mix, pricing
and promotion and channel mix, we were able to deliver growth in both comp sales and margin with the potential to unlock significant expansion
going forward.

Digitally, we saw exciting growth in the second quarter with more than 180 million visits to our sites, representing a 52% increase over last year.

In addition, we grew our online conversion to 4%, an increase of 33% versus the prior year period.

Our new mobile app was launched 20 million times during the quarter, which contributed to a 133% increase in demand from our mobile channel.

From a customer standpoint, we gained approximately 2 million new online customers this quarter, and 42% of these customers were new to our
brand. These new customers are enhancing our overall customer profile as they are 6 years younger on average than our existing customers and
less likely to use coupons.

In addition, over 1 million of our in-store shoppers became omnichannel customers, shopping online with us for the first time this quarter.
Omnichannel customers are highly engaged, shopping with us 3x more often and spending 2x more per year than single-channel customers.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Customer response to our new BOPIS and contactless Curbside Pickup services has been strong, generating over $120 million in sales during the
quarter and earning us a 5-star rating on over 80% of these orders. BOPIS and curbside are great solutions for our customers and benefit us financially
with respect to gross margin since BOPIS eliminates the shipping expense usually associated with a digital order. This is key since our digital
penetration grew to approximately 32% from approximately 18% in the prior year. But it is what has enabled these results, our customer-inspired,
data-driven, omni-always, fully integrated approach that gives us the most confidence about our ability to sustain this momentum. There is no
better way to illustrate those than by looking at our successful back-to-college campaign, which drove a 21% increase in college product sales May
1 through September 8. We are pleased with these results, especially during what has been a most unusual back-to-college season.

Bed Bath & Beyond has long been known as a destination for college. And this year, we developed an even stronger plan to serve the college
market. We started with insights, monitoring data and customer response, especially reopening plans for major colleges and universities across
the country, and then pivoted our plan as the season unfolded.

Given the uncertainty of the back-to-college season this year, we brought back our College Savings Pass that offers students 20% off their purchases
all the way through September 30. Over 500,000 students signed up for the College Savings Pass this year, driving over 400,000 transactions with
an average basket size 14% larger than other college transactions.

We created an integrated merchandising and marketing plan with better curated assortments, more competitive pricing and strong value
communication, both in-store and online. We modernized storytelling in our marketing and on our site as well as increased targeting to drive
higher levels of engagement. As a result, we doubled our return on ad spend goal from digital media while increasing ad recall, brand lift and
favorability significantly above industry norms. And our 2-hour Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store and contactless Curbside Pickup services were available
for students and parents at their home store or in their college towns, making it easier than ever to shop with us.

From a product perspective, top trending categories in our college assortment this year were: kitchen electrics, up more than 160%; kitchen
housewares, which was up nearly 250%; and drinkware and flatware categories, which were up more than 650%.

Throughout the season, we kept our finger on the pulse of the college market. As many schools announced plans for remote learning, we heard
from both parents and students alike that they were disappointed to miss out on yet another milestone, the transition from high school to college.
Armed with these insights, we launched our College from Home Campaign in August, adding inspiration to the value and ease of our back-to-college
experience. We tapped our online interior design team at Decorist to develop a variety of room designs to help inspire students to create their
own perfect dorm room at home.

Despite the unprecedented COVID impact on our business over the past 6 months, Bed Bath & Beyond remained a key college destination this
year. And according to research we recently conducted, the college season may not be over yet. In fact, the data shows that 32% of students
surveyed said they will be going to campus for the first time in 2021, and they have shopping to do. We will be ready to meet their needs with
inspiration, value and ease.

As we look forward to the important holiday season, this year will be one like no other. We are prepared for customers to shop earlier and have
expanded our omni services with Same Day Delivery, leveraging our store footprint to allow them to shop whenever, wherever and however they
want.

We have robust plans under our house strategic framework and our 5 key pillars to rebuild our authority in the home space. I look forward to
speaking with you again later this month at our Investor Day when we dive deep into each one of these pillars. We are excited about our growth
plans and the positive impact we are already seeing in our results.

With that, I will turn the call over to John Hartmann, our Chief Operating Officer and President of buybuy BABY. John?

John R. Hartmann - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, COO & President of buybuy BABY Inc.
Thank you, Cindy. And to add to your conversation on the pivot and focus on our customer, let me provide an update on our buybuy BABY business.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 On a directional basis, our U.S. and Canadian buybuy BABY business made up approximately 10% of the company's total net sales in the second
quarter, including strong sales from digital, which represented more than half of total baby sales.

Growth in digital was supported by favorable customer response to our new BOPIS and Curbside Pickup offerings and our Big-Deal Baby Sale event,
which was held in August.

Digital orders fulfilled by our stores represented about 1/3 of total baby sales in the quarter with BOPIS representing 1/3 of total store fulfilled
orders. Top-performing baby categories during the quarter were apparel, safety and playroom, which helped us drive a more favorable product
margin.

During the second quarter, we opened our 128th baby store and subsequently opened another store in September. We expect to open 3 additional
stores by the end of the year for a total of 132 baby stores.

As the leading baby specialty retailer in North America, we are committed to expanding our buybuy BABY store network to support our digital
presence and omnichannel strategy and look forward to sharing our vision and growth strategies for baby at our upcoming Investor Day.

From an operations perspective, we took bold steps in nearly every area of our operations this quarter to evolve our base and build momentum
for change. I will highlight a few of these areas today: in real estate with our previously communicated Store Network Optimization project, in
strategic sourcing with our indirect sourcing initiative and in technology with our migration to cloud computing.

But first, as you've seen in the media, we have really powered up the team over the past 2 months with the addition of several senior leaders,
including Wade Haddad, SVP of Real Estate and Construction; Juan Guerrero, Chief Supply Chain Officer; Scott Lindblom, Chief Technology Officer;
and Anu Gupta, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer. These next-level leaders will help further advance and fortify our transformation initiatives
underway.

In real estate, we have begun executing on our Store Network Optimization plan to develop the right network of stores to serve our customers as
we rebuild our authority and establish a truly omni-always shopping experience. We recently confirmed that the first 1/3 of the 200 Bed Bath &
Beyond store closures that we previously announced will occur by the end of calendar 2020. As part of this process, there will be store closing sales
in the weeks leading up to the close to work down in-store inventory. In addition, a comprehensive sales and marketing program has been
established to drive sales to our other stores and digital channels. As we said previously, we expect to be able to transition at least 15% to 20% of
sales from these planned store closures to our digital channels or other store locations.

Our Store Network Optimization project is not simply to close stores but to reshape and truly optimize our store footprint. Our physical stores are
a strategic asset for us as we transform as a digital-first company. Market data shows that our current store base addresses 80% of the domestic
market. This is especially important as we further leverage our stores with new omni fulfillment capabilities in BOPIS, curbside and now Same Day
Delivery. Following this work, we will lean into a store remodel program next year that has been developed to have a clear and positive ROI and
deliver a truly omni-always and inspirational shopping experience. I look forward to sharing more on these growth plans at our Investor Day. This
is an important step in our multiyear program to build a modern, durable business model and to invest where it matters most, to our digital-first
customers.

Another area we are focusing resources is strategic sourcing. Our newly formed procurement organization will drive anticipated savings by designing
and implementing centralized spend control and vendor management processes across all areas of indirect spend. This recently launched initiative
will deliver substantial savings in fiscal 2021 and beyond. These savings exclude the impact of any potential future sale of noncore assets or any
changes to our real estate lease agreements.

From an operations perspective, at the core of our transformation is technology. We have initiated an end-to-end modernization of our technology
infrastructure to deliver a more agile, responsive and customer-inspired shopping experience.

Today, our digital platform is supporting substantial digital growth and strong customer adoption of new services like BOPIS and curbside.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Recently, we announced a new multiyear collaboration with Google and supported by Deloitte to accelerate our omni-always transformation.
Through this expanded relationship, we will deploy a range of platform solutions to further personalize our omnichannel shopping experience for
our customers, enhance fulfillment capacity and optimize merchandising planning and demand forecasting.

By combining our unique data and insights in the home, baby and beauty and wellness markets with the exceptional platform capabilities and
expertise that Google with their cloud capabilities provide, we will deliver a more agile, responsive and customer-inspired shopping experience,
making it even easier to feel at home with Bed Bath & Beyond.

As we build our omni-always capabilities, we will have a strong foundation of systems to support our long-term growth objectives. Our near-term
technology road map includes a new enterprise resource planning system, including core merchandising and further supply chain improvements
such as optimizing processes for omnichannel forecast, replenishment and allocation. The result will be noticeable improvements for our customers
while lowering our overall inventory investment.

I look forward to sharing more details with you on these important investments when we get together again at the end of the month at our Investor
Day.

Mark, I'll turn it back over to you now for closing remarks.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, John.

We've been making bold pivots to reconstruct, renovate and restore our company even despite the impact of a global pandemic. We said we would
assemble a world-class and experienced leadership team, and we've done that. We said we will reduce our cost structure and drive financial strength
and discipline, and we are doing that. We said we would take a smarter, more efficient approach to gross margin and management of our business,
and we're doing that. And we said we would lead with a digital-first, omni-always perspective, and we're doing that. We said we would modernize
our engagement to regain our authority in the home space to acquire new customers, and we're doing that. We said we will review and optimize
our asset base, and we have done that and expect to do more.

We're excited to share the details of our growth plans for the future. Our virtual Investor Day on October 28 starts at 9 a.m., and during this meeting,
we will provide a full review of our 3-year strategic goals, a multiyear financial plan incorporating anticipated cost savings and reinvestments, key
performance metrics that will track the progression of our transformation journey and a comprehensive capital allocation framework to building
long-term shareholder value.

Our strong performance this quarter, including solid comp sales growth, gross margin expansion, increased cash and liquidity and debt reduction,
gives us the confidence that our transformation is underway.

With that, we will now take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Peter Benedict from Baird.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Peter Sloan Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Two questions. First, just on the e-commerce fulfillment dynamics. Can you maybe frame some of the savings you think you're getting from the
store-based fulfillment relative to a traditional DTC? And then -- and also related to that, kind of how the economics or maybe the same-day
partnership that you announced with Shipt and Instacart kind of plays into the e-commerce profitability. That's my first question.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you. Let me start and maybe John can support.

So in terms of the economics, we've talked about, about 36% of our orders currently and growing are being fulfilled by store, with a large chunk
of those being BOPIS and curbside, which, for us economically, equate to an in-store sale from a profit margin perspective.

On our store fulfill, we're actually able to create speed and agility to get customers their goods much faster from the store base. And we're continuing
to work on the cost structure of a store fulfill versus DC cost as we rapidly move into this phase of fulfillment during the COVID environment.

In terms of the same-day order fulfillment -- sorry, the direct-to-customer fulfillment through same day, that is really equivalent to an in-store sale
as well. The customer nominates to spend the nominal fee basically for the cup of -- cost of a cup of coffee to get the order shipped. And that's at
$4.99, and we cover the cost of goods, but the shipping cost is covered by the customer.

Peter Sloan Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. That's great.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Also...

Peter Sloan Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
And then -- sorry, go ahead.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. Go ahead.

Peter Sloan Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Just a -- and then my other follow-up was just around kind of where you guys are in establishing category roles from a merchandising
standpoint. Just kind of curious which categories you're going to see the most impact when you have these own brand introductions next year
and how you kind of plan to communicate all this to consumers. Now a lot of this may come out, I guess, at the investor meeting, but just what
can you help us with here on that front?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Peter, definitely looking forward to sharing deeper details of our own brand and category trajectory for 2021 and beyond. But what I will tell
you is we've done a deep amount of research and understanding the strength of our categories currently and the opportunities that lie ahead.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And it's no surprise that they really fall into the bed, bath, kitchen and storage and org areas. And they're areas that we've been doubling down in
Q2 and will -- for third and fourth quarter, but we'll really expand those and double down our own brand opportunities as we kind of launch
throughout 2021. So more to follow on that, but we have clear category definition of goals. We're tracking discovery, ease and convenience and
trips and traffic in each of the categories and have a very distinct plan.

Operator
Our next question is from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities.

Steven Paul Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst
Maybe somewhat of a follow-up as we look at the building blocks of the gross margin walk in the presentation.

The 190 basis points of distribution fulfillment leverage, can you sort of help us better understand the drivers of that? Is that what you referred to
as sort of the change in -- or shift in the mix of fulfillment methods relative to last year? And I don't know if you have the ability or want to quantify
the differences in fulfillment cost across those different methods, but it would be -- it would help us sort of better understand the BOPIS/curbside
opportunity as it continues to build here.

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Steve, Gustavo here. So clearly, we're really focused on driving each of the components of our gross margin, fulfillment cost being one of those.
And to your specific question of 190 basis points, that includes benefit of scale and deleveraging some of our costs, distribution costs, labor costs.
And we expect to continue improving on that to offset the channel mix impact, which we're planning for, by continued driving BOPIS. You heard
Cindy in her remarks talking about how BOPIS is one of the key elements we will be focusing on.

So we're very pleased by the progress we've made in gross margin year-on-year not only by leveraging fulfillment costs but also by improving
product mix. And with that, we -- more than half of the anticipated digital channel mix. Does that help?

Steven Paul Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst
Yes. No, I think -- I don't know if you can sort of talk about the differences in regions or if there's any sort of range of penetration mix, right? So 15%
if we look at across hardlines, retail or obviously a broader retail subset. I mean do you have certain regions that are running at higher penetrations?
Or where do you sort of expect BOPIS/curbside to go over that 2- to 3-year time horizon?

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
What we're focused on is ensuring that we have a very responsive supply chain, which is part of the reason we're talking about supply chain
reinvention. So we will satisfy what our customers want. And we will get to the digital channel mix that our customers demand and the BOPIS mix
that our customer demands. In Investor Day, we are going to show more perspective on how we see that playing out and how we plan to address
the -- optimize the fulfillment cost of the different route to markets, whether it is from store, direct from vendors, direct to consumer, same-day
delivery, et cetera. Okay?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. And Steve, I'll just say also, too, this has become a new customer norm. We've just begun the journey with BOPIS. We're seeing that 15%
penetration increase on a regular basis, and we expect to see that being a real strength during the third and fourth quarter. We're building this
into our plan as a sustainable part of our mix. So we look forward to sharing more at the Investor Day.

Steven Paul Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Analyst
If I can, just a quick follow-up, Mark, for you. I mean when we look at the second quarter performance and the margin profile and then think about,
right, the profit improvement plan, obviously a really strong quarter, right, relative to what you sort of are guiding people to for that 2- to 3-year
time horizon on the margin profile. Is there anything to call out here that's somewhat transitory in nature? Or as we think about the third quarter
here, should we just expect sort of a build in the profitability of the underlying business?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. I think what you're seeing, Steve, is the disciplines that we'll be deploying moving forward. I mean when we used the word modernize a fair
bit through our discussion this morning, I think it really does go to what we're doing in gross margin in terms of merchandise mix, doubling down
on careful curation and usage of promotions and coupon, how we're communicating and engaging with our customer and then offering these
new services, which are both easy and convenient but help us in our profit margin.

So I think what you're seeing is the substructure of the disciplines that we've now applied to our business best practice and applying those through
the third and fourth quarter and beyond. And you're going to see further evidence of that as we go into the Investor Day, where we layer up even
more opportunities for gross margin growth through sourcing and own brand, et cetera. So we look forward to continuing that discussion with
you.

And our next question is from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Bradley Bingham Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment in which you are participating in and how you're thinking that may
evolve here as we move into October and the holidays, particularly as you're seeing retailers pull forward holiday promotions and Prime Day falling
in October now.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I think we're really pleased, Brad, to be in an environment where it is truly competitive. Our stores are open. We're firing on digital, and we're
able to compete actively versus how we could in the first quarter.

I think it's a competitive environment. And what we're really pleased with is how the customers really leaned in, both current and new, to their
relationship with Bed Bath & Beyond.

I think relationships and engagement are going to be very important. There's no doubt that this will be a third and fourth quarter unlike no other.
I think customers, we're seeing from our data points, will begin to shop earlier for value and for the holidays, and we're adjusting accordingly like
many retailers. So we think it's going to be competitive.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 It's going to be different. We are agile and flexible, and we've built our plans accordingly and are ready to roll. So we're really looking forward to
getting into it.

But as we said with the first sites we've seen through the month of September have been encouraging, but the rubber really hits the road from
Thanksgiving onwards when we see that change in shopping pattern and behavior.

Bradley Bingham Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - Director and Equity Research Analyst
Very helpful, Mark. And a follow-up on some of the monthly cadence that you disclosed, which I think was very helpful, thank you so much.
Wondering if you could share a little more color on what you were seeing from a traffic perspective.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. From a traffic perspective, obviously, our overall sales result, great omnichannel traffic, and I think that's the key to the door. For us, a digital
sale can be represented by someone buying digitally and picking up in store. So the power of our omnichannel sales is really driving our results.

Overall traffic was good. I think we're still seeing some tentativeness specifically in certain regions about a return to shopping, and we think that,
that will grow. And we're seeing data that suggest customers getting more comfortable with shopping in-store.

We're not back to normal circumstances at all, but I think this is where the power of accelerating digital and balancing out to become truly
omni-always has really leaned into our favor. So we're meeting the customer where they are, when they're ready and what they need. So I think
that we're seeing traffic differentials, but we see ongoing trends changing, and we're going to be watching those.

And our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS.

Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst of Consumer Hardlines
Presumably, August was the best comp month within the quarter. Your commentary suggested that September was equal to the full -- that the
comp trend in September was equal to the full second quarter, suggesting that September has slowed versus where August trended. Why do you
think that's the case?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We're seeing stability against the quarter and against the trends we're evolving through the month of August, both at store and digital levels, down
to our margin and BOPIS rates. So we're seeing a stability in that.

We won't comment any further on our Q3 results but wanted to ensure that we were not saying that was just a one moment in time based on
home being important in the industry. And with the customer mindset, this is developing a pattern with our customers that we feel very comfortable
with.

Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst of Consumer Hardlines
So Mark, just want to clarify because there probably will be a lot of discussion about this. When you say stability in September, do you mean stability
in September versus August? Or stability in September versus the entire second quarter?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Michael, Gustavo here. What we mean stability is consistency in the growth rates. So we're seeing growth rates in September that are similar to
the growth rate we've seen in the second quarter, both on a digital growth basis and comp basis.

And to your question about trends within the second quarter because, as Mark said, we don't want to get into too much specific into the third
quarter other than saying the results we're seeing so far are, again, consistent in terms of growth, is we saw consistent growth in digital in each
and every one of the 3 months in the second quarter, June, July, August. We saw digital growth north of 80%, as I said in my prepared remarks, and
we're very encouraged by that.

Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - MD and Equity Research Analyst of Consumer Hardlines
Okay. And then 2 more on gross margin. To what extent do you think that you're able to lower your coupon expense because the overall environment
will be -- was just less promotional? And so how much of that factor in?

And as part of the gross margin, how much should we incorporate the fact that shipping and freight costs are going to be going up considerably
into the fourth quarter and probably into next year as we calibrate our models moving forward?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, Michael, I mean, again, there's going to be pressure on, I think, time frames in terms of shipping and moving forward. I think we've calibrated
that into our go-forward plans. We feel

good about that. In terms of the gross margin costs, we feel really solid that in terms of coupon, yes, the market was less promotional in total, and
we accounted for that. But for us, we're embarking on a journey on how we use our resources more effectively and strategically. So coupon for us
is a strength and it's an opportunity used correctly. So in the careful curation of it, testing and iterating as we did through Q2, we see real upside
benefits to how we use the coupon. And so it was more about our strategic intent than it was the market dynamic, but both of them worked in
our favor.

Operator
And our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.

Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director
I have a -- first, a short term and then a medium term. My short term is SG&A dollar growth in Q3, how to think about it, if you're able to share given
that, I guess, store expenses will be more fully ramped up by that quarter.

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Gustavo here. Look, we're not going to provide specific guidance in our P&L components beyond our actual results, Q3. What I can say is we're
fully committed to continue driving SG&A down as we saw in the first quarter. We also saw some deleverage in the second quarter. And keep in
mind that some of the restructuring interventions that we've announced recently are going to start ramping up into the third and the fourth quarter.
So we're committed to continue optimizing our cost structure, and you'll see more of that to come.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Executive Director
And then the more efficient promotions and markdown management, I assume that's also helping the ticket on the top line. Is that a meaningful
lift? Or is it more just more impactful to the gross margin line?

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
It's more impactful to the gross margin line. We're becoming much more disciplined on how we look at our data, how we optimize promotions, as
Mark said, how we manage coupons. You'll see that more reflected in the gross margin line, which is part of the 150 basis points product mix, gross
margin improvement driver.

Operator
And our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.

Katharine Amanda McShane - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst
I wondered if I could go back to the comp question earlier. You did mention that you'll be closing the 200 stores by the end of the year. Is there a
way to quantify the store comp of those 200 stores and how big the gap is between their performance and the rest of the fleet?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Hey Kate, that really pertains to how we'll be performing in the third and fourth quarter. So we won't be sharing that data today other than we're
fairly comfortable that the 63 stores that we're closing have been built into our plans. We'll have accelerated sales based on closure sales, which
will be advantageous there, and we can absorb that inside the side of our fleet, and we've got comfortable plans there.

Katharine Amanda McShane - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity Analyst
Okay. And then my second question is just on inventories. I wondered if you could update us on the quality of inventory in the store, how you feel
about in-stocks going into the back half of the year.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. We're definitely trading on leaner inventory, which is partly by design and partly based on the sales accelerating and the availability of inventory.
I think the industry overall is buckling down and ensuring that we get the right levels of inventory for the third and fourth quarter. We have our
plans in place and working closely with our vendor base.

We feel that the quality of the inventory is very, very strong. We continue to chase and replenish as much as possible for our key items. We're
hyper-focused on our top-performing items going into the third and fourth quarter, which we know last year that was one of our Achilles' heels.
And we think that we have a better promotional cadence, which will help us get through with better quality and size of inventory. So we're operating
leaner and better. With the right inventories, it bodes well for the future.

And our next question is from Bobby Griffin from Raymond James.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Robert Kenneth Griffin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate
I guess, Mark, first, in the slide deck, you called out the potential for additional asset sales on some noncore assets. If those sales went through on
the other noncore assets remaining, would that potentially unlock further savings than you've already kind of detailed in that initial restructuring
plan?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
The asset sales, we've factored into our forward plans in terms of if there was any action there, which we're not declaring here today, Bobby, but
we think that we've factored in the SG&A going forward. That'll be a bit of a nonissue really because we've already taken action with -- inside each
of the assets to date, and that was part of our restructuring plan. So they've been banked. So anything that comes forward in terms of asset sales
will just be a net benefit in terms of cash flow.

Robert Kenneth Griffin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate
Okay. That's helpful. And then just -- go ahead, I'm sorry.

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. Over to you.

Robert Kenneth Griffin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Senior Research Associate
And I guess -- okay, I just -- and my last one is just a modeling question on kind of the spread between comps and net sales. It looked like kind of
roughly 7 points this quarter. I would assume -- is it safe to assume that's going to widen a little bit as we go through the store closures? And to
help us tune up our model, should we think of that 7 points plus some store closures for the next 3 or 4 quarters to keep us in line with how things
are trending?

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Gustavo here. Two -- let me address that. I understand completely the context of your question, and it's a very important one. We're paying more
and more attention to comp growth as we continue reshaping the portfolio of the company both in terms of concepts and stores. So let me address
it in 2 parts.

First, in the second quarter, the big difference between store comp and reported sales, think of it -- so during the month of June, right, first in the
total quarter, we had reported sales on stores down 18% and comp store performance down 12%. So you're seeing that 6-point -- this delta into
the stores. And part of that is driven because in the month of June -- remember, in the month of June, we were starting opening gradually our
stores. So that big delta is primarily driven by the month of June, where in June store sales were down close to 25% while store comp -- store only
was down mid-single digits.

So looking forward, we are looking, as part of the program that John is leading, in optimizing the 200 stores, 63 coming this fiscal year. We will be
closing the stores that are less productive. Now it's very hard to predict what's the impact on comp growth going forward, but rest assured that
we will provide that perspective as we report our results each quarter. Was that -- hope that, that helps.

And our next question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan.

Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So first, a question about how you're prioritizing the store closings. I know you're basing the stores on sort of historical performance. But prior to
this year, you really didn't have a true omnichannel platform. So how you're prioritizing these first 63. Are they sort of the most EBITDA-negative
stores? Or are they just were more of the most adjacency and closest to another Bath & Beyond store? Just trying to understand those 63.

And then on the 200, do you think as you build out omni you might revisit the overall closing target?

John R. Hartmann - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, COO & President of buybuy BABY Inc.
Yes, Christopher, this is John. Thank you for your question. Look, we've undertaken a very deep analysis around our network, and we focused in
on several key areas. The first is unprofitable stores. The second is stores that are too close to one another. And the third is where we have lease
arrangements that are burdensome to the profitability of the store. So we've undertaken a deep analysis to identify the stores that should be closed.
And from there, this first roughly 1/3 we've announced, we'll be closing by the end of the year.

Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Got it. And then 2 one-off questions. Based on prior disclosure, it looks like e-commerce mix actually goes down in the third quarter. I'm not sure
if that's true in September given back-to-college, but if you're holding e-commerce trends consistent and store comps consistent, that would
suggest deceleration relative to 2Q. So just trying to see if there's a nuance there.

And secondly, in the first quarter, you did have a benefit from an accounting change of about 300 bps in gross margin year-over-year. So I was
trying to see what that benefit was in this quarter as well.

Gustavo Arnal - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Sure. Gustavo here. First, on your question on the trends throughout the quarter. As mentioned before, we have seen consistent digital sales growth
of above 80% in each one of the months in the second quarter, and we continue seeing that trend in the month of September. So we feel pretty
good about that.

And your question about the accounting change, it was an adjustment and refinement on how we record some of our fulfillment costs into gross
margin. Specifically into making numeric, it has no impact on total EBITDA. On gross margin in the second quarter, the impact was 150 basis points,
okay? It's as anticipated. In the first quarter, it was 300 basis points. So it was less than half given that our revenues have doubled more or less
quarter-to-quarter.

Operator
Our next question is from Curt Nagle from Bank of America.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Curtis Smyser Nagle - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP
So maybe I'll just stick to 1 question on capital allocation. So looking at the quarter, you guys had a substantially improved EBITDA and arguably
too much cash on the books with $300 million net against debt. More cash are going to come from free cash flow and asset sales potentially. So
where do we stand in terms of reengaging the buyback? Are we still restricted? When could we expect you guys back in the market?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Thanks for recognizing the strong fiscal position. It's definitely what we've been building towards.

You can see us coming at the end of the month and having a real clear point of view on our full 3-year plan in terms of capital expenditure and
allocation. That will provide real clarity on how we intend to use our liquidity and cash strength to generate strength for our business and modernize
as well as return to shareholders. So we look forward to sharing more then.

Curtis Smyser Nagle - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - VP
Okay. Maybe I'll just sneak one more quick one in to you, Mark, in terms of merchandising mix. So kind of looking back to the back half of last year,
things were a bit messy to say the least: out of stocks, not having the right inventory. How much of a difference do you think you guys can make
with some of your new -- early merchandising plans in the back half in terms of comps and perhaps better margin?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I mean as we've kind of detailed through the quarterly results back then, there were some self-inflicted wounds. And I think this team has
moved with agility and skill around a different strategic mindset.

So I think as you saw in the back-to-college period, you saw us representing clear value on -- end caps and clarity and alignment between digital
and stores. You saw us in-stock of key items. You saw us have really meaningful promotions that were targeted to specific customers and, to the
best of our ability post -- coming out of the whole blip of COVID, really getting back to in-stocks of the items that our customers wanted.

We've built a robust plan for the third and fourth quarter to focus on our top items being in stock, to curate that promotional plan and to be a
meaningful storyteller to the customers about their needs, and I think it's going to be very different than fourth quarter. So we really look forward
to using the blueprint of how we're managing inventory focused on best sellers and key items, our promotional cadence, clarifying and communicating
great price/value and using our omnichannel services to really bring a very different third and fourth quarter.

Operator
And we have time for one more question. And the last question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities.

Seth Mckain Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD Of Equity Research
My first question is just on some of the underlying improvements you made in gross margins, which have been very strong in a short order of time.
As we think about the go-forward plan here in the back half of the year, you've elaborate on some of the drivers being sustainable. And I know
you're not providing financial guidance, but is there anything that you did in the second quarter that we should think about not being sustainable
in the back half of the year in terms of the gross margin year-over-year performance?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks for the question. No, we think that the efforts we undertook in Q2 are very sustainable and are a good runway to our efforts in the third
and fourth. The mix becomes rebalanced. We've doubled down on meaningful promotions and curation of promotions and our coupon. We're
ready for the promotional period. We're ready for the gift-giving period. Our stocks are looking better, as I just mentioned.

I think that -- and also, too, we see a ramping up of the BOPIS penetration rate as well as the addition of same day. So there are some really good
levers there that just were nonexistent in 3, 4 last year that are going to be in play, and we already have proof-of-concept and green shoots on
from Q2 that we see prevailing into third and fourth quarter.

Seth Mckain Basham - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD Of Equity Research
That's great perspective. And then lastly, as it relates to some of the new customers that you've acquired, can you talk to the repurchase activity
you've seen from them thus far relative to prior cohorts of new customers? Are you seeing them more sticky? And do you think that's a positive
driver going forward?

Mark J. Tritton - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We're seeing them engaged, and we're definitely collating more data and engagement with them. And what we're seeing in that is a younger
customer who may not have as much discretionary income, but they're very focused on their home. So we've seen key areas like home decor really
fly and the kitchen area. So they're investing early, and we think they're going to invest frequently. We're going to be connecting with them,
engaging them and looking at them for long-term value and engagement.

Erich Mauff - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Director
Welcome to Jushi's first ever Investor Day. We really appreciate everyone's attendance. We are excited to showcase Jushi's assets, our incredible
team, our company's vision. The agenda today will start with me, Erich Mauff, Co-President and Co-founder, giving an overview of our company
and our assets. Then both John Barack, Co-President and Co-Founder; and Kim Bambach, Chief Financial Officer, will review our current financials
and our 2021 guidance. Closing the first session, James Cacioppo, CEO, Chairman and Co-Founder, will review our company's ethos and his vision
for Jushi. After Jim, we will preview our operating businesses. We will start with manufacturing, processing and cultivation. Then we will review
our retail franchise and customer experience.

Next will be an update on procurement and products, followed by business development. Weaving this together, we will hear about our digital
strategy and branding, and then have an update on Jushi. We will conclude the Investor Day with a Q&A.

Our current asset portfolio is split into 3 core and 3 development markets. Our core markets, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Illinois, (inaudible) scale
and dominance. In our development markets, Ohio, Nevada and California, we are actively looking into scaling our current footprint over the next
12 months.

Let me start with the with Virginia, the sleeping giant. Virginia's population is 8.7 million. This is a newly established medical program, commencing
operations later this year. Structure of the program. The regulators have broken the state into 5 separate geographic regions called Health Service
Areas or HSAs with one vertically integrated license per HSA. Each permit holder is required to be vertically integrated, meaning cultivation,
extraction and processing and retail, all within the same facility. Recently, each permit holder was awarded the option of adding 5 additional
stand-alone dispensaries for a total of 6 locations. These 5 additional dispensaries need to be within the permit holders designated HSA.

Jushi's majority-owned Dalitso LLC is one of 5 applicants to have received conditional approval by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy and is now one
of 4, to have received final approval.

We anticipate opening the facility late in the fourth quarter of 2020. The designated service area for Jushi to operate is Health Service Area II in
Northern Virginia.

HSA 2 is the smallest, most densely populated Health Service Area of the state, with 2.5 million people, nearly 30% of the state's population according
to the U.S. Census Bureau. HSA 2 borders the Potomac River right across from Washington, D.C. our region includes iconic suburbs such as Arlington,
Tysons Corner, Alexandria, Manassas and includes 2 of the Virginia's highest income counties, Fairfax and Prince William County. In fact, Health
Service Area II is home to 5 of Virginia's 10 wealthiest neighborhoods.

Geographic size and population density are important because; one, population density is a critical retail driver. We are blessed in Health Service
Area II with 2.5 million residents, but we will benefit from a large commuter population. Northern Virginia's techup dominated by millennials is in

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Health Service Area II. This population are early cannabis adopters, and they will drive the medical program today and adult-use in the future. Two,
Virginia allows home delivery, operating in highly urbanized technology-enabled environment is optimal for delivery. HSA 2 is a concentrated
small geographic area that will allow Jushi to dominate home delivery. Interestingly, Amazon selected Crystal City, Arlington, for their HQ2 after
an exhaustive 5-year search.

Crystal City is in our Health Service Area, which we believe supports our optimism, aggressive projections and demographic assumptions. During
2021, we expect to open 5 additional stores in Health Service Area II. Preferred locations currently are, Fairfax, Leesburg, Falls Church, Woodbridge,
Arlington and Tysons Corner, our vertically integrated facility.

We went big with a customer (inaudible) Our primary facility in Manassas includes cultivation, manufacturing and processing, plus a retail dispensary.
We have a 93,000 square foot custom-built state of the art facility, Phase I, partial build out. We are building out approximately 30,000 square feet;
cultivation, 6,000 square feet; 2 flower rooms, double stack. We expect to be able to produce 6,000 pounds of dried flower annually; processing
and manufacturing, 3,000 square feet.

This state of the art CO2 extraction facility has the capacity to process up to 32,000 pounds of biomass annually. Our lab and kitchen will manufacture
high quality medically infused products as flower is not currently permitted in Virginia, Phase II, full build out. At full capacity, the facility will have
the following annual output cultivation, 27,000 pounds of dried flower in 9 double-stack for flower rooms, processing and manufacturing. We have
the capacity to process up to 64,000 pounds of biomass.

Brands. The robust medical program in the state currently allows for vaporization, tinctures, capsules and soft gels. We anticipate flower being
allowed sometime in 2021. Our award-winning private brands cover all these categories. The Lab for concentrates and vaporization, tastetology
for infused edibles, Nira Plus for tinctures, capsules and soft gels, and when allowed, the bank for flower products.

Our largest national footprint is in Pennsylvania, which we view as the next Illinois. Pennsylvania's population is 12.8 million. This is an established
medical market.

Structure of the program. Licenses are split into 2, either retail or grower processor, vertical integration align both is allowed. Currently, there are
150 retail licenses and 25 grower processor licenses. There is a separate medical registrar program that will allow up to an additional 48 retail
locations and 8 grower processes. Since inception, Pennsylvania's medical cannabis program has had total sales of $1.3 billion.

Currently, there are roughly 90 operational dispensaries, almost 400,000 registered medical cannabis patients and caregivers.

Retail. Jushi has the right to operate 15 retail dispensaries in Pennsylvania, 8 are currently operational. And we anticipate having all 15 retail
dispensaries opened by mid-2021. We have an option to acquire an additional 3 retail locations. This option expires in February 2022 and is subject
to approvals from all appropriate regulatory authorities. Our stores are generally concentrated in 3 large urban populations and the adjacent
suburbs, which are Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Scranton.

In the Greater Philadelphia suburbs, we have 4 operational stores. Bristol, our oldest and highest revenue-generating store. West Chester is a
stand-alone former bank building on Route 3 Westchester Pike. 40,000 cars per day pass this address. Ardmore, adjacent to Suburban Square, the
premier shopping destination in suburban Philadelphia. Reading, located downtown in the fifth largest city in Pennsylvania.

In Downtown Philadelphia, we have 2 operational stores. Center City is at 12th & Sansom in the heart of Philli's Midtown Village. Northern Liberties
is at 5th and spring Garden and one of Philadelphia's fastest-growing neighborhoods. In Downtown Philadelphia, we have 2 stores under development,
University City at the intersection of the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University's campuses.

(inaudible) , this will be the second dispensary in Delaware County, large population based adjacent to West Philadelphia. In the Pittsburgh area,
we have 1 operational store and 2 under construction. Historic Johnstown, we have an operational store 1 of only 2 dispensaries in Cambria county.
The other 2 locations under construction are Downtown Pittsburgh, 5,000 square foot store in the center of the main entertainment district on the
South side of the city; Irwin, a stand-alone 3,600 square-foot building on the main commercial throughway of a vibrant Pittsburgh suburb.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 In Scranton, we have one operational store. Downtown Scranton, located just off I-81 in a strip center anchored by a CBS and Dunkin' Donuts. We
have additional locations under development in Eastern. Pottsville, a former bank building at the intersection of main and center in downtown
Pottsville. There are no other dispensaries for 30 minutes in any direction.

Hazleton, beyond our low will be the only dispensary for 40 minutes in any direction. Now let's take a look at our newly acquired 90,000 square
foot grower processor in Scranton. Phase I, dial-in and upgrade the existing facility.

The expanded facility from 20,000 to 45,000 square feet of indoor cultivation is now operational. Our team is taking the existing miss managed
facility and optimizing cultivation efficiencies, implementing best practices, upgrading outdated technologies and bringing in automation. Once
our cultivation team finalizes these upgrades, we expect this facility to yield between 8,000 and 10,000 pounds of dried flower annual.

Our current supercritical CO2 extraction technology produces an assortment of products, including vaporization, tinctures, soft gels and topicals.
Our development plans include the construction of a Class I, division 1 room to add hydrocarbon extraction. This will allow for the introduction of
additional concentrates like live resin and other innovative products.

Phase II, build out additional indoor cultivation. We have the ability to easily increase the indoor cultivation area by an additional 25,000 square
feet bringing total canopy to 70,000 square feet. At full capacity, the facility will yield over 17,000 pounds of dry flower annually, processing and
manufacturing and the capacity to process up to 100,000 pounds of biomass annually.

Phase III, maximize grower process equipment. We also have an LOI to purchase 2 additional pieces of land adjacent to our facilities that will add
another 50,000 to 75,000 square feet of facility footprint. Jushi Scranton's grower processor will provide private label products for our BEYOND/HELLO
retail franchise and allow wholesale across the state.

We plan on utilizing our award-winning brands, The Lab, The Bank and Nira Plus. Illinois is the best cannabis market in the U.S. Illinois' population
12.7 million. The program transitioned January 1, 2020, or medical-only to both adult-use and medical. Structure of the program. Licenses are split
into 2, either retail or grower processor, vertical integration, owning both is allowed. The program is 110 current license dispensary.

There is an application process that will add an additional 75 for a total of 185 dispensaries in the state. There are 21 grower processor licenses. We
are in 2 prime areas in Illinois. One, Bloomington-Normal, in the middle of the state, where we have 2 licenses. Sauget, just south of East St. Louis,
where we have an additional 2 licenses. In Bloomington-Normal, we have one operational dispensary with our second dispensary opening by
year-end. First move advantage (inaudible) are opened in prime on prime locations, build customer loyalty and ingrain ourselves into the community.

The next closest competitor is 36 miles away, about a 40-minute drive. Our second zone, in Illinois, East St. Louis Sauget is our crown jewel. The
greater St. Louis area, that's Missouri and Illinois has, a population of 2.2 million people, operating Sauget location is currently the highest performing
store in our national retail network. We are building our second dispensary very close to downtown St. Louis. Sauget is home to the iconic night
clubs, Pop's and Oz, adult entertainments, Diamonds and Country Rock and the renowned Sauget outdoor concert venues.

Our store will have ample parking, a vibrant 24-hour night life, and is a 5- to 7-minute drive from St. Louis Cardinals Busch stadium. Now that we've
covered our primary markets, I'd like to run you through our 3 development markets starting with Ohio.

Population of Ohio is 11.7 million. Structure of the program. Recent medical markets, you can vertically integrate (inaudible) an extraction and
processing in Columbus. We are constructing a new 8,000 square foot state of the art CO2 extraction facility that will utilize ethanol in post process.
Once complete, this facility will have the capacity to process up to 32,000 pounds biomass. We're building out a kitchen and lab that will produce
all allowable products in Ohio, anticipate opening in early 2021.

Nevada. Nevada's population is 3.1 million. This is an adult-use and medical market. Jushi owns 2, 7,500 square foot buildings that can be easily
connected. Attached to these buildings are 2 permits, 1 for cultivation and another for processing and manufacturing. We currently operate out
of one building.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In this facility, Jushi has a state of the art indoor double-stack cultivation that yields 2,500 pounds of high quality dry flower per year. In processing
and manufacturing, we produce a suite of infused product. We've partnered with third-party extraction to produce high quality concentrates and
infused (inaudible), all for the wholesale marketing in Nevada. We are reviewing options to connect our 2 buildings allowing Jushi to expand
cultivation, scale processing and manufacturing.

Nevada, and specifically, Las Vegas had suffered from COVID. State restrictions on cannabis stores, coupled of limited tourism have impacted many
Nevada cannabis operators. Distressed assets, coupled with new retail licenses opening, should present some attractive M&A opportunities.

California. Last but not least, our final development market, California. California's population is just under 40 million people. California has a
population larger than Canada and Australia with a median household income of $71,000. It's a mature, adult-use and medical market. Cali is the
heart and soul of cannabis in America. We have spent 3 years of research in California and are committed to scaling our footprint over the next 12
to 18 months.

We have 2 M&A professionals living in Los Angeles loss entities, doing nothing but analyzing the market, meeting with local operators and identifying
attractive opportunities. California is an unlimited license state. However, each locality can ban cannabis or limit the number of licenses. In fact,
about 70% of counties, so 7 out of 10 localities, don't allow cannabis.

Hence, there are a small number of highly sought after limited license markets and cities. An example of one of these cities is Santa Barbara. Beyond
(inaudible) Santa Barbara, we'll be only 3 licensed operators in this wonderful town. We have an amazing location and beautiful design. We are
very excited to be in Santa Barbara. As with Santa Barbara, we are moving forward with a merit-based application in Culver City.

We have found an absolutely prime location for our flagship dispensary on the corner of Sepulveda and Venice Boulevard. Our store will be
approximately 500 feet away from an exit of Interstate 405. 53,000 cars pass this location daily. This store will be new construction, a ground-up
build, focused on modern architecture and environmental sustainability. BEYOND/HELLO (inaudible) will be a 5,000 square foot stand-alone store
designed to mimic a greenhouse from next area and will be LEED Silver certified.

California is a core development market for Jushi. Our focus will be on distressed assets in retail, but we will consult vertical integration at the right
price. Now let me introduce you to John Barack, Co-President and Co-Founder; and Kim Bambach, Chief Financial Officer, who will review our
current financials and our 2021 guidance.

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, Erich. This is Kimberly Bambach. I am the CFO of Jushi Holdings, Inc. Since our founding in 2018, Jushi has been devoted to raising
capital to prudently invest in undervalued assets in the emerging legal and highly regulated cannabis and hemp markets in the U.S. Jushi had some
early wins, including acquiring a 16.5% stake in GSC, the parent company of Valley Agriceuticals and owner of one of the 10 New York licensed
medical cannabis operators in 2018 for $5 million, which we would later go on to sell in 2019 for 3 to 4x gain on investment. We chose to go public
early and before we had operating assets, as we determined it would be easier and faster to close many of the acquisitions that our business
development team had lined out for 2019, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Nevada, Ohio, New York, Colorado, it was an extremely busy year.

We started 2019 with 20 corporate employees, primarily focused on market research and acquisitions to ending the year as a public company with
209 employees handling cultivation, manufacturing and retail operations in 3 states with developing assets in Virginia, Ohio and California.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue was $10.2 million, gross profit was $4.8 million, and adjusted EBITDA was negative $11.2 million.
From a financial operations perspective, it was immeasurably harder to close acquisitions and stand up operating assets as a public cannabis
company than a typical U.S. SEC registrant. It is a balancing act to build just-in-time systems and infrastructure as we scale that meet our high
standards of control, process and quality requirements. We stood up a centralized financial service center early, and all acquisitions are integrated
within 60 days, the same financial systems, banking, payroll and KPI reporting.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 This keeps us efficient and accurate with administrative costs low and lean. It is very true to a certain extent that while we at Jushi have companies
operating both inside and outside cannabis or plant touching that the same regulatory ambiguities and hurdles still exist for all of our companies,
banking in the U.S., not to mention the tax treatments for plant touching operations from a federal state and local level that impacts our short-term
business economics.

We have to work harder at these basic services than other typical start-ups outside of cannabis. As we add additional acquisitions and open acquired
licenses, we do not expect to add significant corporate overhead expenses as a result of new store and new facility openings.

Some corporate expenses are expected to fluctuate based on onetime acquisition or deal-related expenses. In regards to our 2020 year-to-date
performance, as many of you are aware, Jushi reported very strong sequential revenue of approximately $15 million in the second quarter of 2020,
a 73% sequential quarterly increase, driven by strong revenue at our BEYOND/HELLO stores in Pennsylvania and Illinois. As a result of successful
procurement of greater quantities of both medical and recreational products, as demanded by our customers in these 2 supply-constrained markets.
Moreover, by leveraging recently implemented technology, we are more in tune with our customers' purchasing behaviors than ever before. Our
gross profit in the second quarter was $7.5 million, resulting in a gross margin of 50%, compared to $4.2 million with a gross margin of 48% in the
first quarter of 2020. We expect margins to continue to improve with the acquisition of PAMS in the third quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was a negative $1.2 million compared to a negative $6 million in the first quarter. As of August 31,
the company had $44.4 million in cash and $7.5 million in marketable securities, and is fully funded for the build-out of the current portfolio. We
anticipate investing $15 million to $20 million in building out current construction and progress during the second half of this year.

Total debt, excluding leases on the balance sheet as of August 31, was approximately $103 million, less cash, resulting in a net debt of approximately
$61 million. The company also, as of August 31, had approximately 108 million shares on an as converted basis. On a fully diluted basis, including
approximately $102 million of warrants and $9 million of options, the company would have 219 million shares outstanding. As discussed in our
second quarter earnings call, we began implementing several cost reduction initiatives across our network of retail stores with a focus on strengthening
our financial rigor and driving long-term profitability. These initiatives include the implementation of strategic purchasing practices, optimizing
our labor model and further leveraging our BEYOND-HELLO.com online platform. We are pleased to see significant improvement on our labor
costs as a percentage of revenue within our retail stores over the first half of 2020 and expect to see further improvements due to ease of online
pre ordering, curbside pickup and improved customer flow within each location.

In addition to staffing optimization, there are some higher expense areas unique to cannabis, such as banking, security, insurance and, of course,
280E tax limitations. Clearly, in some of these areas, only regulatory changes at the federal level will resolve. However, there are more and more
mainstream companies providing services to the industry, which will provide us with choices and competition to reduce costs in these areas. When
we look at our projections for the second half of 2020, in August, combined revenue for Jushi was over $8.5 million for the month or $102 million
annual run rate. We continue to see strong revenue growth as we exit the third quarter.

Our store revenue is approaching $2 million a week going into the end of August. We're thrilled with the performance of our operations in
Pennsylvania and Illinois. And as reported earlier this morning, we are pleased to provide preliminary third quarter revenue guidance of approximately
$24 million, which is at the high-end of our previously provided range.

We also expect to generate fourth quarter 2020 revenue at the high-end of our previously provided guidance of approximately $25 million to $30
million and continue to expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be positive.

I will now hand it over to John who will walk you through the build out of our 2021 revenue and adjusted EBITDA.

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Thank you, Kim. I'm John Barack, Co-Founder, Co-President and Corporate Secretary of Jushi, and I'll be providing a buildup of Jushi's full year 2021
guidance. Jushi previously provided revenue guidance for Q4 of $25 million to $30 million. As Kim mentioned just a moment ago, we expect to
                                                                                                                                                                             
 generate revenue at the high-end of this range. Jushi's second half projected revenue for this year is expected to total approximately $50 million
to $55 million. Full year 2020 revenue would be approximately $75 million under that scenario.

So how do we get from $75 million to our 2021 guidance of $200 million to $250 million? Focusing on Q4 of 2020, 2 biggest state contributors to
revenue are Jushi's Pennsylvania and Illinois businesses. In Q4, we're not opening any new stores in Pennsylvania. So we're still operating with a
store base of 8 out of 15 possible BEYOND/HELLO branded dispensaries.

These medical dispensaries have performed very well in one of the fastest-growing medical markets in the country. Furthermore, we also have an
option to acquire an additional 3 retail locations pending regulatory approval. We expect to achieve over $4 million of combined revenue per
month from these 8 stores, which we already achieved in August, or greater than $12 million from this retail base in Q4. The run rate at the end of
2020 is expected to be nearly $50 million. Rolling this business forward in 2021, we plan to open 7 additional stores over the course of the year.
We expect to open our ninth store in Pennsylvania in late Q1 and early Q2 with a steady pace of openings of about 1 per month until all 15 locations
are open, subject to regulatory approvals and the vagaries of construction.

Based on our open store Q4 performance, we expect a revenue run rate of approximately $50 million for our 8 operating stores. We believe a fully
built out store base of 15 locations can generate upwards of $100 million of annual retail revenue. However, given the intra-year opening schedule,
we're likely to end somewhere in the middle of that range for 2021 or at least $75 million in revenue, about 1/3 of our 2021 projection.

Remember, it's important to keep in mind these projections are based on the current market and current regs. i.e., medical-use only. In addition
to Jushi's retail presence in PA, we recently closed on an acquisition of the equity of a large grower processor facility, which we call PAMS. This
facility is operating with a recently expanded presence that is approximately 45,000 square feet of high quality indoor cultivation. When we took
over PAMS in mid Q3, it was producing only a couple of hundred pounds of biomass, i.e., flower and trim, on a monthly basis. We expect PAMS'
monthly biomass production to steadily increase through 2020 and more so in 2021 as the first new flowering rooms come online in Q4 2020, and
then as Jushi's experienced operations team improves the performance across the facility and other optimizing changes will result in a facility
producing between 1,500 to 2,000 pounds of flower and Trim per month by the end of 2021.

At this rate, PAMS will go from a facility generating about $1 million per month of revenue to about $5 million per month. We think PAMS can
contribute anywhere from $35 million to $45 million of revenue to Jushi on a gross basis in 2021.

By way of example of Jushi's BEYOND/HELLO dispensaries by 40% to 50% of PAM's products or about $15 million to $20 million in wholesale, then
PAMS will contribute $20 million plus in net sales to Jushi's PA business. Total Pennsylvania retail and grower processor net sales would be about
$95 million to $110 million under this scenario or between 40% to 50% of 2021 revenue. The next largest expected contributors in Q4 2020 are
Jushi's 2 dispensaries in Illinois, operating as both medical and adult-use dispensaries in Sauget and Normal Illinois. The 2 open stores have been
performing extremely well in the very fast-growing Illinois adult-use market.

In August, combined revenue for the 2 stores was over $3.7 million for the month or $45 million annual run rate. We also have the right to open 2
additional adult-use stores in the same area, one in Sauget, Illinois and one in Bloomington, Illinois, bringing our total store count to 4. We expect
to open the Sauget location in the middle of Q4 and the Bloomington location in early Q1. In 2021 with a full year of operating 4 stores, a pro rata
increase of our 2-store run rate could be as much as $90 million, but Illinois is adding new licenses at a faster rate than the market is expanding.

So we expect competition to mean that new stores won't be quite as productive as existing ones. Therefore, we're projecting a range between $70
million to $80 million of revenue from the 4 open stores during the year. The actual results will depend on a lot of factors, including how quickly
new stores open, ours and our competitor's, where they open, whether Jushi sees any acquisition opportunities within the state.

With this projected range, Illinois is expected to contribute approximately 1/3 of 2021 revenue. After Illinois, the next largest contributor in Jushi's
2021 revenue buildup is our newest operation, a majority stake in Dalitso, the holder of 1 of only 5 provisional medical cannabis licenses in Virginia,
and 1 of only 4 to have received final approval and permit issuance.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 As we've recently completed construction of our vertical facility in Manassas, Virginia, this brand-new medical market is expected to begin generating
material revenue starting in Q1 2021, and the rate of growth will depend on the rate of patient uptake.

As Erich previously mentioned, with the population of about 2.5 million people in our Health Service Area II of Northeast Virginia, the potential
patient base for medical cannabis products is significant. Additionally, we plan to provide a comprehensive suite of Jushi's brands, including our
award-winning brands, The Lab concentrates as well as our precision formulated line of medical cannabis products, Nira Plus at multiple
BEYOND/HELLO-branded dispensaries, given the newly approved regulations allow us to open up to 5 additional dispensaries.

We think the Virginia market could contribute anywhere from $17 million to $25 million of revenue next year. If we take the middle of the range,
we're at about $20 million or 8% to 10% of 2021 revenue for Jushi, with a lot of future growth in Virginia in 2022 and beyond as the market further
develops and matures with more patients, potentially more products such as flower and/or favorable regulatory developments and so forth.

So from Pennsylvania, Illinois and Virginia, we have a build of between $180 million to $215 million of revenue generated. The remaining approximately
$20 million to $40 million plus of revenue is a combination of our developing markets. In California, we're excited to announce in our Santa Barbara
stores and expect to open our Culver City, California store sometime in the middle of 2021 for a combined revenue of proximately $12 million to
$20 million in 2021.

In Nevada, we operate a cultivation and processing business that we put off expanding due to the COVID crisis and the state moratorium surrounding
with cannabis regs. However, following expansion, we expect the business to generate approximately $6 million to $10 million revenue. In Ohio,
we advised a local processing operator that we expect to take control of in early 2021.

We anticipate the business will generate approximately $6 million to $10 million of revenue after it opens later this year. Based on just these 6
states, we built up to a revenue range of about $205 million to $255 million. In addition, Jushi is constantly and continually reviewing acquisition
opportunities, talking to local partners and applying for licenses in new limited markets for further potential upside, but we don't quantify the
likelihood or include this in our revenue guidance. In addition to our 2021 revenue guidance, we provided EBITDA guidance of $40 million to $50
million or blended EBITDA margin of about 20% across the year.

At the end of this year, Q4, we'll probably be in the range of the mid- to high single digits EBITDA margin as we open up new business lines, that
in Q1 will increase to the low double digits, and it'll be a step function throughout the year increase into the mid- to high 20s and certain business
lines could have EBITDA margins above 30% by the end of the year.

Thank you for your time, and thanks for listening. I'd now like to introduce Jushi's Chairman and CEO, Jim Cacioppo.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Kim and John. My name is Jim Cacioppo. Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Jushi. The strategy around which states we get into and
what part of the vertical integration process we do first is the key to our building a great licensed portfolio. This allows us to be present in the best
areas, and create the most value with the capital we have at hand, which is always what we think about first is shareholders.

We went to Pennsylvania with our biggest capital investment to date and have made great moves in both Illinois and Virginia. Our capital allocation
decisions are strong. It's really that simple, buying in good states, retail first and some (inaudible) execution.

This is how we've trained with our big finance skills that we obtained in hedge funds, distressed investing and private equity. Our leadership team,
Erich Mauff, John and myself developed financial and operating models to generate good data-driven decisions that we can manage the business
to. These models help us so we don't run out of cash, like a lot of companies have.

We anticipate our cash needs ahead of time, and we manage to those needs. We've successfully integrated and operated what we've acquired.
We are one of the only companies, maybe the only company that I'm aware of that bought a great operating day. The team out of Colorado, called
the clinic had already opened 13 best-in-class grower process facilities and many retail locations since they started in this business in about 2009.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Most importantly, they have experience. They understand all the standard operating procedures needed. They understand the genetics. They
understand how to grow. They have recipes and formulas in place for all of that. They've seen things work and they've seen things fail. That was
just a pure IP and talent acquisition, period.

I don't know if anyone else who actually did that. It was key to recognize our soft spots in management. We anticipated the need for a strong
corporate structure early on. We brought on a great CFO, a great legal team, and a fabulous Human Resource department, so we have all the
functions and processes in place that make a great company.

With that in mind, we were able to focus fully on our capital allocation decisions. To supplement this great team, we brought on a COO of Jushi
Europe, who's an extremely experienced operator in cultivation out of Organigram, where he had done indoor cultivation at huge scale, probably
the biggest and most successful grower in the world. It's about 450,000 to 500,000 square feet that he engineered and managed. So we complemented
the Denver team with somebody who had done it on massive scale. We really had to go to Canada to find that person since that scale had not
really been achieved in a successful way in the U.S. Then we integrated our digital team, and we relaunched BEYOND-HELLO.com with online
preordering, express and curbside pickup.

This was extremely fortunate timing. This really empowered us during COVID to help drive our numbers beginning in late April and throughout
summer of 2020. I think about 70% of our transactions right now are occurring online, or more. I for one have been super surprised how much an
effect it really has. We're not resting on any successes or laurels that we have had.

Senior management like myself, Erich and John, were hands on, we're focused, we're improving our retail operations every day right now. We've
already reduced costs in our Pennsylvanian retail system by 40% and we are driving revenue growth to an industry-leading 70% to 80%. That's
right now.

This is just by identifying the long hanging fruit and executing on that. Now we're at the point where we need to establish more sophisticated
retail management to work on more subtle things. We recently hired a great team with cannabis and other retail experiences to take advantage
of the current fragile job market and to support our growth.

We are also currently building out a strategic commercial operation, to sell our cultivated product in the wholesale market in Pennsylvania, Nevada
and Virginia. This team also procures our products for our retail network in all states. Our goal is to provide a full menu, not just of our own brands
but other leading brands. Well stocked shelves drive customer low and increases the purchase size. Customers always go where they have the
most choice of available products and where things are price dependent.

Inventory procurement is very important. So it's also a constant focus of our senior management team of Erich, John and myself. Our strong balance
sheet allows us to pay wholesalers early or on time. We're best-in-class customers. We are building super strong relationships with these wholesalers
to drive a competitive menu, at competitive prices for our patients and customers. Being a multi-state buyer helps us with large multistate sellers.

This is part of our rationale for being retail-only in California. The big wholesalers appreciate our loyalty in a more competitive state like California,
and they reward us in a more supply-constrained state like Illinois. We've built the business in this progression. And as a result, we have an
industry-leading platform of management in place. We don't have to add significant corporate staff to manage additional bolt-on acquisitions in
our existing states or in a new state, if we decide to enter one. We haven't put this overhead in too soon. We haven't had to have large cost cutbacks
related to that. It was well-timed in a progressive, thoughtful way. We're very proud of that.

The large corporate, general and administrative overhead may appear first as a liability. But in reality, it's an asset because you can't really manage
a business without a strong platform. The industry has seen many management failures. By building a strong management platform, we have
created a cohesive and motivated team. Voluntary turnover has been extremely low. Everybody owns a significant amount of stock, so we have
one big focus, and that's shareholder returns.

I really think you're seeing it all come together, and we're clearly at an inflection point. We expect the business to be EBITDA positive in the fourth
quarter and are on our way to being operating cash flow positive in the not-too-distant future.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And this has been the most important first milestone. For me, that goal is paramount, and we're getting there really according to very early plans.
We've managed all this through pretty volatile cannabis capital markets and the capital market panic related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We raised
money in December of last year and in June and July of this year, when only a select group of companies were able to raise capital. That's an obvious
strength we've had. We have also raised substantial capital on our own without the assistance of bankers, and that's a huge competitive advantage
that we bring to the table. We're not dependent upon the usual suspects in the market.

To summarize our advantage, we have a distressed environment in the cannabis industry, where we can do highly strategic in-state bolt-on
acquisitions that leverage the existing corporate platform without any material management additions.

There's good value in this environment where financing is very tight. Our public company platform stands out to sellers as the one with the best
core group of states and the best management team. Our management team, as a group, are the largest holders of common stock in the company.
The management team and founders have invested about $45 million of a total of $225 million of capital raised in just over 2.5 years. We have
been eating our own cooking as they say, from day 1, and we continue to invest in the company.

In terms of supply and demand for cannabis assets, I believe there are many great assets for sale. And we are just finding sellers getting more
realistic and some have pressure to sell. You saw that in our last acquisition of Pennsylvania. We bought a great grower processor, and we closed
that in August.

Certain large public MSOs, best alternative to raise capital is to sell assets. We're taking advantage of that. In addition, private sellers, in some cases,
have been waiting several years to sell. They realize how difficult it is to sell after over a year of the market being virtually closed for them. Very few
people can raise money and execute on a successful purchase and have the credibility to do so. We have proved that we are in that category. Some
of the best position acquirers are full capacity in the states we are targeting, further limiting competitive dynamics for the sellers. Those are the
ones we can create a win-win scenario with. Deals throughout the country compete with one another, since capital is limited. So for example, we
can play off as a seller in a vertically integrated operation in Massachusetts against a vertical in Maryland or other vertically integrated operations
in Massachusetts or a grower processor in Illinois or several retail stores in California.

All these deals can be good for Jushi at the right price and the right mix of cash and security. And we can't do all of it. So this puts us in an extremely
strong position. Investors are doing a better job of separating the good and the bad management team and valuing the companies on a cash flow
basis. Every deal we have done has been a good deal.

And the 2 big deals we closed this year in Pennsylvania, Illinois were extraordinary deals based on the price of future cash flows. We are the only
company to announce finance and close a deal during the COVID-19 pandemic. The process took about 8 weeks after we announced the deal,
which I think is extraordinary and a real marketing point for investors and potential sellers. These sellers often highly value both certainty and
timing.

This is not talk, but this is action. This is something we've done. The Gen 1 cannabis promoters who defined the industry at 18 to 24 months ago,
are mostly long gone. The future will be charted by data-driven technocrats like us.

At this point, we have this platform that has implied growth going from about $100 million run rate or more now to, hopefully, $250 million of
revenue for the full year next year. It's all really just a question of us executing by opening stores, getting cultivation up to speed and achieving
better yields with higher potency while doing some expansions. This is not easy and requires intense focus, but this is what I call basic blocking
and tackling. We can get there.

Our business development team will take this platform on the other hand, and they will leverage it with more assets. This is harder. This requires
discipline and creativity to get the right deal done.

So switching gears. We have also carefully avoided bad strategic decisions since we think like investors and do not act like asset gatherers or
corporate managers. We haven't succumbed to pressure to enter markets that our data doesn't back up. Being a Florida-based company, we know
a lot about the state. And there was a pressure for us to be in that market. That market has proven to be great for a few companies.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 In New York, we had a minority interest in a license and decided to sell it at the right price at the right time, at a great profit. Selling our New York
license was a tremendous moment in our company's development. We sold an asset when everybody else was buying. We chose to sell against
the trend because we recognized that finance years of the market were pushing everybody to the same states and driving up prices.

Other states looked much more attractive with better competitive structures, and we're just a year or 2 behind Florida and the prices were better.
New York was a dream based on very limited number of licenses, 10, combined with high population, about 21 million people and a very high
income levels with no consideration being paid for the difficult operating environment created by the state government and the very strong holistic
markets in New York City or the extremely high cost of operating stores in New York City. We were the leaders in New York, not the followers.

A lot of companies that are in trouble now were followers in that regard. In addition, we've been able to use those proceeds and profit to drive
value for our shareholders in more economic states. So in summary, the Vireo deal, our Pennsylvania grower processor. We were the only people
who were able to announce finance and close a deal during COVID-19 pandemic. Was it great price? Illinois, a deck deal in Colorado, resulting in
an acquisition in Illinois, and we have 2 stores that I believe are will be our 2 best stores opening up soon. I just can't imagine doing another deal
that good, but I'm very proud of that. As a result, it turned into the fabulous acquisition of our now super successful Illinois stores. In New York, we
sold in opportune time. The only public company that I know that sold a significant asset. The result is that we now have 2 of the 3 best markets
with Pennsylvania and Illinois.

And Virginia -- as I always say, I'll compare Virginia to any other company's best third state. In many states like New York, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts
and Maryland, the biggest companies just don't have the regulatory ability to buy assets, and they're the ones with the best balance sheets and
the most capabilities.

And there are 3 or 4 smaller companies, including ourselves, that can buy. Of this small group, we probably have the most experienced and most
successful acquisition team based on our track record. We haven't had any large-scale deals that we've had to pull out of. We haven't paid any
break fees or we haven't had any big strategic failures like in New York. We also have, in my opinion, the best corporate management structure.

And we also have a very, very strong, very integrated operating team that can run grower processors and stores throughout the country. I think
we're the one company that's on plan. And we just keep chugging ahead slowly but surely, like the slow but wise tortoise. A lot of rabbits have not
survived. They've been run over by the freight train called a volatile cannabis market.

Jushi has the highest growth rate in the sector and arguably one of the best management teams in this sized market cap. There was this misconception
in the industry when we went public that the winners were already established. There were 6 national flyers already there, which were MedMen,
Harvest, Acreage, Curaleaf, Cresco and GTI. And there was no room for anyone else, this theory went.

I heard this time and time again. The theory was that there's going to be only 5 or 6 winners at the end of the day, and they all were there and no
one could catch up. Well, as it turns out, 3 of those already disappeared as dominant, big companies. Those 3 have all been sellers and are on a
constant state of restructuring.

So you only have 3 larger public MSOs that are healthy players right now. And I always said, I think the 5 could be 10. And I also said that I didn't
think that the companies that everyone thought were so big and strong were going to remain that way. This promoter attitude hurt the industry.
However, investors have been reassessing and watching patiently for well over a year now.

It could be the right time for a more material resurgence for the survivors. As an industry, it's very, very difficult to recover from that. So I think
there's very open playing field to execute on right now with a lot of distressed values and a lot of opportunities for people like ourselves. Additionally,
if you look at the regulatory scene, it's kind of like the prohibition in the 1930s on alcohol.

The end of cannabis prohibition will likely continue to be a slow process as the federal ban is lifted on the cannabis in phases. First, we know that
states do medical as they have, then they do adult use. Some federal laws will loosen like banking and maybe tax regime. Then maybe the state
rights and before we get to de-scheduling. What's great about the legal market, it's that you're taking away the illicit market and turning it into a
taxable legal one, and there are great medical uses and societal wrongs being righted.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 On top of that, the market is growing. There are so many people out there like the baby boom generation who are using products for all kinds of
things. They're using them for medical uses like PTSD, pain, anxiety, migraine headaches and sleep. And the products are getting better and better.
Patients are getting more educated. It's the ultimate customized medicine where you can find the right solution for yourself, go slow with small
doses and reduce the risk of a bad experience.

The new trend is micro dosing, fast-acting edibles and delivery systems that don't involve smoking or vaping, but still provide the quick effect.
There are products like tinctures or fast dissolves and better patches and improved absorption creams. In both medical and adult-use markets,
these products are safer alternatives to the opioids and other pills that are widely recognized as addictive for most people. What really attracted
me to cannabis is that it's a natural product. If you speak to a pain management doctor, and you should, the first thing they'll say they like about
it is that they know when they prescribe it, it doesn't kill people.

When they prescribe opioids, they don't feel that way. They feel like they're taking a risk, a moral risk, a financial risk, all kinds of risks, and they don't
like doing that anymore. Cannabis, well, it just fits seamlessly into the greening of society, which is obviously a huge trend that we're involved in.

And so the trends for this product couldn't be better. In terms of the popularity of it, we're in election year, it's a good time to talk about elections.
So take a look at the swing states and their relationship to cannabis. The American people clearly want legal cannabis. That is the best indicator.
We are democracy and the people will always win eventually. There's just really no turning back. Federal illegality will go away. It's hard to predict
exactly when, of course, but it's just a question of time.

The industry is great. And Jushi is a small-cap stock that is perfectly positioned with a focused, hard-working management team with very significant
invested capital on the line. Thanks very much for joining us.

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
I'm Ryan Cook. I'm Executive Vice President of Operations for Jushi. My cannabis career started quite some time ago. I've had an opportunity be a
part of the movement really since back in 2001. I started my career in Colorado. Colorado was an exciting opportunity for the cannabis industry as
a whole. I spent a lot of the beginning parts of my career in the state capital and really working to develop testing, employee safety, complete
regulations surrounding extraction and cultivation. And a lot of those theories and concepts that we created in Colorado ended up being adopted
across the country.

Kim Eastman
My name is Kim Eastman. I am the Vice President of Manufacturing for Jushi. I think as more states are coming online from the medical cannabis
perspective, we're starting to see a lot more innovation in terms of products. It's almost like going through the industrial revolution in 3 years.
There's no other time that we're going to be afforded this kind of opportunity. Cannabis is unique. A lot of companies -- they're agricultural or their
retail. We are all of those things. Cultivation and manufacturing speak regularly. Josh Malman and I have such a good relationship over the past
almost decade of working together. We understand that everything that he puts on that plant ultimately affects the products I make.

Josh Malman
My name is Josh Malman. I'm the Vice President of Cultivation for Jushi. I think vertical integration in the cannabis industry just means that you
have to own all parts of the supply chain. In Colorado, in the early years, there was no wholesale market. So you were responsible for producing,
processing and selling all of your product. You had to have all 3 parts. We're actually seeing that vertical integration continue in a way that makes
sense for the facilities that we work in, for the automation equipment that we work with.

We're in an indoor situation. We have full control of our environment and our lighting and the processes. But at the end of the day, it's still this
agriculture. It's still a plant. There is a challenge there. I think our goal is to produce healthy plants, to our best of ability, grow them the same way
every time and to handle them the same way every time to get to that most consistent product at the end of the day.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Flower is a challenge, and consumers do want to come to the store and get that same public cush or sour diesel every single time. And when you
don't produce that same product, you definitely hear about it.

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
And in 2009, I moved forward quickly and opened my first dispensary in Colorado. So I was one of the founders of The Clinic. The Clinic eventually
converted into The Clinic, The Lab and The Bank, 3 independent brands that were doing 3 completely different things in the cannabis industry.
The Bank being a genetics company. The genetics have been an important piece to us. We've had the ability to develop larger breeding programs,
very exciting when popping seeds that whether you're going to pop 5 or 10 seeds, you'll get a much better genetic variety when doing 100 or say
1,000.

Kim Eastman
We would sell cloves. That was a big, big thing for The Bank side and the genetic side as people could come in, in the spring, pick up their cloves.

Josh Malman
When you go into these facilities, that's a huge area of focus is how do the plants get harvested and how do they get processed towards the
packaging? And how can we improve that area to ensure that we're packaging a product that's as close to what that living plant was prior to it
being harvested?

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
And I think that, that has allowed us to really find incredible strains that are hardy, that have incredible disease resistance and larger yields. The
way that I look at it is that champions brew champions. And so we've spent a lot of time in finding the perfect genetics.

Actually, we were the first organization awarded for a CBD strain through High Times and the cannabis Cup. Then I moved into The Lab, which is
our extraction and processing division. And so The Lab is a great organization that ultimately popped up through really innovation and technology.

Kim Eastman
The Lab itself has always been a focused brand for concentrated products, specifically targeted for consumers that actually value the strain specificity
that's going to come with the concentrate. And so we're going to be able to put out highly medicated products that are highly potent. That's been
the focus for The Lab, and we launched live resin vape cartridges and then from there high terpene extract cartridges and just have seen a lot of
developments in the technology behind the vape.

Josh Malman
We've continued to look at our extraction methods as well as refinement methods and see if there were ways, technologies, concepts, methodologies
that we could utilize to be able to push that product forward. And I think live resin was really a huge advancement in extracted products. Live resin
is an incredible product that ultimately retains all of the great qualities of the cannabis strain.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
Cannabis is a short day plant, meaning it needs less than 12 hours a daylight or artificial light in order to force it to flower. So anything over 12
hours would generally keep the plant growing vegetatively, which is growing roots, growing the top of the plant, but not ever putting out the
flowers or where the medicine is contained.

Josh Malman
From the point that you harvest that plant, as soon as you cut the stock, you've got about 4 hours until degradation starts. And you can have an
incredible cultivator, but if you don't understand the concepts post harvest, you can really cause some problems there for the quality of the product.
The process of creating live resin extracted products is ultimately immediately post harvest. We take a fresh plant and extract that through a
hydrocarbon process without destroying any of the terpenes or cannabinoids that are most characteristic of the plant.

The incredible flavor, aroma and ultimately effect through different cannabinoids and terpenes is the reason why we use live resin process. So we
were the first company ever awarded by High Times for live resin product. So I had 8 cultivations under my belt, 5 manufacturing facilities and 10
dispensaries by the time that I had come on to Jushi. So it was pretty exciting to be able to utilize the knowledge that I had created there and jump
right into a couple of acquisitions that the Jushi organization had made.

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
It's fun to bill in these facilities and walked out after an hour and have a list of opportunities that you can come in there and make very simple, easy
changes and increase their productivity or increase their efficiency in those -- in their buildings.

Josh Malman
So we've spent a lot of time with the team there, really, again, learning from them and then implementing our policies and concepts and processes.
And I think a lot of that really helps from an efficiency standpoint. We've put in quite a bit of automation. We've increased yields by almost 15%,
which is an incredible -- I think anyone in agriculture would tell you that you can increase yields that significantly, you're doing something right.

Kim Eastman
It's really looking long term, what the master plan is. It's like a puzzle. Like all right, well, we're going to use these 2 rooms, make sure the space is
big enough with ultimately the goal of popping the top or moving.

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
It's exciting for me and my team to be able to go in there, evaluate, audit and then start to implement new technologies and concepts that we've
been very successful at across the country. We look at technology across the board when we walk into these facilities from vertical cultivation
systems, to the lighting technologies, to watering and fertigation systems. And I think each of those areas have -- are very crucial in being able to
develop a great product.

So what our team understands through years of experience in cultivating products is that we understand those pain points. We can immediately
go in, identify it, and ultimately tell you the technologies that will help to benefit that product.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Josh Malman
The takeover of the clinic by Jushi was -- I think those of us that came over to the Jushi team, we're excited about the opportunity to work with a
larger company to be able to take all the knowledge that we've built over the last 10 years and then start to use that to really grow into the industry
throughout the nation.

Ryan Cook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Operations
It's all about developing additional concepts and technologies to be able to take us into the future.

Blythe Huestis
My name is Blythe Huestis. I'm the Vice President of Customer Experience for Jushi. So when we're designing stores, we are preplanning for an
adult-use market. We make sure that if a state, for instance, requires that we have a consult room that it's along where our other points of sale are,
so we can quickly remove that wall and bring additional points of sale onto the sales floor.

We're thinking about these different sales opportunities that we could have. Do they want an express pickup? Are we going to have a kiosk? Are
we going to be delivering product? So whenever we're building out a space, we're trying to really think forward of what that particular market will
need in the future.

We've utilized the data that we're collecting from our online ordering, for instance, or from our points sale, pulling the data and understanding
what purchasing decisions people are making and why. And with that information, we're able to make sure we've got the right products on our
shelves. And it varies depending on which store we're at.

So now we are really curtailing every single product that we bring in based on the data we've collected and what our customers and patients
specifically want. Through the data, we've actually identified that about 70% of the people who come into our locations have already decided
which products they're going to pick up.

When we're opening a new store, it's important that BEYOND/HELLO never just, like, slides in under the radar. We're trying to have very open,
honest dialogue with our customers, with our patients, with the medical professionals and the communities with which we serve. Part of our job
has always been to create this healthy, happy environment that people want to be in.

You first have to start with the right people and it's setting the expectation that we have of all of our staff members from the very first interaction.
And through the hiring process, the orientation and the onboarding process, it's making sure that they have a very clear vision of what our mission
is, and they have to buy into it and they have to believe in it. And as long as we've got those right people, the spirit of BEYOND/HELLO is going to
continue regardless of what market you're in.

When you're walking in to speak with the customer consultant, they're totally geeking out on cannabis because they're cannabis enthusiasts. And
it's really important when somebody comes into BEYOND/HELLO that we're listening. We want to continue to educate people. For us, it's using
different words to describe the effects to really cater to what an individual is looking for. It is a great place for somebody who's an adult-use
recreational user and also for people who are going in for very serious medical conditions.

We really try and have a curated selection of products. We want the best, and we want to make sure that we're providing products for our
new-to-cannabis consumers and also our experienced cannabis consumers.

BEYOND/HELLO is incredibly scalable, very versatile and it has an opportunity really to go into so many different arms of this industry. Jushi is
incredibly well funded, and we also have the power to execute. So each state that we're in, we're positioned to expand. We're basing our decisions
right now on what the future holds for the company. The opportunities with delivery are endless, and I think we've got some really great ideas
already that I'm looking forward to bringing out to our customers.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 We can take everything that we have medically and our pharmacists and our knowledge and enthusiasm of our customer consultants and bring
beyond hello on the road for delivery. That is going to be very exciting. So really looking forward to that. I think we're getting ready to do delivery
in Pennsylvania. We'll have delivery in Virginia, and we'll have delivery in California. So really, any place where a BEYOND/HELLO retail location
goes, we're going to find a way to also bring the product directly to our customers.

We really created what we're going to continue to replicate across the country, which has this really easy workflow, super secure, very customer
friendly, very worker friendly, incredibly just efficient. It works. BEYOND/HELLO is really going to elevate people's understanding of cannabis. We're
going to step up their cannabis consumption.

Trenton Woloveck - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Commercial Director
My name is Trent Woloveck. I'm the Chief Commercial Officer of Jushi. In my role as Chief Commercial Officer at Jushi, I will be responsible for both
the wholesale and retail channels of the business.

For the wholesale channel, I'll be responsible for the sales aspects to retail customers within that market, working on them from a pricing perspective,
but also a products perspective, making sure that we deliver a standardized product and being able to provide the right type of volume for them
to service their patients and/or their customers.

And then on the vertical integration side through our retail channel, making sure that we're producing the right products and pushing through at
the lowest cost to pass that along to our patients and/or customers in each one of our markets.

The big nomenclature within the industry is once you have a license, you're going to print money. That's just not the case. There's a lot of work
that goes into standing up these vertically integrated businesses or even just a retail license. Very capital intensive, and there's no traditional lending
within the space. And so being able to raise capital is imperative for a business to succeed within the cannabis industry.

With the clinic folks and the lab and everything that we've been able to bring together on the cannabis operational side, it's allowed us to now
have that capital to be able to make the investment in the right markets, but then also be able to build-out the right facility for each one of those
markets and then transition into operations. Without the proper products and being able to provide them the right types of service, it doesn't really
matter how much money you have or how much expertise you have. It's being able to bring those 2 together to really be able to drive the business
forward.

Jushi as a whole, including myself and bringing in the right people and able to bridge those 2 gaps, I feel like that's really what I've been able to
do at Jushi and being able to speak the language and understand what you need to do to operate a successful business is something that I think
is unique within the industry. And having my medical background and being able to understand and look at large-scale distribution, supply chain
management and quite frankly, just seeing medical markets mature, seeing adult-use markets mature, being able to see into the future of what I
think new medical markets and/or new adult-use markets may look like really allow us to make strong bets on specific markets, which will allow
us to drive, I guess, accretion for our shareholders. And having Jim and Erich and Jon's background around the distressed markets and structuring
deals and looking at and trying to understand where that value lies, which markets. Bringing that all together with our ops team is something that
I think is, again, a very big differentiator for the Jushi team as a whole.

Having a strong balance sheet and being able to drive those relationships is extremely important to put the right product at the right price on our
shelves. And not only that, but have a standardized product and work with the right vendors that will be able to replicate that experience time and
time again, be able to continuously meet our demands from a product perspective and then price it correctly, so that we're not only competing
against other licensed folks, but also the black market across the country. So really being able to drive home that standardization and drive home
that pricing is imperative as we continue to push forward.

i think a unique opportunity within the cannabis space that a lot of people are missing the boat on is the collection of data. And so with us being
able to capture that data through all of our technology, both from a POS perspective, but other platforms as well and capturing that and being
able to analyze that data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, puts us in a unique perspective. A lot of these out-of-the-box systems don't quite

                                                                                                                                                                             
 understand cannabis, whereas we have a team in-house that's developing these programs. What we're going to be able to do is look at our
competitors, see what their pricing, see what they have in stock and then price to be competitive.

Jushi is in a very unique position with all the data, the resources and the technology in-house to really drive and understand what's needed from
a business perspective to gain market share and win the battle.

Olivier Blechner - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Business Development
My name is Olivier Blechner. I'm EVP and Head of Business Development at Jushi. The job is very exciting because I get to work with really subject
matter experts in all fields, and then it's our job to tie it all together and make a recommendation, does this make sense. Our team is a team of 6
people currently. There are a few people on the team that concentrate in what we call originations. They just go around looking at assets, meeting
people and being in the flow constantly, whether that's in California or Nevada or in other places. So we've now spent 2 years pretty much meeting
everybody that is looking to sell anything. So you get a lot of information coming in.

We then look at our pipeline and decide, together with senior management, these are the sort of things that are interesting for us. So once we
decide, we take something from just origination to execution. Execution then is, okay, it starts with due diligence. You actually have to kick the
tires pretty hard. The typical things that you look at are, do the contracts make sense that they entered into? You have to look at are they in regulatory
compliance? Once it passes that and it still looks financially interesting, we then continue doing all the work.

Business development really leads and shepherds that process, but it doesn't do it alone. It needs all the subject matter experts. We had some
experience in structuring things in environments that are high stakes. I'm seeing that here. You have to structure carefully. You have to make sure
things are legal. It's a start-up industry, but there's perfect product acceptance. We know people like the product.

I think making good risk decisions is extremely important, like it is in every business and having people that actually know how to run business.
Risks exist, and then you have to mitigate them, okay? How do you mitigate? You put the right people in place. You hire with right experience. You
put the right processes in place. You have compliance functions. You do all that correctly.

And then the business case to me is one of the easiest and most straightforward investment thesis that I have ever heard. So the transaction we
did in Pennsylvania, that's great. Santa Barbara, that's great. Culver City, that's great. But you don't want to do something where it's like, ""That could
be a compliance issue later on."" So having that discipline to just keep saying no, no, no until a real yes comes across.

When you're acquiring a license, you're making sure that the transfer is going to be allowed. You're making sure that you can actually operationally
build it out the way you think you're going to allow. And the bet you're making is that the program is going to be as good as you think it is and
that you're getting the market share that you think you deserve.

When we're talking to people, we have a number of things we can talk about in the meeting. We can be your supplier. We can be your customer.
We can buy you out. We can work together. I mean, there's so many ways to get a good conversation going. You have enough of these, Interesting
things will percolate. How can we work together? How can we do something together that is better for you and better for us. It's great to have
more than 1 arrow in the quiver. So every conversation that we're having is worth 2 or 3 conversations that you would otherwise have.

We're applying a lot of lessons that our team has learned here and that members of our team have learned in their previous jobs because everyone
wants to put points up on the board, but you want to put great points up on the board. We feel pretty good that our approach is going to end up
being a good one, so we want to do things that are organic, sustainable and really kind of tailored to what consumers in the market will be
demanding.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Daniel James Swasbrook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & President of Jushi Europe
My name is Daniel Swasbrook, and I'm President of Jushi Europe. It's a Swiss-based company, and we are looking to enter the medical cannabis
market in Europe. Jushi Europe started in 2018. We have spent the last 18 months or so really understanding the market.

Jushi Europe's strategy is to deliver high-quality, cost-efficient, regulatory-compliant medical cannabis in a sustainable, environmentally friendly
manner.

Olivier Blechner - Jushi Holdings Inc. - EVP of Business Development
We have contracts with distributors in Germany. We'll be looking at France. We'll be looking at Switzerland. There's just a lot of optionality. And I
wouldn't sit here and say that we know perfectly well where the future is going to go, except I can tell you that some certainty, cannabis is going
to be much bigger in 5 years in Europe than it is today. It's clearly going in this direction. Growing in places like Portugal, which is a low-cost and
great weather environment is going to turn out to be a good thing. Then as things develop, we'll continue doing what we've done here, which is
pivot to doing the right thing.

Daniel James Swasbrook - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & President of Jushi Europe
Jushi Europe's strategy has been to build from ground up. By building in a closed system, we are really able to control that environment 100%. The
one significant difference that we're doing is we call it a greenhouse, but it's really a glass house. It's enclosed. It's fully contained. So it's not your
traditional greenhouse. We're growing a pharmaceutical medicinal product. So we really need to be able to control the environment. And that's
why we chose the area we did within Portugal.

Phase I, we'll see the construction of 50,000 square feet of closed greenhouses. And then Phase II and Phase III will allow us to do an additional
150,000 square feet of closed greenhouses and potentially up to 5 hectares of outdoor cultivation.

In Phase I, the total production size would be approximately 7,000 kilos of dried flower. We're not popular with some of the other big companies
out there because we are going to change the way pharmaceutical medicines are actually seen. And we are part of that. I think that's a pretty big
deal. You actually see an end result here. You're making lives better for people. We're making a significant change to the world. I see it.

Andreas Neumann - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Creative Director
My name is Andreas Neumann, the Chief Creative Director at Jushi. I spent the last 3 decades on the forefront of advertising, branding, entertainment
and digital applications. Through proven methods, research, data and digital technologies, we have transformed how companies like Apple, IBM,
McDonald's, international hotel chains and banks think about brands and their experience.

In my role at Jushi, I'm charged with leading the company's creative vision and its entrance into the digital age. We're leveraging the power of
research, data technologies and processes that drive value, while reshaping how we think about today's current cannabis consumers.

Brands are defined by their experiences. It's what helps them to stand out, and it's on top of the list when consumers decide to be loyal to a brand.
We're working to make the lives of customers better, easier, simpler.

Our relationship with a brand is like any other. To make it work, you need an ongoing understanding of what the customers need and what makes
them happy.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Julian Scaff
My name is Julian Scaff, and I'm the Director for Experience Design at Jushi. Yes. So over the last 10 years, I think a lot of companies have come to
realize that user experience is the brand. And in fact, we've discovered that it's even broader than that. The customer experience is the brand. And
that means that as designers, we need to make sure that everything a company does is very intentional. It doesn't just include like the product
design or the service, but it's every touch point with the customer. It's how we interact with them. And it's even maybe things that are beyond our
control, but we can at least be aware of and have empathy for.

When I first started working with Jushi, we were kind of starting at ground zero. And so we really had to begin with understanding the customers.
And so started with a very heavy research phase, and we went out and interviewed lots of people and we collected survey data and looked at other
data sources and just tried to collect as much information as possible about who the customers were, what their wants and needs were, their pain
points, et cetera, et cetera.

Andreas Neumann - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Creative Director
Our process starts with research. Our team examines how consumers behave, and we observe them how they interact in their environment. We
call this the customer journey. This phase is designed to give detailed information as what consumers do, insights into consumers' digital and
analog touch points and how they interact on their journey to purchase cannabis products. Based on these observations, our team creates the
architectural blueprint of the ideal flow of events. In the tech world, we call this the interaction design. And that's our Phase II. At this point, we're
no longer blind or shooting in the dark. We have the insights. We need to develop a cohesive plan. Our goal is to have a frictionless experience for
both our customers and our employees.

Julian Scaff
Whenever you're designing a product or service or any kind of experience, you're always looking for, what we call in the design world, friction
points. And that means a point at which there's a friction between the human and the system, whatever that system is. It's a physical product or a
service or maybe a digital app or something like that. And a friction point is basically where it doesn't work way the user wants it to or it doesn't
do what they want it to do or maybe there's a malfunction and things like that. And so those are the kinds of things that we focus in on because
those are the things that draw down the user experience, that degrade it. And each time that happens, it's basically chipping into your brands and
it's less and less likely the customer will come back.

You can't really compete on products anymore. You have to compete on experience. And that includes like the visual design of the branding. It
includes like how packaging is designed and how it works. How you open containers and things like that. The taste and smell of things if they're
sort of extra sort of delightful little discoveries that the user can have. It's also like online shopping. It's the in-store experience. It's when they see
a sign driving down the street.

And so it's a million different touch points. And so as designers, we're no longer really designing individual products, we're really designing whole
ecosystems.

Andreas Neumann - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Creative Director
Great brands are a combination of promise and proof, mostly proof. You can claim a lot of things, paint a positive picture, suggest outcomes of
how the public might feel when they experience your brand. But if what you asked to buy isn't delivering value, then it's pretty quick goodbye. I'll
see you later.

Today, the brand equals the experience. And companies that don't understand that or take their time to understand their customers' needs will
be left behind.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Julian Scaff
What customers are looking for is a better experience because they know they can buy the same product at another place down the street. And
so the question is, do they get a good feeling when they walk in your front door? Do they trust your bud tenders? Do they trust the store in general?
Do they feel good about a purchase when they make a purchase? Do they like the way that we talk to them? There's all sorts of things that affect
that. And that is really what's driving the decision for a customer to choose your store and not some competitor down the road.

Andreas Neumann - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Creative Director
Today's digital consumers are now calling the shots. We're in a digital transformation that is forcing us to adapt to new marketplace realities. We
must be forward-thinking to stay a few steps ahead at all times.

Cannabis is now one of the most tech-driven industries. We believe this trend will only accelerate over the next few years. We see synergies between
physical and digital retail that continues to strengthen. Cannabis consumers expect frictionless integration of physical and digital retail experiences.
With data-driven design to help us develop and refine our brands and retail experiences, we're also creating more meaningful actionable data and
total visibility, which helps us from procurement to product design. As we implement more omni-channel strategies, we will not only strengthen
our relationship with Jushi's consumers, but also open up new revenue streams.

Today, 3 out of 4 of our customers shop or decide our products online, and 83% are on mobile devices. The relaunch of our online platform during
the pandemic beyond-hello.com features a vastly improved customer experience, real-time access to store inventory and easy-to-use online
reservations. In fact, according to recent Google listings, BEYOND/HELLO's retail chain is the #1 ranking dispensary in the state of Pennsylvania.
Since relaunching our digital platform, the volume of our online ordering and express curbside pickup has been explosive during COVID.

Julian Scaff
We have designed our menus to primarily work on mobile devices because that's where it's being used most of the time, and that's where it's useful
for customers. When you go to our menu, it detects where you are. And so it will take you to the menu of the closest store to you.

Andreas Neumann - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Chief Creative Director
In markets where it's allowed, we're getting ready-to-launch delivery, one of the most demanded services by cannabis consumers. This has incredible
potential for growth and will create a safer, more convenient journey for our patients and customers.

Since April, we've already generated more than 150,000 online pre-orders, serviced more than 50,000 new digital customers online throughout
our stores, each with an average card size of $135. We've generated 6% e-commerce conversion rate, which is 2x the retail sector average. We've
had more than 1.3 million visitors online and an average of 900 customers per day. Those numbers are only going up, and this is only our first step
in the frictionless connection of our digital and physical retail experiences.

Last but not least, let's talk about our brands, or as we call them, our private labels. With our new vertically integrated cultivation and processing
facility in Pennsylvania, our facility in Nevada and our operations in Virginia, we're looking forward to introducing Jushi's award-winning brands
which we plan to launch in all of our markets. This will not only give our brands a competitive advantage, but also help us to drive down costs for
our customers and allow us to introduce new products and innovate with ease across our product lines. As we move forward, we will continue to
leverage on these data-driven processes and proven methods, so we are able to easily scale on a brand and retail level while delivering premium
products across all levels of the cannabis and hemp ecosystem. The digital journey of cannabis has just begun.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Graeme Kreindler at Eight Capital.

Graeme Kreindler - Eight Capital, Research Division - Principal
Appreciate a very informative and thorough presentation there. I wanted to start off with a question on the Virginia market. And one of the things
mentioned in the presentation there is about patient uptake being one of the biggest factors for that market unfolding in.

With respect to where you have Virginia outlined within your 2021 guidance, I was curious if you could give us some of the puts and takes with
respect to patient uptake? What sort of things are within Jushi's control? And then what sort of things are more reliant on regulations or other
market factors that could affect that range there?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Graeme. So yes, I mean, Virginia, I've said this before on these conference calls is definitely the most difficult market to predict, for sure. It's a new
cannabis market, not unlike any brand-new cannabis market. But you're -- it's -- you don't have a lot of data to go on. What we do know in Virginia
is there's been incredible sort of patient sign-ups going on. And our website is being sort of overwhelmed with e-mails that we can't return and
get back to these patients to get them into a program.

Now we don't do that. We just direct them to where they could go, the doctors or the clinics or wherever it might be for them to get a card. So
that's one thing that we do. The second is we're doing patient outreach ourselves. Now we can't do that directly, but we try to help by being
informative through our website and other ways. So that's how we can control and impact that.

Right now, there's 5,000 current patients signed up in the state, and that's increasing every day and every week, obviously. No cannabis being sold
in the state. We anticipate that will happen in October, and we'll take deliveries and open up our retail store there in Manassas.

So I think it will be a full process and sort of figuring out where Virginia is going and if we don't hit that low end of the range, we have -- I think we
have ways to beat that. For example, I think we're conservative in Illinois. So there's ways that -- the numbers we're giving in the states, I imagine
that we will not hit the center of those ranges in any of those states, but we will -- when you add it all up, I'm very confident in the overall range.

I'm going to turn it over to Jon for more specifics.

Jon Barack
Yes. I think we're pretty conservative in our assumptions in Virginia. It's hard to say exactly the growth curve you'll see in a state that's starting at
0, but the regs are pretty favorable. The state is -- our region within the state, in particular, has a pretty sophisticated populous with a high per
capita income, who we think are very interested in participating in this market.

And so if you think about a typical medical patient spend is about $3,000 a year, at the low end of our range, $17 million of revenue, I think that's
about 6,000 patients. If you look at a well-developed medical market where you have 2% to 3% patient penetration, we have 2.5 million people in
our health service area. 2% of that would be 50,000 patients.

And I'm saying that at 6,000 patients, we hit the low end of our range. So I think there's a very good chance we'll beat that. I just can't say, as Jim
said, for certain, where in the range we'll be. Maybe we'll beat the high end of the range, who knows. But we're pretty confident that these numbers
are more than achievable.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So it appears like we're assuming we get 6,000 of the 50,000 in a low case scenario of 2%. So we're -- it's pretty conservative for the first year,
we think, and we'll see how it goes.

Graeme Kreindler - Eight Capital, Research Division - Principal
Okay. Understood. Then moving on to a question about the Illinois market. I believe earlier in the presentation, you mentioned that the Sauget
location is the highest grossing location within Jushi's network right now. And it's located strategically in an area with a lot of entertainment and
a lot of nightlife. I'm wondering the impacts of COVID-19 -- we're kind of in-between restricted environment there, some opening up. And I know
there's a lot of uncertainty around that.

But I was wondering, are you expecting that trend to continue of Sauget outperforming into 2021? Or could we see a rebalancing of where some
of your highest grossing locations are just given some of the changes in people's everyday lives and where they might congregate and things like
that?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
So I think when you talk about COVID-19 in Sauget, it's very interesting to try and figure out what it is that is happening. What we have is not
enough POS' operating, but we had to make sure the employees first felt very comfortable. So we've been conservative in sort of opening 6 feet
apart or more in the store. Now everybody is sort of getting used to the virus and other things. So we're putting Flexiglass and the standard
procedures being used in other retail outlets. And that's causing us to increase the number of POS' if. That's going on now.

The direct effect of that is we have customers who are waiting online for a very long time to get into our store who -- that's not ideal at all. 20
minutes, half an hour wait is not a good thing in retail. But it shows you how much in demand the product is.

So we're going to get the customers through the store more, and I think that's going to coincide with the increase in capacity in the wholesale
market. If you look at companies out there, the 2 or 3 or 4 largest companies, most of which are public, what you'll notice is that they have huge
scale expansions coming online in 3Q and 4Q. So what that means for us is we should have more product. Truthfully now, if we can serve more
customers, the most popular products to flower and we have trouble keeping up with that in our inventory, we do a great job. I think we do as
good a job as anybody in the state procuring product. We have great relationships with the grower-processors in the state, and I really applaud
the team for doing what we've done.

But even with our skills and our building our balance sheet to pay early or pay right on time in every case, we're up against supply constraint. That's
being alleviated in Q4 at the same time that we're adding these POS' and hopefully increasing throughput in the store. So throughput in the store
is way, way down. We limit the number, I think, 35 per hour, and we know it a number of reservations.

And so now we're increasing store hours to the max ability. We're increasing POS' and have more access to flower, I believe. So I believe there's
more growth in these stores. We haven't necessarily projected that because we are conservative, and we'll probably lose in some other areas that
we have in our projections in any event. So that's how I think about Sauget. I think there's a tremendous capability.

In terms of the new Sauget store, that's the one in the entertainment district, a smack dab in the middle of it, very close to, St. Louis. And there's
very late hours as the most entertainment district. You could stay out as long as most people can bear it. And there's initial -- there's openings
occurring in that entertainment district. Now I think it's at 25% of capacity for those restaurants and clubs, and so that is big numbers for us in that
store. And that store should open at the end of 4Q or definitely by the beginning of first Q. So there's really nice timing between the flower supply
and the opening up in the COVID. So we're -- we continue to be very bullish about our footprint in Sauget.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Graeme Kreindler - Eight Capital, Research Division - Principal
Okay. Got it. Appreciate that. And then I think that's a good segue into my next question about the increase in capacity there. Just with respect to
the Pennsylvania market, which Jushi is now vertically integrated in. But we've seen, over the past couple of weeks, some increasing competition
in that state. Some of your competitors have made acquisitions to enter into Pennsylvania. I know it's a very, very tightly supplied and dynamic
medical market right now. I was wondering if you could provide any commentary in terms of, I guess, the trade-offs there between more capacity
coming online, but also at the same time, more competition coming into that state? And how you see what that does for the competitive dynamic?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, so I'll note 2 things about that. One is the fact that these competitors that are coming on now validates our footprint. I mean, the first deal
that they're going after these big sophisticated companies, and they are big and sophisticated. The first state they'd come after, since the capital
markets have opened up and you could do deals, is in Pennsylvania. So thank you for validating our story. And we're definitely the most concentrated
place by far for Pennsylvania.

And number two to that is if you look at the prices paid for grower-processors and you could back into it, I think we're talking about 2 transactions,
I think you could back into that, what you'll see is a transaction that we got completed months before they'll get completed, occurred at a fraction
of the price of what they pay. So you can back into those numbers, and you should.

Then you could also back into what they paid on retail. And what you'll see there is the value of our retail chain and what we pay way back is a
fraction, again -- a nice low fraction of what they're paying and much better locations, by the way, given our Philadelphia and Pittsburgh dominance
in our license structure.

So we feel really, really good about the fact they're validating our story. And so getting to the capacity issue, which I think is the main thrust to your
question is that I think there's going to be a flower shortage in -- or we think, the management team thinks there's going to be a flower shortage
in PA, particularly in 4Q of this year. And if you look at our projections for 4Q, they don't ramp up as much as we'd like because, well, there's a lot
of store openings got pushed into 2021 because of COVID. I spoke about that on the last call. That's just a fact of COVID. So we should have opened
up 3, 4 stores this quarter, but that just can't happen when government officials are worried about keeping people healthy and doing what they're
doing, which I think they've done a great job in Pennsylvania.

But the flower shortage is because it's such a popular product, and our stores are ramping up week over week, month over month, like we've never
seen. i mean, it's just been tremendous. And it, quite frankly, exceeded our expectations when we bought these licenses how they're performing
at medical stores. So with the flower shortage, I think the capacity -- as a major retailer, I believe the capacity is welcome. I'm looking forward to it.
The patients like full shelves. Our stores -- I believe this is a quantitative thing, not qualitative. We are the highest-rated stores in Pennsylvania. So
people prefer to come to our stores. When we come -- open into a market that already has an existing store, we typically take market share. You
saw in this presentation just the beauty of our stores and the customer service that we provide and the online system and we talked to some of
our providers of services on the online that we've been -- it's been told to me personally that we have the best online system out there. There's
other good ones, by the way. They're not that many. Many of the retailers out there, especially the mom-and-pops and some of the smaller
companies, they still don't even believe in the pre-ordering online. It's just crazy in this day and age how you cannot believe in that.

So I believe that the capacity is a good thing for Jushi certainly in the short term. So you go a little longer and say, okay, what about 2022 because
I'm talking about 2021 primarily right now. 2022, well, we anticipate that we're going to go legal from an adult-use perspective, and then it's
complete shortage of flower and other products. So we believe the run -- it will be perennially in short supply in Pennsylvania for several years as
it has been in Illinois right now. So just look at what's going on in Illinois for the grower-processors. Take that model, let's say, Pennsylvania will
have a very, very similar sort of process. So I don't actually worry at all about the increased competition. As a retailer with 15 stores and potentially
going to 18 stores if we can get regulatory approval, we would absolutely welcome more full shelves.

Your next question comes from Russell Stanley at Beacon Securities.

Russell Stanley - Beacon Securities Limited, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
Congrats on the event. Maybe if I could just follow-up on your last point around legalization in Pennsylvania and, I guess, ask for a similar prediction
on Virginia there. I believe, during the presentation, Erich predicted flower for 2021. I guess, what are your latest thoughts on adult-use legalization
in Virginia?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, there's been some movement going on in the government in terms of discussions. I believe that's very early on, and I would also believe that
it's -- if you look at other medical programs, it's way early for Virginia to be talking about adult use.

And so I'm going to turn it over to Jon, who's really been a key in that state for us from a senior management perspective.

Jon Barack
Russell, part of the statutes that were passed in the session in Virginia in the past year required that the legislature create commissions to study
the prospect for adult use as well as the expansion of the medical program. And so those studies are ongoing right now. I think we're providing
input as a processor in the market.

And so they haven't yet been presented to the legislature or the executive. And so we'll be following closely when those presentations and the
studies are made. We are cautiously optimistic that the studies will support the development of an adult-use program.

Over time, I'm not sure and not going to place a bet as to how quickly it will happen. There's been a lot of noise at the high levels in the executive
branch in favor of an adult-use program. And obviously, given economic factors in Virginia as well as other states, taxing makes a lot of sense.

But we're happy to building out our medical capacity and want to support that market. But obviously, if and when adult use develops, that will be
a great improvement in market opportunity for us.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
And on the flower side, to answer that question, I mean, that's obviously the -- since you follow these very closely, sales tend to increase when you
-- dramatically because it's the most in-demand product. If you look at Pennsylvania, I think about 50% of our sales are in flower products and
similar in Illinois, similar in California.

So that's going to really drive sales, if that happens. And I don't -- I believe that there's obviously hurdles to that in medical markets because of the
way you consume flower in terms of smoking it and hailing it. But it certainly is an inexpensive and a very accessible way, and it's easy to dose
yourself through that and get a quick action. And there's a lot of data on that. So I think that's a logical next progression, and that would be a very
positive change to our franchise there.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Russell Stanley - Beacon Securities Limited, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
(inaudible) on Pennsylvania. You've obviously had a number of openings and still a number of planned for 2021. I'm wondering, can you provide
any color, I guess, as to what lessons you've learned on your last several openings that will inform how you handle openings in 2021 given the
growth ahead of you?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, what I've learned is they take longer unfortunately. That's -- they're more expensive. So we've definitely drilled down on our models to make
sure we understand the cost. Not that we -- I mean, it just is what it is. There's a lot of cameras. There's a lot of things needed. But I think possibly,
the biggest thing that's driving is not necessarily what we've done because we have a great formula with the highest-rated dispensary and part of
that is the physical layout and the appeal of the store. But I think what it is for us is a change in regulation combined with the change in the industry
and very much so Jushi and sort of the number of online pre-orders.

So the way we look at the business in the future is very different, and there's a dividing line, pre-COVID and post-COVID. And our digital presence
really only started in April -- the end of April, where you could pre-order. And now I believe the number is at 65%, 70% of our orders are coming
from a pre-order. And more than that actually visit the site, and we believe, already choose what they're going to purchase before they come in
the store.

So what does that mean for your store design? What that means is you need to have quick pickup and so that's express pickup. And so we've
designed for that in the past, but we're fine-tuning that and doing a better job at that now in the new retail outlets. The second is the curbside
related to COVID. It's very, very popular. In some of our stores, 30% or more is curbside. And so that is something we think is going to make a lot
of sense long term, and we hope the regulators are comfortable with that. And whether -- it's not going to end up being the toys running out. It's
going to end up being like you have in a bank, where you go to the ATM and your car, and it's going to be -- so we're designing stores and thinking
about where you put a drive-through. That's one big change. And also for the curbside, just how you service that. Maybe you have a separate vault
and a separate exit that -- so it doesn't interfere with your floor. We already do that, but we can do a better job in setting up the stores, knowing
that that's a trend that will probably stay in place.

So I think those are the biggest things we're looking at as we open up the next 7 to 10 stores in PA.

Operator
Your next question comes from (inaudible) at ATB.

Unidentified Analyst
Allow me to add my congrats to what I thought was a great presentation. If we could just drill down a little further on Pennsylvania, please. So as
we all know, highly attractive but relatively opaque market. Between yourselves, TerrAscend, Cresco, GTI and Terra, to name a few, they have some
very capable competitors with strategies that are either skewing wholesale or retail, who are all buying for or claiming leadership of the market.
How do you, as a team, both think about and define share and leadership would be, part 1 of the question? And part 2, just on the increase in
competitive intensity, how do you see the margin profile of that market evolving? And how pronounced do you think the margin compression
risk is in Pennsylvania given that competitive intensity?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Great question. So the way we look at the competition, there's lots of ways to look at it. In terms of market share on retail, the easiest thing to look
at is the number of stores you have versus other people and where those stores are located. And I do believe that we have one of the best and
probably the best footprint of stores. It's -- we have 15 under license now. We have marked on 3 more. GTI operates 18. We're not sure why they

                                                                                                                                                                             
 can operate 18 and we can't. So we believe -- we hope we can get to 18 with our current regulatory approval. And so we've brought that to attention
to people already and we plan to keep vocalizing that. And then if you look at the next largest, it's much, much smaller.

So we really have a great footprint. If you look at the prices paid for retail and you look at that, one of our competitors who just paid for retail, there's
earn-outs which -- I think, the bar's set very low on those, by the way. And if you look at the total proceeds, you could see how expensive it is to
buy retail. And these -- I believe those retails are undeveloped retails in some cases. So you have to factor in what's developed and what's undeveloped
in that acquisition. But I think the point is it's not easy to come up with those footprints. And this takes time and effort, and the sellers are well
aware of the value.

So not so easy for some of these vertical competitors to get more retail without paying up, in my view. So that's number one. In retail, I think we're
in a fabulous position. We have -- on a competitive footprint, we -- again, I'm going to say this for the third time, but I'm proud of it. We are the #1
rated retailer by the customer, and you can't just buy that. That's -- you're in the market. You're working hard on that. You've been early. You've
set that up. So that puts us in a great position. And I do believe we have one of the best online ordering systems and that's -- yes, people are playing
catch-up on that, too. So we're in a great position.

So let's flip over to the grower-processor side and -- it's a separate business really. And you look at the footprint, this one, the data is harder to see.
Right now, our footprint is a big one. It's -- for sure, it's a big one. If it's the biggest, I don't know. But it is a big one. And it's surprisingly small right
now in Pennsylvania. And I think that has to do with the fact that the industry was so capital constrained over the last 12 to 15 months and some
of the biggest competitors in Pennsylvania had huge expansions going on in Illinois. And so -- and they had other capital commitments as well on
top of that.

So I think Pennsylvania is behind the curve. I believe we're going to see a flower shortage. We happen to be in a great position. I hope we can
execute like I hope we can execute because -- that's 2 hopes. It's a double hope. Because we bought this great facility that was underutilized and
now we're driving production into this flower shortage. That could really help. When we get there in October, November, I hope, but we'll certainly
get there by December, January, February, March. So we have an in-house solution to solve that flower shortage for ourselves, and we plan to do
that.

And so that's a short-term competition, not worried about it. I actually welcome the grower-processors filling up our shelves, so we can sell more
product to customers in our top of the line -- in retail stores and our top of the line online system.

So short term, not a problem. As we further out, the market is growing. And I think in the medium term, there is just going to be a supply imbalance.
It's just there. I mean, I just would be shocked. If you measure medium term, in the next 3 to 4 years, that's going to change. Why is that? Well, the
medical market in Pennsylvania is growing quite dramatically. It's supply constrained already. And more stores are opening up and that you have
underserved populations. We have a store that we're going to open up in Pottsville, where there's no store within 30 minutes. And then, I think,
Easton is in a similar situation. There's no stores around there. And then we have one in Hazleton. There's no stores around there. And so there's
not enough stores in Philadelphia and not enough -- and Pittsburgh is a very short market in terms of number of stores. So this is going to add to
the accessibility, which is very, very important. People don't want to drive an hour, 1.5 hours to pick up their prescription.

So that -- I think that's going to grow the market in Pennsylvania. This is a guesstimate, obviously, but I think it will be one of the highest penetration
rates of any medical market. Arizona currently has that honor. And I think they made adult-use in Arizona pretty quick. But I think if you look at the
numbers in Pennsylvania, certainly, in the large states, I think we'll have the highest penetration. Why that is? I don't know. But that's the trend.

And so medically, I think in the medium term, you're going to be good. And then the adult-use prospect, given the economics of both states in the
union and given what's going on politically in Pennsylvania, I think it's a pretty good bet that adult-use happens into 2021 through the legislature
and the governor (inaudible) has already been behind this. And then you would hope that opens up in early '22 if it follows the Illinois example,
maybe 4Q '21, but we would project in '22 at some point. And so that just creates a triple demand overnight.

So I don't see how we're going to end up in a situation where competition is an issue in any time. But just to take it one step further, we are -- our
facility, we believe, we can easily do 125,000 square feet, and I hope we can get over 200,000 square feet. So we can grow with the market and

                                                                                                                                                                             
 maintain market share, and when we're going to get market share and then maintain the market share. And then on top of -- and that's just going
to generate a ton of growth for us on the grower-processor side of the business and increase our margins as we sell-through our stores, it doesn't
count the sales just increases your margins. So that's going to be tremendous for our business. And then you look at the sophistication of the big
players, which we are one versus some of the smaller players, we'll be a lower cost provider. We're going to have higher quality products. The Lab
concentrate products are award winning. They've been the most popular concentrates to my knowledge in Colorado, one of the most competitive
markets and so we're going to offer super high quality live resin, all kinds of different concentrates, super high-quality flower, price right. And so
we believe we'll be cost competitive and quality competitive.

Unidentified Analyst
That's great color. Margin profile wise. Could you just drill down or share a little more on that? Then I have one quick further question, please.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
I'll let John speak to that.

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Yes. So I don't know if you're speaking specifically about the retail margin or the grower-processor margin. I'd say the grower-processor margins,
I think, can be pretty significant given they have in a supply constrained, especially flower supply-constrained market. I think even some of our
competitors have mentioned EBITDA margins above 40% for grower-processors. We're in the middle of ramping up on an expansion, whether
we're in the 40s or in the 30s. I think those margins will be pretty significant. The retail margins are more in the 20s. The blended profile for the
business will, I think, be in the 30s, maybe the low 30s.

And as Jim said, we don't expect given the growth of the market, the expected growth of the market, we don't expect significant margin compression
anytime soon. We expect market growth and possibly market share growth for us as well.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
John, can you speak to what the margins are in a recreational market like Illinois at the retail level?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Sure, sure. Yes. So in a limited license recreational market, we've seen very significant EBITDA margins, depending on the store. And this is at the
retail level, not the grower. We've seen in Illinois, 30% to 40% plus EBITDA margins, which is -- I mean, I don't think that's sustainable over time.
You see Illinois adding stores. So that isn't long-term sustainable, but medium-term is likely in the 30s. That compares to a California or Colorado,
where you might see 20% or below, where you have unlimited license markets and competition squeezes margins away.

And it's just the fundamental difference between those types of markets.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So that's another way of saying that if Pennsylvania does go towards adult use, you would expect retail margins to increase. And I would note,
in California, the locations that we've looked at, we think are firmly in the 20% to 25% or higher range. So there is a way to even do better if you
can operate better.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Local limited license.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
The local limited license markets in California.

Unidentified Analyst
Yes. That's great, Jim. Just one quick further one for me. The regulatory landscape. New Jersey, looking to vote to legalize coming up on November
3. And that's expected to have some sort of domino effect up in the Northeast, so triggering PA, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, I think we've
dealt with PA at some length. You're opportunistic in your exit in New York. But how do you think a favorable vote in New Jersey can or will impact
sort of both competitive intensity in these markets or more specifically your go-to-market strategy in that -- in the Northeast to the extent there's
opportunity outside of what we've already touched on in NPA. Just curious to hear your thoughts on a favorable New Jersey vote as it could impact
sort of the broader market and your positioning over the next couple of years given that domino effect?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. I think, listen, I think New Jersey is projected to go adult use based upon the polling. If that happens, it clearly puts pressure on the neighboring
states for us, Pennsylvania because people will go across border to buy their products, and that's lost tax dollars, all these states have significant
-- very significant budget deficits now. And they're all effectively run by similar minded governments where they believe in the product for very
different reasons often, but they get there. And so I believe you're going to see Pennsylvania follow. And then New York, the state government has
had a tortuous process with it. But we believe it goes there and then Connecticut, and they're actually looking like a regional compact, so they all
do it together. We already have Massachusetts. So we believe it all goes.

It's just a question of timing and how that affects our business development in the -- in those areas. Well, New Jersey, we believe we're only allowed
to own one, and we have a license application that's been outstanding for a while. It's gotten delayed by COVID-19. Again, the states are very busy
with dramatic health concerns. So processing applications isn't on the top of their list in these health departments. So we have that application,
that could be a positive. But also as people get more and more licenses, we find that our competitors are already in New Jersey. So if you look at
the number of competitors with good balance sheets in New Jersey and then you look at what's left over, it's pretty good dynamics for people like
us who have a good balance sheet, a good history of operating and an attractive stock, quite frankly, for these sellers. So we could do well in New
Jersey with an acquisition. We sort of have a little bit of a list of companies that we're focused on, but we want to see our application turns out.
And then when other people win applications, that's even more because they're going to have no capital, they have no reputation. They have no
-- very often, they don't have very much human resource capacity to really do these things. So we are very excited about getting involved in New
Jersey at some point if it does go adult use.

In terms of New York, you would expect the program to expand the number of licenses, it's well discussed. You could do that research. There'll be
opportunities to get into that state. I'm very glad we haven't held on to that license and had to suffer all the operating losses that people have been
suffering, because it certainly is not the environment to lose money in cannabis in a state when it's a bit tough financial market to raise capital. So
we feel good about our strategy there. We feel like we have a nice footprint there with the DENT Neurological Institute and other things we've
done there within Hemp business. So we feel like we're somewhat connected in that state. And then the rest of those states, it's a question of supply
and demand and what price we can get. We're looking at very -- there's a lot of attractive markets to acquire in.

because I had to jump in late to the presentation, but can you just talk about what the capital needs are as far as to build out your own footprint.

you balance the two. So just a lot on that.

So I'm going to let Kim continue, but I'll just start. We put out in this press release this morning that we believe we're funded toward operating cash
flow positive, and that includes CapEx required to build out the footprint. So we don't have right now, according to our models, a need to go out
to the capital markets.

And I think that's more driven by opportunity for us. Kim, why don't you speak to our cash and whatnot.

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Sure. Glenn, as of the end of August, we had over $50 million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. We only expect to invest
about $15 million to $20 million in the second half of this year on our capital investment in the Virginia improvements to PAMS, Ohio, Santa Barbara's
opening, I think, next week. So we do have a lot of construction projects ongoing, and we fully expect that our existing balance sheet will cover
those investments in this half and take us into profitability next year.

Glenn George Mattson - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - VP of Equity Research
Great. And then maybe you just -- you did mention the -- so maybe there's some opportunistic areas for M&A. As far as Nevada goes, I would imagine
that given the trouble that, that state has had, is that one of the key spots you're looking at? And what other areas -- maybe just thinking about
the West Coast. And in the East Coast, you have this really great footprint that you're exploiting now, but you have these kind of a couple of assets
on the West Coast to maybe just think about. So talk about how you're thinking about that area?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So in terms of the West Coast, I think Nevada is a a market we're looking very closely at. And we have dialogues going on. There's many more
applications that are -- been processed for retail. There's a certain number coming online owned by independents. There are certain stores owned
by some financially distressed players. And then cultivation, there's a wide variety of opportunities in cultivation and processing. So yes, Nevada
is a state with value. And we definitely have our team there quite often to figure out if there's an opportunity that meets our standards. In California,
I think if you look at the well-capitalized players, in the industry that are public, we -- I think we have a competitive advantage based upon years
of work in California.

I would note that we haven't pulled the trigger on a lot of deals because in California, the price was too high. And so the price has come down, and
our ability to finance ourselves has improved so we anticipate more deals in California throughout the next couple of years. And the numbers seem
to meet our metrics at the moment. And then flipping back to the East, a couple of states we haven't talked about. Massachusetts, if you look at
our large wealth finance competitors, both public and private, virtually every one of them, I think, is in Massachusetts. There's about 45 or 50 licenses
in Massachusetts. So there's clearly a large number of sellers relative to buyers in a space that people struggle for expertise and capital to compete.
So that's a market that we've stayed out of and the prices have come down, and we anticipate being able to do something in that market at some
                                                                                                                                                                             
 point. And then the other market that we have looked at or relooked at, I would say, is Florida. And that's something that we're just analyzing and
trying to figure it out.

The next question comes from Chris Temple at Echelon Wealth Partners.

Unidentified Analyst
Congrats on the presentation and the solid overview of operations. Just want to ask on the margins you mentioned earlier. If I look at your guidance
for next year, it implies an EBITDA margin of about 20%. And I think you were commenting that you're currently experiencing higher margins than
that on some of your stand-alone assets. So when looking ahead to that 20%, is there perhaps upside to that figure? And where do you expect
your overall consolidated EBITDA margins to shake out?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
I'll let John -- yes. Thank you, Chris. I'll let John handle the details, but just to give you conceptually how to think about the margins is -- and John
will take you through the details. The margin -- I mean we're going to EBITDA breakeven in Q4, we think, right? So that's 0-ish or single digits.

In Q3 -- Q3 breakeven, 0-ish and then Q4 positive, so call single digits to be conservative. And then you're going to have a steady progression up.
And the reason for that is asset level EBITDA margins are within what you would imagine all the -- everybody else has, we think we're operating a
very good footprint, so probably higher on average because we have one of the better footprints. We don't have a lot of -- we don't have a bad
state to be quite frank. And then on the asset level, we have margin improvement because as you open operations and they mature your margins
increase. And then over time, your margins increase when you go to adult use. So that's the general trend. And then on top of that, we have this
large G&A. We fully built out our corporate G&A. You can't run a company without management that is very, very strong. I think a bunch of our
competitors have proven that in their struggle to exist. And so what we see is us covering that EBITDA and our margins increasing very dramatically
quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year for a period of time. John, can you get more specific, please?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Yes, yes, sure. So what this really is that the business is scaling up. And so we're going from revenue in 2 states, most of our revenue in 2 states,
Illinois and Pennsylvania to 6 states over time. And we have negative operating leverage at the margin level. And these are subscale operations.
Virginia, until we open the doors of the dispensary is just cost. There's no revenue. So it hurts margin. So what's really happening is there's a step
function in our margin throughout the course of the year. I mean, really, from now through the end of 2021, each quarter, our EBITDA margin will
improve. And by the end of 2021, it will be in the high 20s, if not low 30s if we meet our projections. And so there is upside I think, certainly, to the
normalized margin level, if not in 2021, then certainly in 2022, it's not going to be 20%.

Unidentified Analyst
That's good color. My second question would just be on the potential for home delivery in markets such as Pennsylvania. How do you think that
reshapes that market? Would you expect to see a demand bump on the back of that? And -- or do you perhaps think that it could bring in more
competition to some of the urban markets you've kind of cornered off? How are you thinking about home delivery?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Yes. So it's John. Home delivery right now in Pennsylvania is really -- it's idiosyncratic. It's a caregiver delivery model. So it's not akin to a California
or some other markets that have home delivery. So it I think also hasn't been permanentized. It was, I think, partly a COVID response. And so we're
not sure yet. Following closely, I think we're going to be testing out that model soon to see how it works. And then with the thought being that if
it becomes permanent and/or expands to a true delivery model, not just a caregiver delivery model. Then we would think that would be a good
complement to having a store base in attractive locations. But ultimately, I don't think that supplants the need for stores but is complementary.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll put a comment on delivery generally. It's a very -- it's proven to be a very, very difficult business. If you look at California, there's quite a few
companies that are bankrupt because they went into a delivery-only business centered around one large company with the technology platform.
We've diligent a ton of retailers. We've only seen a couple that actually do delivery well and have a nice margin on it and have it at 20% to 30% of
their sales coming out of delivery. So it can work in the right instance and I think you need to understand the technology, it's a highly complex
business. So I think if delivery took place, we believe you would build it off of your store base, not a different model. I think that has been debunked
at least for the next few years. Maybe there's some world in 5 years where that delivery hub works but right now, as far as I can tell, they're all
virtually bankrupt. And so if you look at being a out of store delivery, what's an advantage for us. And then what's even more of an advantage for
us I believe as a multistate operator leverage to these markets that don't currently have delivery, and I'm speaking about California right now and
Virginia, we are learning it. We are putting -- we have a task force right now that is figuring out delivery, even though we really aren't allowed to
do it yet anywhere.

We will open our Santa Barbara location in October in just a few days. And we will implement a delivery model at some point there as a beta project.
And the whole idea is to actually drive significant revenue, and significant margin for the store. So that's the kind of way to think about delivery as
a well run operator. You don't just go out there and think you can make money. Because if you just do that, you're just going to lose money. You
have to figure out the model. Where you can do it and where you can't do it and try to do it profitably each and every time you do it. The other
state where we're allowed to do delivery is in Virginia. That's fairly unique. There's not a lot of delivery models out there. And so we anticipate our
Virginia footprint, which will be centered around one store for the time being in Manassas, will be -- have a significant leverage to delivery, and
we're motivated and incentivized as to put capital behind that because we actually have a live market that we can do it profitably.

So we think we'll be on the forefront of delivery, not in the rear or in the middle of the bell curve.

The next question comes from Matt McGinley at Needham.

Matthew Robert McGinley - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Great. First, collected the prior comments on the Investor Day video, that was very comprehensive and well done, and thanks for pulling this
together. My first question is on the gross margin. You already have a -- with mostly a retail business with 50% gross margins, which is great. But
presumably, the cultivation growth that you have in vertical integration is going to push that higher but you didn't explicitly outline that as a driver
of EBITDA rate, although you did I think mentioned that it would be higher into 2021. On the plan that you outlined to build out the full asset base,
kind of what are the I guess, either the higher, low end ranges that we would expect to see in 2021? Or if that's not realistic, what's a steady state
gross margin that we should expect to see out of the company with your current plan?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
I'm going to pass it over to John and Kim.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Yes. So we didn't provide explicit gross margin guidance, so I'll just give you kind of a high level as you say, our retail gross margin as a keystone
in this business is basically 50%, and then you get margin deterioration from discounting and whatnot. At the wholesale level, it's higher. And so
the blend over time will go into the 50s, the mid -- hopefully, the high 50s and theoretically, could go into the 60s, but we're not going to guide to
that at this point.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Kim?

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. I agree with John. I think the reality is that we have too many stores and improvements or construction and progress that's going to be opening
over the course of the next 8 to 12 months. Therefore, our margins are not going to be steady state as each of those different states and facilities
come online.

Matthew Robert McGinley - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Great. And then my second question is on the funding and the cash flow. You mentioned that you expect to have about $15 million to $20 million
in total CapEx in the back half. And I don't think you gave an explicit number for 2021, but you mentioned that you'd be operating cash flow positive.
So I guess there's 2 questions on that. On the -- just to be clear on the operating -- your operating cash flow positive. That includes cash from ops
and CapEx in that free cash flow definition. And then if you can't say, explicit what the CapEx would be just because you don't have the projects
or plans exactly in place yet. What should we expect for -- on a dispensary basis? Or what would be the big buckets of CapEx that you would need
to spend on the cultivation additional phases that you could do in Pennsylvania or Virginia over time? What should we expect those projects would
cost?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Okay. So Kim will start, and then maybe John will chime in.

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So in regards to CapEx for our stores, depending on the location and the size of the store, they range anywhere from $700,000 to $1.5 million
per store. And that's really predicated on kind of tweaking the plans this year to improve our customer throughput, adding POS systems, maybe
adding larger vaults to get better curated inventory that customers want. So those are going to fluctuate a little bit. There's a lot of construction
going on in the second half of this year, including a lot of those stores in Pennsylvania. Our current capital expectations and cash use from investment
is really covered by our existing cash.

The only thing that we actually haven't estimated for next year is really if we are going to go out and look at other assets and then we relook at our
plan. But our existing operating assets and our current acquisitions that we've acquired this year, we expect to fully build those out with our existing
capital and turn those profitable.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
And let me just jump in. So as far as the expansions outside of the store base, so think further building out in Virginia or PAMs in Pennsylvania. We,
in Pennsylvania, have a sale-leaseback provider, who, we think, will be very interested in funding further expansion there. So we consider that a
non-dilutive off-balance sheet capital and which is very accretive for the equity. And in Virginia, the pace of our planned expansion will be driven
by the pace of market growth there. And so we don't need to expand in order to hit the guidance we've given. The expansion that we do or really
the further build-out of cultivation rooms, for instance, would take place if the market growth is increasing beyond what we have in the projections
or into 2022. And so we'll pace that based on -- we'll pace that expansion plan based on the market growth. And if the growth is there, it will be --
it will certainly be profitable, too, and we'll have the cash flow to fund that expansion.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, in Virginia, I just want to point out a facility like that, where we could increase capital if the market increased. So we don't project,
because we don't need to. But the facility has been built out, so the empty space already has electricity and HVAC, some of the key elements that
caused you to spend money set up so that you add incremental to that, putting in walls and then equipment and other things, I don't want to
make it sound too simple and cheap. But it is a much easier process than what we did the first time. So we overspent on Virginia to make the
expansion much easier while we keep our GMP or good manufacturing practice process in the existing facility. So we thought that through, so we
could add space without effecting our current grower operations, and then we could -- the incremental spend on each square foot is a lot lower
than the initial CapEx. So we do that kind of thing, time to time again in each facility.

We have a Las Vegas expansion funded by sale-leaseback as well that we're contemplating and in the process of executing actually. So there's all
kinds of things like that, that are in our budget that are already funded. So just to sum it up, this is a very important point to me because I said this
in the presentation. But getting operating cash flow positive as an investor is -- and a risk manager and CEO is key because now everything you do
is discretionary. So your real bet on Jushi, if you invest in us, is that we've done a great job, I think, of making sure that we haven't run short of
capital as we've also been aggressive in doing deals like this last deal with Vireo, where we did a deal when the financial markets were essentially
closed to 98% of the companies. And so we were able to do a deal, take a little bit of risk by doing that, but we've quickly got it fully financed. And
so we anticipate being able to allocate capital and take that operating cash flow strength and turn it into something where we can grow by
acquisition because of the confidence we have in that.

Your next question comes from Jason Zandberg at PI Financial.

Jason Zandberg - PI Financial Corp., Research Division - Special Situations Analyst
And just wanted to pass along, this has been a great venue to -- you've covered a lot of ground and have been very helpful. So my question is how
important is it for you to have cultivation facilities in the Illinois market? Is that something that is important, can you have success without cultivation?
What are your thoughts on that?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
So I couldn't be more thrilled about our footprint in Illinois and the price we paid for it, quite frankly. So our margins there, John, are what right
now on an EBITDA basis?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
They're high 30s across the 2 stores, blended.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Blended high 30s, and we can open 2 more. So it's a fabulous footprint. So that's all -- I mean, that's a good as margin as we get on an integrated
basis, really. I mean that -- so it's been a tremendous way to get into the market. Would we like to own a grower-processor in Illinois? Absolutely.
Do we have to? No. And what prevented us from going out and buying one is it's really a matter of finding the right deal at the right price. But in
the meantime, we have an application in to get one. And we expect to hear back, John, when on that?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
That's delays, but hopefully, in the next I'd say, 2 or 3 months.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
And how many are they going to issue of...?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
I think it's another 40 somewhat?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Right. And these are smaller escrows. These are smaller licenses in terms of the footprint, but at a force store base, we don't need a huge one
because we want to offer our products, but we also want to have a full menu that includes all the great products in the state of Illinois by some
great companies. So it fits in beautifully if we get a craft grower. So if there's 40 new people getting applications, again, they don't have capital.
The vast majority don't have expertise. I don't see how we cannot get one at an attractive price. And it's all a question of what you pay, there's no
sense in buying one for the sake of buying one at a high price, where you don't generate the ROIs you could generate by buying things that distress
prices in another state. So we're looking at the return on invested capital. We believe that Illinois is not the prime time to be buying.

We think prices of grower-processors are headed down because of the application process. And we're in the application process, so we can actually
get one for free. So I mean it cost us a lot to do the application. This isn't cheap, but that's how we think about that.

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
But the reality is, in the meantime, Trent and his team on the procurement side have really great relationships with our suppliers in Illinois, and
they've been able to actually get really good products for our stores and our customers there. And so generally, even if we can't actually find a
good target that we want there, we have really good supplier relationships and the regulatory market favors multiple suppliers.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we're in great shape either way.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jason Zandberg - PI Financial Corp., Research Division - Special Situations Analyst
Yes. No, that's great insight. Just turning over to -- you mentioned that you are a fan of buying distressed assets in new markets. What's your
thoughts on the Canadian space given that there are a lot of distressed assets in that space? And we are seeing sales start to ramp up. Is that a
market that you have any interest in moving forward?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Less than 0.

The next question comes from Aaron Grey at Alliance Global Partners.

Aaron Thomas Grey - Alliance Global Partners, Research Division - MD & Head of Consumer Research
So I wanted to kind of dove back to California, where you guys have 2 of the retail assets. You guys briefly mentioned some of the opportunities
for increased M&A. I think you guys said you have 2 representatives in L.A. area who are specifically focused on that. So just number one, could you
provide some of the details where you said there were some things in the pipeline that were meeting the metrics that you guys have. So since you
had kind of described those metrics, whether or not there as profitable, if they're in more limited license localities or how you're kind of looking at
the state overall because it obviously varies by regions within the state? And then secondly, just how you think that competitive landscape is going
to evolve in the state as you've seen some competitors make some recent acquisitions within California as well where some MSOs seem to have
been kind of taking a step back from California and digging deeper, it seems like some might be trying to consolidate more in the state. So just on
those 2 within California would be helpful.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Okay. So yes, so California, as you said is a big state. It's the biggest cannabis market. It's the biggest cannabis market in the world. Everybody
knows that California if it was a separate country, would be like the eighth largest GDP in the world. So it's a place, I think, in the cannabis business,
that you have to be. And I believe a lot of our competitors have failed to understand the importance of it in terms of driving the cultural, the brands
and all those types of things. So we're excited about California. In terms of laying out our strategy, we actually believe our strategy is a competitive
advantage that a lot of our competitors don't understand. And so we don't like to talk about it publicly. Now we have talked about limited license
jurisdictions. And we've drilled down from there. That's actually not an original thought. But again, we pointed out how 70% of the market doesn't
allow cannabis, and then you have limited license jurisdictions. We like that setup, and then we go much deeper from there. And I would point out
a couple of things we did well. We avoided Los Angeles and San Francisco. Not that you can't have a great business in Los Angeles and San Francisco,
don't get me wrong. But there are many, many, many more licenses coming in those markets through social equity, and there's a bunch of unopened
licenses now.

And so within those city jurisdictions, of L.A. City, the city of L.A. or in San Francisco, not that we won't do anything there, but it's not kind of our
cup of tea. There's other people who might find the right thing, maybe earlier and have built some good businesses there. But coming in when
we're coming in, that's not where our focus is. But surrounding there those cities, you can get some great stuff. So we're -- Culver City is an example
of that. So we're very focused on the location of dispensaries. We're very focused on retail first. So if we do, do a cultivation and processing deal,
so we can bring out our brands, The Lab, the bank and (inaudible) and maybe some others by then. We have a base of business to flow that retail
through that. That is our own and so it wouldn't surprise me if we have, at the end of 2-year period, 10 to 20 different retail dispensaries, and we
are one of the largest in the state. It also wouldn't surprise me if we can't achieve that because the prices aren't where we would like them to be.
But our goal is to be a big player there over time. But doing investments that are high-return on investments, ROI, and you can just run those
numbers and come up with what you think it is.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So it's -- I think it's a great competitive advantage for us. It's somewhat unique to the Jushi story. I think California continues to be too maligned
by some of the East Coast companies and the Midwestern companies. And I think there could be some real money made there if you build the
right footprint.

Aaron Thomas Grey - Alliance Global Partners, Research Division - MD & Head of Consumer Research
That's super helpful. And then just my second question, it's kind of been asked in a couple of different ways for some earlier questions. But as we
think about -- when that's about cultivation and then kind of the gross margin profile between wholesale and retail. Just if you take a step back
about your footprint as you think about revenue mix between retail and wholesale and building a brand for the business on both through your
own products on wholesale and retail. How do you think about how that evolves over time and kind of the revenue mix between the 2, particularly
as you look to get into cultivation within specific states as Illinois was just asked or maybe like in California and Nevada?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean that's a very strategic question as well. And I think it's an important question. But right now, the industry is so young, and there's so
much opportunity. We actually don't have to understand that to make a lot of money for ourselves and shareholders. But we do have things that
we think it's in our models, but we don't think it's appropriate for us to talk about it because it's like Amazon talking about where things are going
to be in 3 years, you don't hear them doing that. They just quietly do it. And in some ways of creating the market. So they're not really sure where
all that is. We think we understand where that is and where we want to be. But I'll just give you a little bit of information to take away about how
we think about that. So we have been retail first. And I believe if you look at that strategy, it's played itself out. We've been doing this for 2.5 years
at Jushi or more, almost 3 years.

And I think where a lot of people went in and did everything or did cultivation first. The reason why we did that was we had a limited amount of
capital like everybody else did, and we thought retail was your point, if you did it in lended license jurisdiction like Santa Barbara, California or
Pennsylvania or Sauget in Illinois, that you had a competitive advantage in retail because people have maybe, not in my backyard thought process
going on, and they don't want to add too many dispensaries in a lot of these more conservative jurisdictions. So we believe that, that -- those light
assets have the most value and therefore, will be priced higher in the future. If you look at some of these transactions in Pennsylvania that we
recently announced, there was one in particular where they did a retail deal and a grower-processor deal, you could see the value that they're
paying for retail now and look at that and back into what you think that is. I will suppose to you that they are paying a lot more for retail than they
are for cultivation. And I think that was a smart strategy, that transaction by a very sophisticated operator, I believe we'll show you what you need
to know about how somebody who has money and has a good track record, thinks about it.

In addition, on the -- our transaction in Pennsylvania, where we bought the transaction, we bought the asset from Vireo. We believe when it's all
said and done, not factoring in a ton of expansion, but just something -- a very, very conservative expansion, we get to about 1x EBITDA. We've
said that, so I can say that again, and that's a very, very cheap multiple. I never thought I could achieve something like that or we could achieve
something like that, excuse me. And so I think that proves it up, too. I mean, the reason why that is, that grower-processor is that you can get to a
lower multiple in a market like Pennsylvania, people recognize the value of the retail. Retail is easier not to screw up, because you're opening up
a store. And then you can buy a non wholesale market, and there's more room to make mistakes. Less capital upfront. Grower-processors are highly
sophisticated. You can look at a lot of what's gone on in Canada and a lot of what's gone on throughout the U.S., a lot of people have had problems
growing. Looking -- and so for us, that we thought there will be more mistakes in grower-processor or more capital constraints and you'd be able
to pick it up cheaper.

So I think that's going to go on. And then the last thing I would say is in the way we think about it, if you have a retail network in a state, in that
scenario in the future where the world goes long cultivation. So now there's more cultivation than there is demand, which Colorado suffered from
that, Oregon suffered from that. I think we're a long way away from that in our state. California had some issues with that. Prices have all gone up
now because that's worked its way through. But in that scenario, you have to endure that for a year or 2. When you have your own network of retail,
you have your customer base built in for the -- and then you have the ability to trade with other people who are integrated saying, you take my
product, I'll take your product. So it's called downside protection. So the first thing we think about when we do an acquisition is not how much

                                                                                                                                                                             
 money we can make, but how -- what the probability of losing is and how little money can we lose. So that's how we think about vertically integrating
and how we pace that.

Your last question comes from Tom Carroll at Stansberry Research.

Thomas Allen Carroll - Stansberry Research LLC - Editor
Great presentation. I will echo that with everybody else. And thank you very much for your state-by-state revenue guidance. That is quite helpful
and insightful into the business. But if we look at those ranges, so it looks like you are quite confident in your Pennsylvania and your Illinois outlooks.
And conversely, it looks like you are somewhat less confident in Nevada and Ohio, just based on the ranges. We've heard a lot of great stuff here
today. I wonder if you could tell us, what worries you most in your Pennsylvania and Illinois markets that could cause the company to be maybe
at the lower end of those ranges? And then conversely, where could Nevada and Ohio outperform and surprise us to the upside?

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
I'm going to turn it over to John. Let me give you a small macro perspective and then turn it over to John. In Pennsylvania and Illinois, I think it's
pretty simple. I think there's only 2 factors that will cause a significant deviation from our plans. One is the timetable in opening stores. I think
there's a virtual certainty that we'll get them open sooner or later, but the timetable of that is likely one of the biggest risks. The other risk is if there's
a shortage of products, and we can't put them on our shelves. Through a variety of factors, I believe the more risk to that is in Pennsylvania, not
Illinois. Just look at some of the large companies that are public, how much supply is coming on and then these other dispensaries opening up
and you just kind of do the math, you can see that I think there's a pretty good chance that won't get that much worse. So -- and it could get better,
which will help us. So I believe those are the 2 big risk factors in those 2 states. And then the other states, the way I look at it is Ohio is a new state
still. I mean, there's not a whole lot of cannabis being sold there.

And so a new state always has more variability to -- on the upside and downside because it's a new state. And there's just the patient uptake, the
regulation, what's really going on in that state. And then Nevada, I believe, is predicated on an expansion of our facility. There's always risks in
construction and licensing. I think we'll get it done. But that's just a question of timing. But I think -- I think that's the biggest variability there. John?

Louis Jonathan Barack - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Co-President & Corporate Secretary
Yes. I actually have very little to add to that. I'd say the one other kind of delta in Pennsylvania is the grower-processor expansion. And that's not
incremental expansion. That's just the existing expansion that Vireo had -- was on the verge of completing when we took it over. And really just
executing on filling out those rooms and then just what we think has increased yield and production since we've taken it over. And so I think that
we're going to have to go through a couple of harvest cycles to really see that in the numbers.

And we have expectations based on our performance. We've seen an improvements in yield in other markets in Nevada, in our cultivation there,
which we think we can import over to Pennsylvania. And so that's in our numbers. And there's execution risk to the downside there. We don't think
it's high, but it's a possibility. And I think Jim answered the other stuff in Nevada. It's really just a question of the timing of the expansion as far as
beating or coming in at the high end of the range. And in Ohio, it's a new entrant to the market. And so it's really how much share or how quickly
do we gain share in that market.

Thomas Allen Carroll - Stansberry Research LLC - Editor
Okay. Very, very good. And then just for your last question here today, I want to ask an operational question that I've thought about for a while.
How many niche banks do you guys work with in your core markets? And if you were allowed to bank at the federal level via the Safe Banking Act

                                                                                                                                                                             
 or something else, how accretive would that be to kind of consolidate all of that? How accretive would that be to your EBITDA margins? Is that
something you guys have have looked at from a technocratic, as you guys say you are, perspective?

Kimberly Bambach - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
I've actually looked at that quite closely. We work with over 12 banks right now across the U.S. and internationally. We have -- many of them are
very cannabis friendly banks, and they have really great services, others are not as good. Coming from outside of cannabis from the technology
startup world, I do find it frustrating at times. The reality is that our banking and security service costs are quite high because of the complexity of
the regulatory issues as well as the federal versus state legality issue. I do believe that the banking reform for cannabis and allowing us to have
best-in-class working within a large national banks from a service perspective could incredibly streamline our cash flow and our operations and
where we deploy our capital much easier rather than the network that we've had to put together.

James Anthony Cacioppo - Jushi Holdings Inc. - Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. And I'll add to that. I think what Kim talked about is completely valid and very detailed and as you can tell, we manage all aspects of the
operation to a high degree of precision. But I also believe that on an operating basis, the biggest upticks will take place by allowing credit cards to
being used in dispensaries, if it was federal and ATM cards and that would -- that there's -- we have quantitative data that tells us that there's a
meaningful impact, double-digit percent impact and I don't want to get any more specific than that, off the top of my head, but we have meaningful
data on that, that, that will drive sales, not just for us, but obviously, the industry. The other big factor that would cause your overall net income
margin to go up is your cost of debt, I think, would go down quite dramatically. You are -- if you look in Massachusetts, there are banks loaning to
the industry. And I'm not sure what's behind that because we're not in Massachusetts. I'm not sure if some of these private companies have personal
guarantees or whatever it is. But they're doing it around the 6% level. And if you look at the cost of debt now, you could look at Curaleaf's deal, I
think that trades at like a yield to first call at like 11%, yield to first call, yield to worst.

And if you look at that, and if you look at getting bank debt at 6%, would bring down your cost of debt quite dramatically. And Cura, it has the
cheapest cost of debt, I would imagine. And so some people are paying dramatically more than that, mid- to high teens. So I think the cost of debt
will go way down. And I think it will be huge -- and for the industry. And we hope it happens in one way. But in the other way, if it doesn't happen,
we have an advantage in being able to buy assets from a more capital constrained industry.

So thank you very much for listening in, and I hope you learned a lot about Jushi and the industry. And Michael Perlman will be happy to answer
questions and get you to anybody in the organization, that he believes will help you get the answers to your questions. Thanks again.

our Executive Chairman, who has opening remarks for you. But just before, Chris Taylor, VP of Listings and Services at the New York Stock Exchange,
has a message to share. Thank you.

Chris Taylor
Good morning from the gallery overlooking the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. My name is Chris Taylor. I'm Global Head of Listings
at the NYSE. It is my privilege to congratulate Credicorp on 25 years of being listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We call the 2,200 companies
that are listed on the NYSE the greatest community of companies in the world. And Credicorp has been a key part of that community for the last
quarter century. From all of us, thank you again, and we look forward to another 25 years.

Luis Enrique Romero Belismelis - Credicorp Ltd. - Executive Chairman of the Board
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Credicorp Investor Day. I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. I'm very pleased to join
you today in my first opportunity since being elected as Chairman of the Board. This is a very special time for all of us as it is Credicorp's 25th
anniversary of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

My relationship with the group goes back to 1985 when I worked as a junior credit officer at BCP's New York office and later at security -- Atlantic
Security Bank in Panama City. Starting in 1991, I worked many years as CFO and then COO of the Romero companies and joined the Board of BCP
in 2009 and later Credicorp's in 2017. And since then, I have been closely involved in working with the management team to determine the strategic
direction of the organization.

Since it was established, Credicorp has had multiple accomplishments, including consolidating its position as the premier financial group in the
Peruvian economy.

Currently, Credicorp, through its subsidiaries, is the main provider of financial services for the Peruvian market. We have been successful in diversifying
our customer base and increasing substantially our presence in the retail segment. Today, Credicorp has 16.5 million clients, equal to 50% of the
population of Peru compared to less than 1 million in 1995, with a population of 24 million. Additionally, we have acquired and developed financial
subsidiaries in Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, supported by our offshore bank Atlantic Security and BCP's branches in Miami and Panama. The results,
since inception through December 2019, in terms of returns to our shareholders as well as that of our current positioning for future growth, have
been more than satisfactory.

Despite the short-term effects of COVID-19 on our profitability and our share price, Credicorp has delivered an annual total shareholder return of
11.7%. As you may recall, in 2018, we've reorganized the management of Credicorp subsidiaries into 4 lines of business, with the key goals of
improving client experience, leveraging best practices and enhancing synergistic opportunities across the group. Today, you will hear from each
of the business heads.

Earlier this year, we announced a series of initiatives to bolster our corporate governance to drive long-term stakeholder value and demonstrate
leadership in this area. These initiatives involve increasing the independence and diversification of the Board, including expanding the Board size,
adopting a more stringent definition for director independence consistent with global best practices and simplifying our Board Committee structure
to improve the independence and balance of director skills and experiences.

I'm pleased to say that today, 5 of our core 8 Board members are independent. 2 independent directors are women, and 3 of our 4 committees are
chaired by independent directors. In all, we refreshed 4 directors in 2020 and recently announced the nomination of another new candidate, Leslie
Pierce, to be elected as part of the Board expansion. His energy, strategic mindset, knowledge of the consumer and track record in building and
leading large corporations make him an excellent addition to our Board.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I'm honored to be chairing the Board of this organization today, particularly at this time of tremendous transition with the initiative that we embarked
upon a few years ago, accelerated by a new reality in the context of the global pandemic. This 25th anniversary period is a crucial time for Credicorp,
and we are reflecting on both the opportunity to build a stronger regional financial services institution while supporting our resilient economy
with a more sustainable future. To that end, we have accelerated a project we began planning at the end of last year related to integrating
sustainability at the core of our business strategy to ensure long-term stakeholder value for all.

As Walter will discuss in a moment, we are rethinking our role in society and the value we add to all the stakeholders. In addition to our continuous
effort in strengthening corporate governance, our management team is also working on efforts to incorporate social and environmental commitments
with each of the strategies.

We are well positioned to continue to capture opportunities from changing megatrends, leveraging our strategic focus and agility to adapt to new
realities. We continue to execute on strategies to enhance long-term competitiveness, delivering value creation and retain business resilience.

Finally, I would like to thank you for your trust in our Board and management team who, through their leadership and professionalism, guarantee
Credicorp's sustained growth and future success. Now I would like to introduce Walter who will tell you more about Credicorp story.

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Thank you, [Lucio]. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us on our Credicorp Day to commemorate our first 25 years. I have had
the privilege of being part of this company since its inception and have been a firsthand witness of its evolution into a dynamic, innovative and
growth-driven organization. I would like to share with you some of my thoughts and forward-looking perspective from this journey.

As most of you know, Credicorp's origin was the combination of the ownership of what were, until that time, 3 independent companies that shared
a somewhat similar shareholder and customer base. Credicorp was successfully launched with a market capitalization of slightly below $1 billion.
Initially, the 3 companies basically maintained their independent operating models, and Credicorp acted as a pure holding company, with a minimal
level of interaction and coordination among the operating journeys.

The first years were very favorable until the late '90s when Peru was severely impacted by a combination of effects, including: a world economic
crisis, which drastically reduced liquidity in emerging markets; a much needed opening up of the Peruvian economy, which created dislocations
of massive redeployment of capital and [byprocess;] and last but not least, the climatic impacts of El Nio. After this very dramatic adjustment, Peru
and Credicorp embarked upon a 20-year period of uninterrupted growth, leading us to achieve the growth rates shown in the graph.

But Credicorp not only grew in size but also in complexity. Today, we have more than 60 million customers in 4 countries, and we also have entered
new businesses, such as life insurance, health insurance, pension funds, asset management, investment banking, microfinance and health services.

We are clearly now one of the leading financial groups in the region, and we are positioned to continue to generate value for our customers,
employees, shareholders and the countries in which we operate through 4 key growth levers. These include: one, our positioning as a leading
player in an underpenetrated region; two, our ability to remain close to our customers for our expansive footprint, facilitating cross-selling
opportunities; three, the actively managed approach of our independent business lines, leveraging best practices, synergies and scale; and four,
our innovative culture and ability to replicate successes throughout the organization.

We continue to see an important growth potential based on the low levels of penetration the financial industry has in the markets in which we
operate. Peru, which continues to be our main market, has advanced this past decade but as the chart shows, continues to have potential to at
least double in size during the next 10 years. Peru is expected to grow at approximately 3% in real terms per annum. Correlations from the last
couple of years lead us to believe that launch of the financial system as a proxy to bank penetration should grow at 1.5x nominal GDP. This metric
leads us to estimate that both BCP and Mibanco should double the size of their loan portfolios during the next decade. This dynamic, coupled with
the widespread utilization of digital channels, indicates to us that the long-term profitability of both banks can be maintained. A combination of
growth and the elimination of important cost elements in our distribution should counter effects of reduction in margin and fees. While we continue
to see Peru as the focus of our growth, we are also very interested in the opportunities in Colombia, both in microfinance and in wealth management.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Each of our lines of business has made extensive efforts in becoming customer-centric, understanding our customers better and developing
processes and products that solve their needs without creating pain points. Data utilization has been key in understanding patterns and developing
solutions.

From Credicorp's perspective, we are very focused on capturing cross-selling opportunities when more than 1 line of business is involved. We
follow very closely these initiatives, some of which are outlined in this chart. Each initiative has a very ambitious targets, which are regularly reported
at Credicorp's Management Committee.

Over the past years, we have developed what we call today Credicorp's Way. This is better described as designing and putting into practice
Credicorp's operating model. We went through a very disciplined process, through which we reviewed all of our staff functions to determine which
structure is best suited for each particular staff function. Our objective was to balance, on the one hand, having structures and forums that allow
for best practices to be shared among the different units while on the other hand, watching closely not to increase bureaucracy and cost with a
centralized staff. This is a process and is continuously adjusted over time as the impact of each of these initiatives is constantly evaluated.

On the chart, you can see some of the staff functions that we have centralized under best practices in order to capture synergies or to create sectors
-- centers of excellence to facilitate the sharing of best practices on specialized topics with expert staff.

Each of our different lines of business has a very detailed working agenda tailored to the needs of the individual customers and to priorities and
situation of each unit. Later, the head of each line of business will share with you their strategy, priorities, challenges and objectives, but they all
have common objectives, which are to rapidly adjust and transform our operating models and our distribution channels in order to achieve 2
purposes: improve customer experience while capturing cost efficiencies.

2 years ago, we set up Krealo, our open innovation initiative, to be better connected to the fintech ecosystem in search of opportunities that fit
our long-term vision. Krealo aims to drive digital inclusion across Latin America as a means to achieve financial inclusion. Our goal is to increase
the size of the financial services market while upgrading Credicorp's technology and business models. To do this, Credicorp builds, invests in
partners, with start-ups that create sustainable digital businesses. Our operating model combines the discipline and efficiency of the corporate
world with the agile model of start-ups and a culture of challenging the status quo. Krealo has an independent governing body, with outside
advisers that oversees its budget and investment plans.

As you can see in the chart, we have focused on 3 themes: e-commerce, to help Peruvian businesses sell online and increase their target market;
digital consumer in Colombia and Chile, to bring banking transactional and investing to the underbanked in a cost efficient way; SME services, to
digitize collections, cash management, CRM and inventory management. The team dedicated to these initiatives has grown to 400 employees. By
the end of 2020, we have expect -- we expect to have 500,000 registered clients with $300 million of gross processing volume. We have made 6
investments and are very focused on scaling them in their respective markets. This initiative is, of course, a medium-term investment to which
Credicorp's Board has committed.

For many years, all of Credicorp's subsidiaries have had an active participation in the societies and economies in which we operate. Some of these
initiatives are shown in this chart. Nevertheless, it became apparent to us that we needed a more comprehensive approach to ESG and one in
which the initiatives are part of the everyday strategies and activities in the organization rather than initiatives developed and deployed by a specific
unit within each of the business lines.

During the last 5 months, we have worked with more than 30 leaders of 6 of our operating companies to analyze ESG-related risks and opportunities
in each of the business lines. We have identified business opportunities, which could create value and growth while generating a positive impact
in society.

At the senior management level, we have recently concluded a series of strategy design workshops and have established a very ambitious target
in this respect. We aim to make sustainability a core component of our strategy to ensure long-term competitiveness.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The 3 North Star ambitions are outlined in the chart, and there are topics that have always been close to what we are. First, we create a more
sustainable and inclusive economy. This initiative has always been a priority for BCP in that we have always focused on financial inclusion and
finding ways to increase the number of Peruvians that are part of the financial system. This initiative clearly has gained more importance with us
since our participation in microfinance. We believe that supporting SMEs and microfinance customers in their growth will be a strong positive for
Peru and Colombia and will bring the added benefit of contributing to the formalization of the economy. Going forward, we plan to reinforce our
focus on environmental-related risks within our risk management framework and to develop the related policies.

Second, improve the financial health of citizens in Peru and now in Colombia. BCP, Pacifico and, of course, Mibanco have traditionally had an active
participation in financial education, and we intend to continue with this initiative, which goes a long way in building trusted and transparent
relationships. Moreover, as you will hear from our business leaders, we are all committed to accelerating the innovation to anticipate customer
needs.

Third, empower our people to thrive. Developing our workforce has and will continue to be a priority. To successfully achieve our ambitious
transformation targets, we will need to develop a diverse and inclusive workforce to foster creativity and innovation. Moreover, as we have
communicated throughout the year, we are and will be committed to a strong governance structure and to encourage people to do the right
thing.

I'd like to refer you to this final slide of my presentation. This statement encapsulates our vision of integrating our role as future-oriented stakeholder,
focused on corporate citizens and how we plan and make our business decisions for the benefit of ensuring long-term value creation to all our
stakeholders.

I will leave you with a video that summarizes our 25-year history and our commitment and vision for the future. After that, Gianfranco Ferrari will
discuss our strategy and vision for the Universal Banking business.

(presentation)

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
Thanks, Walter. Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be with you today and have the opportunity to share with you our vision for the future.
I hope all of you are safe wherever you are today.

About 5 years ago, we started an introspective journey to be well prepared for the anticipated challenges of a changing world. At the end of this
journey, we defined BCP's newest purpose, transforming plans into reality. From that moment on, we have set our aspirations, goals and ways of
working with that purpose in our mind. We want to accompany our clients and their country as they grow, ensuring that plans become reality.

Our goal is to provide the best customer experience in Peru and to be among the most efficient financial institutions in Lat Am. While doing so,
we will make a significant positive impact in the country. To achieve these goals, we are leveraging on our solid historical competencies, which we
are reinforcing with our WOW! transformation strategy by adding new and differentiating capabilities. This includes establishing a strong focus on
customer centricity, innovation and digitalization, supported by robust data and analytics. Additionally, we're enhancing cybersecurity and
implementing an agile organization and culture.

The implementation of our WOW! culture and digital transformation has driven significant improvement in customer satisfaction across our most
important customer journeys. This has boosted customer satisfaction across all segments. And as a result, today, BCP is ranked as the best bank
among its peers in terms of (inaudible) customer satisfaction in every segment.

In the case of the Consumer segment, BCP has achieved an impressive improvement from 2017 levels. While we have made significant progress,
we are halfway through to meeting our goal of becoming the company in Peru that provides the best customer experience. Leveraging on digital
tools and channels is an important part of our strategy to achieve our purpose and objectives. The use of digital channels has dramatically increased
                                                                                                                                                                             
 over the last 4 years, with 28% of monetary transactions taking place through our digital channels as of June. At the same time, the share of digital
clients has more than doubled. This is allowing us to provide a better customer experience at a substantially lower cost.

Now I'd like to show you a brief video highlighting our focus on user experience and interaction through our digital applications.

As mentioned in the video, we are committed to proactively launch new digital products and features that allow us to continue improving our
customer experience in each of their interactions with BCP. The continued increase in digital sales has led to strong improvements in efficiency,
including achieving higher volumes and profitability per employee, along with a significant drop in unit transactional costs, as we show on the
table to the right of this slide. This has allowed us to keep our investment strategy in technology.

This strategy is paying off and has allowed us to rank among the most efficient leading banks in Latin America. However, we will continue pursuing
this journey as I am convinced that banking products are commodities. And if you are in a commodity business, you better be the lowest-cost
producer.

Our quest for innovation is paramount, as we explain in the following video.

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated an enormous stress test for our purpose, our way of working, culture and our organization overall. During
the past months, we have quickly adapted to the new normal and have continued to create value for our stakeholders.

As you will see in the next video, our accelerating investments in IT, data and analytics and fostering agile methodologies in our organization and
culture have been key enablers in this transformation process.

(presentation)

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
However, we realize that we have to do more to pursue our purpose. In alignment with Credicorp's ESG program, we have added a new set of
metrics and initiatives that will enable us to deepen our ties with all of our stakeholders, therefore ensuring a long-term sustainable strategy that
enable us to maximize the value of our purpose, transforming plans into reality.

Before turning the floor to Javier Ichazo, who will discuss our microfinance business, let me leave you with a final video that shows how we are
accelerating our initiatives to improve financial inclusion and education, achieve greater social and economic development and reflects our team's
commitment to our purpose and the well-being of citizens in the country where we operate.

 Humberto Javier Ichazo Bardales - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Microfinance
Good morning, everyone. Microfinance is a social business, 2 words that may seem contradictory but we are complementary. To success in
microfinance, you need to strike a balance between the economic and the social. At Credicorp, we are convinced that the success of our business
depend on the social development of our clients, their employees and communities. We are also aware that the growth must be guided by efficiency
and adequate risk management to ensure long-term sustainability.

Over the last 11 years, we have embarked on a path of learning and grow in the countries in which we operate. This has allowed us to consolidate
our presence while internationalizing and scaling our business model. With a loan book of over $3.5 billion, we are the leading group in microfinance
in the Americas and the second largest private microfinance bank worldwide. We provide micro loans to 2 million customers and are present in
Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. In 2019, the microfinance business unit contributed $120 million to Credicorp's net income.

Our clients are mainly entrepreneurs. They believe that success and effort go hand in hand. They are accustomed to adversity and highly resilient
that may entirely began with a small capital base from family members and grew within what we call the spiral of progress.

We have seen many success stories over the years. Our customers operate mainly in cash because their value system and payment chains are set
up this way. Our typical customer has limited financial education and lacks the resources to hire specialists. Their main sources of information are
their families or business people in the community. Thus, they greatly value the specialized advisory services and financial education we provide.

As they don't maintain savings in the formal banking system, we represent an important financial infrastructure and source of financing. These are
typically small loans. Just to give you an idea, 60% of our loans are for less than $1,400.

The following video gives you an idea of the challenge some of our clients face and how we are helping them to move forward and build better
life for themselves and their family.

(presentation)

Humberto Javier Ichazo Bardales - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Microfinance
In Peru, we are the leaders in microfinance, measured both in terms of loans as well as in number of customers. Our contribution to the country's
economic and social growth are extremely relevant.

Over the past 5 years, over the 500,000 Peruvian have accessed the financial system through our company. 1 out of 5 Peruvian that entered the
system are banked by Mibanco.

We operate in countries with significant unbanked population, which represent significant long-term potential as well as the need for financial
inclusion. In Peru, 42% of our micro business owners have yet to be banked. This gap is even greater in Colombia, where 67% of micro business
owners are still unbanked. The significant growth potential in both markets is a good match for our commitment to contribute to the financial
evolution of the people in the countries we operate in a profitable and efficient manner.

The opportunity in Colombia is to replicate the improvements we already shown we can achieve in terms of productivity, cost of risk and efficiency
at Encumbra, to new acquisitions such as Bancompartir. With this goal in mind, we have developed the Mibanco way operating model, which
allows us to transfer knowledge and execution to guarantee the continuity of our microfinance business in the region.

We have begun our process to consolidate in Colombia and are seeking to lead the market through inorganic and organic growth. This aspiration
drive the process we have undertaken to evolve from a traditional business model. At Mibanco, we have already transitioned from a purely traditional
model, which is people and office-intensive, towards a multichannel hybrid model that is driven by data and analytics. This digital hybrid model
approach allow us to become more efficient while further strengthening the relationship with our clients in this unique market segment.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 If we were to apply the traditional model, all the bars in the figure will be colored blue, indicating the need for human interaction. Currently, 26%
of our loans are granted without involving the adviser in the assessment stage, and there is still considerable potential to increase that percentage
of centralized decision-making.

In the early stages of the process, the model combines in-person and digital elements. This move toward a digital model without compromising
the sense of our business, which is our differentiated focus on customer relationship, is a significant competitive advantage.

While we have enhanced our business model, our overall strategy remains unchanged. We continue to ensure that our commercial and risk model
evolve in ways that preserve our customer-centric focus. We also have clear enablers that support our goals, such as a solid, differentiated culture
where each of our employees is engaged in contributing to developing both the bank and the communities where we operate.

We also continue to further enhance the capabilities of our credit models and technological infrastructure to support the evolution of our hybrid
model. This include supporting the growth and construction of digital channels, building cybersecurity and preventing fraud.

COVID-19 has led us to accelerate our digitalization effort by approximately 1.5 years. We have also reprioritized our strategic projects.

On the retail front, we're working on 2 areas at the same time. On one hand, we are digitalizing client bank interactions by providing our adviser
with digital tools for fieldwork. The objective is to optimize [intelligent routine,] provide access to lead for [developments] in the field and roll out
platform for digital services. On the other hand, we are accompanying our clients as they digitalize the client interaction process, beginning with
payments. This helps drive our clients' business and provides information to significantly improve our centralized assessment models. We
accomplished all of this by providing our adviser with intensive training.

Complementing our business, we have also begun to establish commercial partnerships that entail a fully digital business model. We have launched
this new model through an alliance with Uber and have started by providing microloans to the Gold drivers. This model not only expand our client
base selectively but also provide a great deal of information to expand our business with controlled risk as we see an interesting opportunity to
replicate this business model with other leading service and consumer companies.

The following video highlights this partnership.

(presentation)

Humberto Javier Ichazo Bardales - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Microfinance
The synergies Mibanco enjoys with other companies in Credicorp drive our growth and innovation. We outpaced the competition by offering
products and services that are tailor-made for our clients, including oncological coverage through Pacifico Seguros and digital solution through
Krealo, such as providing payment services through Culqi, one of the group's payment ecosystems.

As a leader in Latin America in microfinance and the second largest globally, adviser and financial inclusion is at the core of our purpose. We will
continue to pursue our goal of transforming the life of our customers, their families and the communities where we operate.

Now let me turn to Alvaro Correa, who will discuss our insurance and pensions business. Thank you so much.

Alvaro Correa Malachowski - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO and Head of Insurance & Pensions Funds, Investment Banking & Wealth Management
Thanks, Javier. Good morning, everyone. I am delighted to share with you the strategic direction of Credicorp's insurance and pensions business
for the years to come.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I want to start by stressing that the vision of this business unit is to create products, services and capabilities that will accompany people throughout
their lives, always striving to strengthen their protection and secure their well-being. This is supported by the purpose of our companies, which
aim to bring peace of mind to all our customers.

In Peru, over the years, we have secured a solid leadership position in the personal insurance categories, in life, health and property and casualty,
with over 30% market share overall. We know, though, that there is an enormous potential for growth in a market that still has low levels of
penetration, unattended segments of the population and informality levels. This is reflected in the Vida Ley and pension penetrations where more
than 80% of the population is not currently covered. A similar picture can be observed in the car, home and private health insurance categories.

In the last few years, we have seen a greater level of awareness in the need for protection. This was evidenced by the interest generated by certain
high-volume, low-ticket products, which we have successfully introduced. Moreover, the current situation has generated an even greater desire
for protection and a wider acceptance of digital channels in both insurance and pensions categories. Financial inclusion through protection is
paramount, and the journey to augment formality in the long run should facilitate this process. These opportunities are even more evident in
Bolivia where Crediseguros' bancassurance business model with BCP Bolivia has proven to be the right approach to penetrate that market.

The strategy that we have put in place to capture this growth opportunity is based on 3 axes: customer-centric innovation, a focus on Credicorp
distribution channels and digitalization for both sales and services.

The first strategic axis is geared towards customer centricity through innovation by closely understanding our market and generating products
based on the current and future needs of the population. Let me give you some examples. At Pacifico, after the introduction of the law that allows
the retrieval of over 90% of an individual's pension fund upon retirement, we developed flexible annuities, which have grown threefold since their
launch. Likewise, in a joint effort with Mibanco, we developed an oncological indemnity product that provides immediate compensation for a
cancer diagnosis that reached more than 20,000 insured clients in a year. Additionally, in 2019, we developed a new car insurance product called
Plan Kilmetros where clients pay a low fixed premium plus a variable amount based on the use of their car. This product has grown significantly in
the first few months after launching, and we are seeing increased interest during and after the pandemic lockdown.

In line with innovation, Prima has developed voluntary goal-oriented savings products where clients can contribute small amounts and keep track
of their progress until they have achieved specific targets. These are just some examples, but more opportunities lie ahead.

A second strategic axis focuses on capitalizing on the reach and capillarity provided by Credicorp channels. Currently, BCP and Mibanco have over
9 million customers, which provides a great opportunity for Pacifico to cross-sell and grow. In fact, out of those 9 million customers, only 2.1 million
have optional insurance products. To speed up this process, we decided to organize differently. Last year, we created a bancassurance tribe,
combining team members from BCP and Pacifico, all focused on generating business and products for BCP customers. This collaborative approach
ensures we are working together, aligned with the common objectives. Additionally, earlier this year, we created the first combined squad with
both Pacifico and Mibanco team members to develop ad hoc products adapted to the needs of lower-income clients. As I mentioned before,
bancassurance in Bolivia has become a successful business model, given the reach provided by BCP Bolivia channels and Crediseguros' focus on
subscription capabilities and operational efficiency.

Finally, to strengthen Pacifico's own channels, we implemented a 100% remote and digital advisory model for our more than 1,500 sales executives.
Not only have speed and productivity increased, but our sales force has been working remotely during this health crisis. In addition to that, Pacifico's
online product offering is getting broader, facilitating a seamless purchase experience for the increasingly digital customer base.

The third strategic axis is oriented around digitalization. Our industry will become increasingly digital, and we must be at the forefront of this trend.
As I mentioned before, Pacifico has been adding products to its e-commerce platform with great success. In only 2 years, our direct digital sales
have grown 14x. However, this still represents a very low percentage of total sales transactions.

Prima as well has been working on digital transactions and the use of new technologies. An example is digital facial recognition to facilitate
transactions, such as transferring pension funds. In addition, self-service capabilities in Pacifico and Prima are being implemented, digitizing our
large part of service requests, reinforcing the trend towards greater use of digital tools in a new lower-touch economy.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Digitalization is already a reality, but our intent is to fully transform products, sales and service processes and tools to provide an extraordinary
experience to our customers in the most efficient way. All these strategic axes have 3 main enablers that are crucial to succeed. First, by implementing
agility and scale, we are experiencing a real transformation in our culture and the ways in which we work, providing a much better response to
people's needs, along with greater collaboration in our organizations. Second, we are strengthening our capabilities to use data in a highly effective
way. Pacifico, BCP and Mibanco have access to highly valuable customer behavioral data that with the right analytical capabilities will allow our
companies to offer the right products to the right customers to cover their protection needs. Such information will be protected with best-in-class
digital security practices, and we will use it in the most ethical way.

And all of this is supported by our focus on efficiency. Our companies have led their industries for years as the most efficient companies and will
continue to do so. Our discipline on cost management and joint efforts between Prima and Pacifico in search for synergies will secure our success.

In summary, we strongly believe that there is a tremendous opportunity to increase the degree of protection in markets with significant
underpenetration and with a growing population. Today, we have our leading franchises in Peru and a well-positioned bancassurance business in
Bolivia. Credicorp's acquisition of Bancompartir in Colombia also points to a promising future regarding the expansion of our insurance business
into that market.

We play a key role in society in protecting the well-being of the population. Our purpose ensures that what we do benefits the people and, thereby,
our business.

Before passing it on to Eduardo, who will discuss our investment banking and wealth management business, I will leave you with a short video
that illustrates our commitment to our purpose and our aspiration. Thank you.

(presentation)

Eduardo Montero Dasso - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Investment Banking & Wealth Management
Thank you, Alvaro. Good morning. I'm pleased to share with you today the achievements we have accomplished to date as well as our plans for
the future.

Established 8 years ago, Credicorp Capital is investment bank with the Credicorp group. Resulting from the integration of 2 market leaders in Chile
and Colombia and the spin-off of the investment banking businesses at BCP, Credicorp was built, with the goal of becoming one of the leaders in
the region. This move represented a strategic response to a new competitive landscape that required a broader and more comprehensive advisory
services for our clients.

Soon after the integration process concluded, we focused on defining our regional business lines to provide a consistent value proposition for all
our clients across countries. A few years after and with the benefit of getting to know each other, we understood the importance of creating a
company vision, particularly in our case, since we were coming from 3 different companies and based in 5 countries. This entailed putting in place
an ambitious cultural program called [ALMA] that allowed us to start to work on our identity and, with that, to define our aspiration. We aspire to
be the advisory and financial services company preferred by the clients, the best talents of the region, known for its excellence, ethics and
commitment.

Building and maintaining a shared culture is a constant task that must be embedded in our day-to-day actions as an organization. After establishing
our business strategies and starting the process of building a unique culture, in 2019, we embarked in our first acquisition with the purchase of
Ultraserfinco, a financial services company in Colombia with a broker-dealer and investment adviser in the U.S. The merger concluded successfully
in June 2020. And with that, Credicorp Capital in Colombia doubled its assets under management, consolidated its leadership in capital markets
and gained a relevant presence in Medelln, Colombia's second largest city, that in addition to the possibility to build a robust capital markets and
wealth management platform in the U.S. This year, we began a profound transformation process that will involve redesigning our operational
model as well as renewing our IT platforms and capabilities, which is fundamental to continue and accelerate our growth plans.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 With operations in Chile, Peru and Colombia, we are consolidating our leadership position to 4 business lines: wealth management, asset management,
capital markets and corporate finance. Atlantic Security Bank, or ASB, is our banking operation in Panama that supports our wealth management
business, consolidates some of our capital markets trading strategies and increasingly provides its balance sheet to support our corporate finance
business line.

Credicorp Capital U.S., our Miami-based operation, is a wealth management and capital markets platform that provides direct access to and from
the U.S. market through its broker-dealer and investment adviser licenses. We are convinced that a strong presence in the U.S. is fundamental for
our value proposition in the region.

Our integrated strategy has allowed us to gain leading market positions and consolidate regional operations by transferring knowledge, best
practices and taking advantage of growth opportunities. Our business model and strategy are underscored by 3 key elements: first, client centricity
and the ability to truly understand customer needs and the capacity to deliver adequate solutions to experienced teams; second, a real local
presence, with teams on the ground with direct access to clients, markets and companies; and third, talent, which truly makes a significant difference
in a business that requires expertise, track record and, above all, trust. All of these 3 factors allow us to leverage our local knowledge, best practices
and regional reach.

Our client-centric culture is evidenced in our wealth management comprehensive value proposition where we offer our clients a broad range of
products, an expert adviser model and a multiplatform that provides access to local, regional and international markets, including the U.S. Our
customers are at the core of our advisory model, with our private bankers serving as the main point of contact that understand their needs and
bring to the conversation the required specialist. This successful and evolving model that has allowed us to capture 30% plus market share in Peru
is now fully deployed for our Chilean and Colombian clients. This rollout is driving double-digit expansion, and there is a clear opportunity to
increase our share, which is below 5% in both markets.

We recently launched our brand Vicctus, a renewed multifamily office service for the ultra-high net worth clientele of the region and led by a senior
and highly talented team. Vicctus, among other things, offers the most exclusive investment opportunities, specialized services beyond financial
and investment advisory, direct access to the U.S., to Credicorp Capital U.S. and the possibility to provide advisory within third-party platforms. We
constantly strive to improve our customer satisfaction, and we considered a fundamental for our long-term success.

Our local presence with complete teams on the ground is another key factor that drives our success in the region. Having relevant teams on the
ground allows us to remain close to our clients and provide them with our top execution capabilities. This also puts us in a strong position to
leverage our profound knowledge of the political landscape, the economies, markets and the companies in each of the countries where we operate.
This enables us to offer one of the most, if not the most, complete coverage of public companies that compose the main indices of stock markets
in Chile, Colombia and Peru where we have been consistently been recognized for the quality and depth of our research.

Our annual Credicorp Capital investor conference has become the leading venue in the Andean region. The 2020 investor conference is a fully
virtual event and the place to receive firsthand information from the main players in the financial and capital markets. Close ties, superb customer
service and a (inaudible) advisory are key in building long-lasting relations that transcend generations. To that extent, over the past 40 years, we
have built a wealth management practice and have been once again recognized as the best private banking practice in Peru by Euromoney in
2020.

Our goal is to be the best asset manager in Lat Am strategies for clients within and outside the region. Our focus is on attracting institutional clients,
and we have worked hard over the last 7 years to build a sophisticated buy side research team, hiring talent with deep knowledge in Lat Am markets,
and enhancing our investment process in order to achieve that goal.

We picked Luxembourg (inaudible) as a main platform for Lat Am funds due to its unparalleled regulatory security and global distribution footprint.
Today, we are proud to say that after 6 years, our assets under management in Luxembourg have grown by 13x, reaching $640 million among 3
funds, with a significant participation of institutional clients within the region.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The journey has not ended. We plan to continue enhancing our platform with new strategies as well as reach new pockets of funds in foreign
markets through alliances with [payment] agents in Europe and in the U.S.

In addition to our Luxembourg funds, we have also focused on establishing a platform for alternative funds. This platform includes, among others,
a $500 million joint venture infrastructure fund and a $1 billion real estate portfolio. In corporate finance, we have pioneered transactions in the
region, and we are very proud to have structured the first social and green bond offers in Peru, in line with our commitment as an organization to
foster and responsible social investments.

In addition, the trust that our clients put in our team's expertise and track record is reflected in the origination of 100% of the bond exchange
transactions in the Chilean market, an expertise that will be used to help clients in other markets. We're consistently striving to deliver outstanding
value to our clients, which is reflected in relevant and, in some cases, pioneering transactions over the years.

Last year, we embarked on one of our most ambitious projects in the past years, the redesign of our operating model to accelerate growth and
enhance value for our stakeholders. Historically, we operated in a segregated way, with a country employing different processes and distinct
technologies. This created lots of inefficiencies and complexities in running the company and hindered our ability to deliver on our promise of
outstanding customer experience in an increasingly sophisticated technological environment. This project involves the redesign of all our operations
to get standardized, scalable and automated process across all businesses, the change of our core systems of 3 of our business units plus changes
in other technological components of the company and the creation of new capabilities to better serve our customers. For example, we are
upgrading our digital onboarding capabilities, and our new data team is working to deliver data-driven insights to better serve our clients.

By 2023, we will have completely redesigned our operational model to work as 1 company with better operational control, increased collaboration
and a focus on growth and customer experience while also generating significant OpEx savings. In these first 8 years, we have focused on building
a regional organization and aligning our company behind a unique vision. Both milestones have been fundamental in consolidating and, in some
cases, advancing our leadership position in our different businesses and in the countries where we operate.

We clearly understood that to achieve our future growth ambitions, we need the right infrastructure to generate efficiencies, scale, but also improve
customer experience through digital capabilities. Focusing on customer experience is a top priority, an ongoing task and is fundamental for
long-term success. We are committed to maintaining the right environment to attract, develop and foster exceptional talent, which is a key factor
to sustainable performance.

To our talented teams, we not only provide expert advice to our clients but also serve society through various initiatives in our social responsibility
program, such as advising endowments and social impact entrepreneurs on a pro bono basis. As Credicorp Capital, we aspire to be one of the
leading investment banks of the region, but above all, to be recognized as the preferred and most trusted adviser for our clients.

Now let me pass it to Cesar Rios, who will comment on Credicorp group's financial strengths and dynamics.

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Thank you, Eduardo. Good morning, everyone. As each of our business leader has shared, we are executing strategies to enhance long-term
competitiveness, create value and maintain business resilience. Let me give you an overview of where we stand to continue capturing opportunities
by leveraging our strategic focus and agility to adapt to new realities.

Today's focus will be on medium-term dynamics, but I would like to start with a very brief macroeconomic and situational update. While the impact
of this pandemic has been severe, macro and operational indicators in Peru are pointing in the right direction. We expect sustained growth to
resume next year. GDP growth has improved consistently since hitting a low last April, and employment trends are improving. This positive trend
is also evident in transactional activity at BCP through both debit and credit cards. In this context, we expect GDP to continue recovering in coming
quarters, expanding between 8% and 10% in 2021 after an anticipated drop of approximately 12% this year.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The relief measures offered by the government, the financial system and Credicorp, in particular, are attenuating the impact of this crisis on the
financial health of both individuals and companies. Progress is reflected in the evolution of the indicator of on-time payments over installments
due during the month in course.

It is important to note that the expiration of short-term relief measures coincided with an uptick in the number of monthly payments due in the
retail portfolios at BCP and Mibanco. In the case of BCP, the indicator jumped to 91% in August from 35% in May. While at Mibanco, the indicator
recovered to 80% in August, up from 52% in May. While these are encouraging trends, we continue to take a prudent approach to provisioning
and will carefully monitor the evolution of payments and transactional behavior of our clients. In this reactivation process, we are conducting
in-depth assessment of our customer risk profiles and rapidly restarting sales in those segments that are aligned with our risk appetite while
adapting to changes in the behavior and financial situation of our clients.

Despite near-term challenges, we operate in highly underpenetrated markets that offer significant long-term opportunities to continue driving
financial inclusion. In Peru, the pandemic has underscored the importance of education and financial inclusion, the value of retirement plans and
insurance coverage and the convenience of digital payments. Moreover, it has become evident that financial inclusion is driving force in economic
development. Today, our society is more sensitive to and aware of these needs, and we believe this represents a great opportunity for Credicorp.

After the businesses resumed risk control growth, we believe that microfinance has considerable potential at the regional level. A smaller
undercapitalized players face barriers to assessing funding and represent an opportunity to expand the microfinance footprint. We also see
opportunities to continue consolidated our regional position in the investment banking and wealth management businesses. Additionally, our
innovative fintech initiatives, such Tenpo in Chile and Tyba in Colombia, provide important inroads to access opportunities in these countries.

In this unprecedented environment, the strength of our franchises has become more evident and is reflected in the growth of our customer base
and solid retention rates. In this context, we are accelerating our operational transformation to consolidate and fortify our leadership. This implies
evolving from a model that relies on solid traditional client institution relations to distribute products and services to a model that builds on existing
strengths and revs up distribution capabilities through digital and data-driven venues that are customer-centric and synergetic. This approach will
allow us to use the synergies between different business lines to increase scale and efficiency, further strengthening our payment hub capacities
with additional channels. Consequently, we will be better positioned to consolidate our market position and seize new opportunities.

As we progress in our operational transformation, we will remain resilient and flexible. We have been investing heavily in digital transformation
initiatives. Over the past few years, we have developed capabilities and future sources of income, such as Yape and Krealo while maintaining the
cost-to-income ratio under control. In fact, each of these subsidiaries has improved efficiency, with the exception of Mibanco, which materially
increased its sales force last year, resulting in a consolidated full year cost-to-income ratio that remain relatively stable. Although some sources of
income has been temporarily affected this year, Credicorp has drawn on additional capabilities to ensure long-term growth by becoming more
active in market-related activities.

We have applied several short-term cost control measures, such as reducing nonessential expenses and variable compensation, among others. At
the same time, we have ramped up operating and capital investments for our business transformation process to optimize efficiency down the
road. We are well aware that now is the time to accelerate business transformation. Going forward, each line of business must meet an ambitious
efficiency goal, which has been tailored to reflect its specific strategy.

On the income side, each business is implementing strategies to optimize income from existing portfolios, such as repricing and adopting balance
sheet structure changes as it seeks out and develops new sources of income. On the cost side, each business line is working on comprehensive
cost optimization programs, freeing up resources to invest in growth-oriented initiative while evolving its operational business models. Moreover,
we are challenging our operating models in terms of our physical distribution network, support functions, organization and IT architecture to
leverage new technologies. This requires an ongoing deeper review of the procurement process, among other key initiatives.

Integral risk management is a particular strength and a key pillar of our strategy. It has evolved in scope and sophistication but has maintained a
disciplined and conservative approach. Credicorp's risk management framework reflects a comprehensive approach to defining risk appetite that
assesses solvency, liquidity, profitability and growth, results stability and balance sheet structure. In recent years, nonfinancial risk has gained

                                                                                                                                                                             
 relevance, which is reflected in our sharper focus on cyber risk and compliance. Going forward, we plan to reinforce the focus on ESG-related risks
within our company-wide risk management framework.

Fine-tuned credit risk modeling has become increasingly important, particularly in retail banking and microfinance operations. This has been a key
element in attracting and serving new segments of clients in a profitable and sustainable way. Our income generation capacity allows us to effectively
balance our conservative approach to provisioning and strong solvency levels with growth initiatives.

Our risk management models has evolved as we leverage advanced analytics and technology, generating competitive advantages by obtaining
value from internal and external transactional data and focusing more on real-time responses. This is a key component of our strategy to reach
and efficiently serve new segments of clients while deepening relations with our current client base. We have stepped up efforts to develop core
capabilities among business units to obtain economics of scale and share skill sets.

Another foundation of Credicorp's competitive position, alongside market leadership and strong risk management, is its distinctive liquidity and
capital base. At BCP, we have developed a stable and low-cost funding base as a payment hub for individuals and companies. And this crisis has
confirmed our clients' preference for and confidence in our products and services. Although the economic value of this competitive advantage in
the current low-interest environment has attenuated, in the medium and long term, this strong base will provide considerable financial muscle to
sustain profitability.

We offer a broad range of products for cash management and investments and have become leaders in managing medium- and long-term funds
by offering different types of deposits, pension funds and insurance products and have bolstered our position in assets under management by
broadening our offer of asset classes. We are actively managing the books' increasing term transformation as platforms to seize opportunities while
maintaining short-term liquidity positions and solid RCL levels.

Our strong capacity to generate returns is what fuels our capital base. We will maintain prudent solvency levels to support growth and pursue very
focused M&A opportunities. As we navigate today's turbulent waters, we remain confident that we will continue creating value for shareholders
and stakeholders.

In the short term, our profitability dynamics are challenged by a combination of factors that are pressuring margins, fee income and cost of risk.
Low reference rates have affected short-term investments and loan profitability, in particular, and the cost of risk has been severely impacted.

Nonetheless, we are rapidly adapting and leading recovery. We expect an increase in profitability as the economic rebounds and the effects of
income loss and debt are absorbed by our clients.

In the short-term, insurance premiums are expected to decrease. On the claims front, claims in the P&C and health businesses are expected to
decrease, but the life insurance claims will increase driven by COVID-related fatalities. We see potential for loan portfolio growth of 1.5x nominal
GDP on average beginning in 2022, after the extra liquidity provided by government programs, which significantly expanded total loans in 2020
is absorbed and partially repaid in 2021.

Additionally, we expect that efforts to develop digital and data-driven capabilities together with our customer-centric approach will drive a recovery
in the retail banking and microfinance businesses, which offer higher margins. The strength of our balance sheet, coupled with a steep local currency
rate cure, will allow us to grow the investment portfolio, gradually offsetting the negative impact of low interest rate by increasing volumes.

As for nonfinancial income, this will grow less than assets due to digitalization, which will allow us to optimize our operating expenses but also
lead to a drop in commissions. Investments in recent fintech innovation such as Yape and Cocos y Lucas as well as new products and segments in
banking and insurance and wealth management are expected to generate new sources of nonfinancial income.

Bancassurance is a particular promising source of growth that combines the expertise of the insurance business with the distribution capabilities
of the bank units and new digitally-driven insights to better understand and accompany our clients. After expected credit defaults are provisioned
                                                                                                                                                                             
 mainly in 2020 and early 2021, the cost of risk should come back to previous levels in each segment. On a consolidated basis, the cost of risk will
evolve in line with an increase in the relative weight of retail.

We expect efficiency levels to improve in line with business model transformation. Financial inclusion initiatives will accelerate with increased
scalability while we play a very active role in society. The cumulative effect of these factors, combined with a solid capital base will allow us to return
to an ROE in the high teens in the vicinity of precrisis levels in the medium term.

Finally, let me close with our main messages. First, we foresee development opportunities ahead, and we are well-positioned to foster a more
sustainable and inclusive economy, capturing growth opportunities. Second, our transformation investments has been key to optimizing customer
experience and consolidating new competitive advantages. Third, we will continue to improve efficiency, demonstrating disciplined risk and capital
management. Fourth, we are empowering and developing our talent, fostering diversity, equality, values and a strong corporate governance. And
finally, fifth, we are working on placing sustainability at the core of our both our strategy and business plan execution efforts to enhance long-term
competitiveness, create value and maintain business resilience.

We are now going to take a 5-minute break. And after that, we will open the floor for Q&A.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
Thank you for your patience, everyone. Today's presentation will resume here momentarily. Thank you for your patience.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We will begin with questions submitted via the webcast and then move to live
questions. (Operator Instructions) At this time, Milagros Cigüeñas will begin with the written questions. Mrs. Cigüeñas, you may begin.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Yes. Hello again. Let me start with 2 questions from the webcast, and then we will go to the phone line. To begin, there are some questions regarding
asset quality. Let me read 2 of them, which I think summarizes the main concerns of investors.

""You mentioned on your last call, you needed until the end of September to have a better understanding of the health of the reprogram portfolio.
We also already shared the recent payment behavior of customers. Then regarding your program loan book, could you give us a bit more color on
the current risk portfolio of this client base and the expected levels of provisions we could expect for the following quarters?""

And the other question is, ""Can you please give us an update on how the restructured loans are performing? How is delinquency trends going so
far versus expectations? And what is the current thinking of the level and timing of the peak in delinquency? Cesar, I think you can answer this
question, please.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Sure. Thanks for the question. Before answering, I am going to take the opportunity to mention that we would like to focus today on strategy and
medium and long-term trends. But of course, I can update about these specific questions today. We can go in further detail in the quarter business
review in November. Regarding to the performance of the portfolio, we have reaffirmed in the aspect that we mentioned in our previous conference
call, the trends are very encouraging. As you can hear a few minutes ago, the trends are positive in terms of payment, both in BCP and Mibanco,
reaching levels of 92% in BCP, 81% in Mibanco. But we are still being conscious regarding to the portion of the portfolio that has not been due at
this month. And we are carefully monitoring this performance. We expect that the provisions in the third quarter will be lower than in the second
quarter, probably similar to the first one.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Okay. Let me read the next question. ""Also please speak to a new program proposed to a borrowers struggling with (inaudible) the payments as
(inaudible) the Finance Minister, which appears to have been created by the Central Bank and regulator. We understand there are 2 other proposals
in Congress.""

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Sure. A combination of having new members of Congress and the current economic crisis has led the Congress to produce a whole series of
initiatives with very good intention, aiming at obviously elevating the impact of the crisis on the general population. But though, the way those
initiatives were drafted will probably have produced the counter effect of what they were originally intentioned. Fortunately, the process -- through
the process of getting those laws approved, input by several groups, has been incorporated into this loss.

And by the groups, I mean, our banking regulators, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the trade groups, such as the Banking Association or
the AFP Association in the case of loss-related pension funds and some of the leading sin tax. The end results have been -- have not been bad. I
think some of those legislation that has come up, will produce the desired results. In particular, regarding this one, I would like to pass on to
Gianfranco, so he could give us his latest comments on what is currently being proposed in Congress. Gianfranco, could you help me with this?

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
Sure. Thank you, Walter. Yes. Currently, there are 2 initiatives at Congress level, but 2 different groups, 2 different committees. The executive power
has presented yesterday a third initiative, which is -- it incorporates collateral from the public -- from the government. And actually, as we speak,
there are -- the executive power is presenting, making a public presentation on this proposal. And the 3 proposals still need to be discussed within
the committees and at the Congress level. As Walter mentioned, there has been an evolution of the initial ideas as where we are today, and we
hope that the end result will be a law that will improve and -- yes, improve the facilities for debtors, that is our proposal, that is constitutional and
that banks can provide it to its customer voluntarily in order to make their payments profiles better.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Thanks, Gianfranco and Walter. Let's go with the third question. Your cost-to-income ratio was 40.8% at the end of 2019. What are your long-term
aspirations here to be the best in LatAm or best in emerging markets? What is achievable by 2030, 25% or better? I think the (inaudible) half year,
please.

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Yes. Very interesting question. Thank you. I think at BCP level, these mid-teens are challenging but achievable. But at BCP credit card level, I will
think a little bit above that due to the combination of the business -- different business lines. For example, micro finance can be probably in the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 mid or high 40s, investment banking in mid-60s. And the combination of this and some corporate expenses will make that the achievable level for
Credicorp is going to be a little bit above what will be the target for universal bank like BCP. So a little bit above the figures that we have mentioned
being challenging but achievable in the medium term.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Thank you, Cesar. I think we can now go to the phone line questions. Go ahead, sir.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Thiago Batista with USB.

Thiago Bovolenta Batista - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - LatAm Equity Research Analyst of Banks
It's Thiago Batista from UBS. I have a couple of questions on the micro-finance business. The first one is, if you believe that it's possible to really
move this micro-finance business to a kind of digital platform? You guys mentioned in the presentation that most of the transactions in this segment
is in cash. If it's really feasible to move strongly to the digital channels in this segment? And another point here in the microfinance, if you believe
that Mibanco can resume to have an ROE of, let's say, 20, 28-plus as the bank presented in the last few years? And my final one, if I can. Just one is
more follow-up about the guidance. Only double check if I got the right message on the margins. Is it possible to say that the bank is expecting a
pressure in the loan margins in coming years, but the shift in the loan mix towards the retail business can support somehow the bank's margins in
the end?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Okay. Thank you. I think I'll let Javier tackle the first questions regarding microfinance, and I'll help with the translation. And then, Cesar, you can
probably take the last portion of the question. So Javier, please, back to you.

Humberto Javier Ichazo Bardales - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Microfinance
Okay. (foreign language)

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
[Interpreted] Okay. So basically, yes, the answer, we can get to pre-COVID returns in the microfinance business. Through this crisis, what we have
seen is an accelerated adoption of digital channels through customers of Mibanco that traditionally were not big users of digital channels. So we
think that we have the possibility to scale up and accelerate our digital transformation that will allow us to grow with a more efficient infrastructure
base. We are confident that this can be achieved probably in -- by 2022.

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Okay. Probably, I continue with the margin question. Thiago, you are right. We are going to suffer pressure on margins -- already are suffering the
pressure of margins due to the change in reference rate and LIBOR. This impacts directly our liquidity investments that have a decrease the
profitability in the short term. But in the medium term, the dynamics are going to be more influenced by the change in the composition of BCP
going from a more corporate and middle market to a more retail and going down in specific sectors.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 These are going to increase margins. And additionally, we are also being more active in capital markets, leveraging the gap in opportunities that
the current rate environments provide us. So a very important impact in the short-term due to the decrease in reference rate. And after that, we
are going to change the composition of the assets. And there is also a factor in the cost of funds. For example, we have been repricing our funding
base in case of medium-term deposits. And even in the bonds, recently, we have issued very successfully a bond -- a couple of bonds at BCP,
lowering the rate from 6-point something to low 3%. That helps in our cost funds, and it's going to be felt starting the last quarter of this year.

Operator
And our next question will come from Alonso Garcia with Crédit Suisse.

Ricardo Alonso Garcia - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
My question is also on efficiency and also touching base on ROE. I mean, it looks like efficiency will probably be the strongest driver in the coming
years to return ROE near to pre-pandemic levels of high teens. However, as you mentioned in the presentation, efficiency for the company has
remained largely stable over the past few years at the group level with only some slight improvement in BCP.

So considering that challenges in top line will likely continue, given the low rate scenario and pressures on fees or to digitalization process. Could
you please provide some color on the level of OpEx growth behind your efficiency and ROE guidance that you have provided? I mean, are you
anticipating low single-digit growth in expenses to achieve these flat expenses? And also on the short term, how much can you lower expenses in
the short-term to tackle the short-term pressures in top line and cost of risk this year?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Okay. Thank you. I think in terms of profitability dynamics, the efficiencies are key, of course. But in the short term, I am referring short-term next
year, basically, we are going to have a significant adjustment in the cost of risk also. The impact in risk this year is significant and it's going to be
significant, but we expect a decrease in the cost of risk next year and down the road, an evolution in line with the composition of the portfolio.

So the cost of risk is going to be a key element also to achieve higher levels of profitability. And in terms of efficiency, we have different dynamics.
We have, I will say, a more day-to-day dynamics based on a strong discipline, control of costs and looking for marginal improvements that are
going to help to maintain a reasonable and very controlled cost base. But at the same time, we are working in a more transformational initiatives
that are solidly anchored in digital models, but also in business models.

What I'm trying to say? Down the road, the digital transformation is going to help us decrease distribution cost and gain scalability, but we are also,
as a result of that, questioning our business models in general, reducing the footprint, the way that we relate with clients and the combination of
these factors are going to be key to reduce the levels of cost-to-income down the road. But you need to first develop the capabilities, gain scale,
and we are exactly in this process right now.

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Yes. Let me add something to that with a little bit more of a longer vision. As we have mentioned in our presentation, we continue to see a lot of
growth opportunities, particularly in Peru. The numbers that I mentioned in my presentation indicate that we would double the size of our loan
portfolio at both banks within the next 10 years as we have doubled the size of the portfolio in the past. But this time around, there will be one
important difference, which is that we will not have to double the size of our footprint.

In the past, I think, 3 years, we have reduced by about 10% -- over the 3 years, the number of our branches. And only this year, we have reduced
by about 15 branches out of about 400 and something. So we will double the size of our loan portfolio over the next decade. But not only we will
not double the size of our footprint, which is the largest cost of element, but it will probably not only stay the same, but even be lower in absolute

                                                                                                                                                                             
 terms. So those are huge efficiency costs and tremendous amount of cost that we will take out of the system. Now those efficiencies and costs will
not flow to the bottom line, but will help counter their pressures in margins and fees. That is the dynamic that we see that will be -- allow us to
maintain the returns of equity that we have been used to in the past.

Operator
Our next question will come from Jason Mollin with Scotiabank.

Jason Barrett Mollin - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - MD of LatAm Financial Services
I just want to say that it's positive to continue to see Credicorp's commitment to transparency and open communication with analysts like myself
and the market in general. My question is really focused on capital allocation. Walter, when you hosted the investor event in New York 2 years ago,
you talked about utilizing excess capital, putting it to work, looking in particular at M&A possibilities. And you did make some small acquisitions
in micro finance, for instance, in Colombia. But can you give us an update on allocation of capital, uses of capital?

We've seen you pay special or extraordinary dividends in the past. These are challenging times, but maybe you can give us some color about what
you see for the upcoming years. In particular, perhaps providing more how you see the total return for shareholders. You did mention the strong
total return. And in other conversations, I can't remember if you actually mentioned it in this one that you expect perhaps the returns to come
more going forward from dividends than earnings growth?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Yes. Thank you, Jason. Okay. So first, let me tackle the strategic point of view regarding M&A. A couple of points. Our strategy has not changed. We
continue to be driven by organic growth and inorganic growth is a complement. We have had, as we have mentioned in the past, a lot of interaction
between the board and management as to what we are willing to do, where and what we are not willing to do, which is equally as important.

And we have, of course, focused on basically the markets in which we operate, which are Chile, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. We said that we would
not do anything transformational. And transformational, we defined as something that could be around more than 15%, 20% of market share --
of our market capitalization, sorry. So we will not (inaudible) the CrediCorp transaction. We understand the difficulties of cross-border financial
M&A transactions. So we will go about this in a rather conservative way.

Unfortunately, because of those parameters, we do not aspire to be a large universal bank in Colombia or Chile. With that amount, you will not be
able to gain the sufficient market share. We believe the universal bank in order to be successful, you need to be one of the 3 or 4 players in the
market. Otherwise, it's not a very strong franchise. So in those markets, we'd probably be more of a niche player. What niches do we like? We are
particularly enthusiastic about microfinance, as you have seen in Javier's presentation. We think that, of course, Colombia offers a good opportunity.
There is some market fragmentation there. And we think that we can transfer our model. And we've done this in a rather conservative way, first
with Encumbra as a start-up to see whether we could actually transfer the model. We did this for 2 years or 3, and then we gave one step up last
year with Bancompartir.

We need to digest, integrate and take to the standards that we believe can be achieved before we make the next move. So that -- and then we like
the asset management and wealth management business in those countries. So yes, we're constantly looking for opportunities, but they are not
going to be transformational and will probably be in the sizes of what you have seen in the past.

So if we go back to my prior response to the question, where we think that we will get back to the returns of equity that we have before crisis levels.
And combine that with a slower growth, particularly in Peru. Putting this into perspective, we think that Peru will grow, as I mentioned in my speech,
around 3% per annum. And this means that risk-weighted assets will probably grow around 7%. So the dynamic is a company that needs to retain
capital to sustain a 7% or 8% increase in risk-weighted assets with a 17%, 18%, 19% return on equity. So we will be generating excess cash. So the
total shareholder return composition, we think can be maintained what we have done in the past, but with a different composition.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Less growth, obviously the country will grow less. And since we have a higher level of banking penetration, the multiple at which we grow will be
less than what it was in the past. But to counter that, we will continue to generate excess capital, which we will give to our shareholders. So the
combination of lower growth and higher dividend payout, we think will allow us to continue to be consistent with our return -- the total shareholder
return to our shareholders. Did I answer the question, Jason?

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question will come from Tito Labarta with Goldman Sachs.

Daer Labarta - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
All right. A couple of questions. I guess, one following up a bit on the margins. Just to understand, how much do you think the loan mix will need
to shift to offset the reduction in interest rates? So another way to think of it is how sensitive is your margin to lower rates? Like can you return to
the mid-to-high teens ROE if interest rates remain at like 0.25%? Or do you need some type of interest rate increase to support the margin and
profitability improving?

And then second question on your provisioning outlook. Just to understand, you said -- you mentioned your payments are doing well so far. And
you're provisioning a lot more than most banks in the region. So just to try to understand in terms of how conservative do you think you're being
in provisioning?

Do you think if things work -- turn out well and people pay on time that you can reverse some of these provisions? And how much would that
potentially contribute to profitability? And so is it kind of thinking, is it like a 2-year sort of time frame to get back to that mid-to-high teens ROE?
Or given the level of provisions you've had so far this year, is it feasible to do next year if things work well and you're able to reverse some of these
provisions?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
I will just take a quick stab and then Cesar, I'll pass it on to you. We are right now in the process of articulating our 3-year program, strategies, plans,
budgets, et cetera. So it's a little premature. I don't have a very detailed answer. But the overall objective that -- or the path that we're setting for
ourselves, as we have mentioned before, is really trying to front-load as much as possible, the provisioning, so that we basically take care of
provisioning this year.

I'm sure there will be a tail end. Hopefully, no more than the first quarter next year. The bulk of the provision, we are really trying to get it done this
year. We think that whoever comes out of this crisis earlier, will come out stronger with a better proposition to be able to capture the growth
opportunities and the better customers. So strategy for this year, try to get as much of the provisioning done, so we can get out of the way the
issue of credit quality in our portfolio and start to focus next year on rebuilding our profitable business.

This is particularly dramatic at Mibanco, where the duration of the portfolio is about 13 to 14 months. So every month, you do not replenish or
grow, your portfolio starts to shrink. So the challenge next year is, of course, the NIM, but also the size of the interest margin because our portfolios
have shrunk, and they have only grown because of the Reactiva, which has very, very small margins left for the bank. So this year, let's try to get as
much or all, if possible, of the provisioning out of the way. So we can focus next year of rebuilding our portfolios and our profitable business.

So my objective would be that by 2022, we are back where we were before crisis level. Next year, we'll probably be more of a transition between
where we will finish this year and where we want to be more in the medium term. With this initial comment, I'll pass it on to you, Cesar, so you can
give us some more color and feedback. Thank you.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Thank you, Walter. Talking about margins, I think it's our convergency process. In the case of BCP, because we have had only a limited impact in
the size of the portfolio, since we start originating retail loans that is starting to happen right now, we are starting this process of changing the
portfolio especially in terms of mortgages, consumer loans, credit card that has been impacted in the short term, while probably in the commercial
side, the growth is going to be limited due to the very important amount of Reactiva loans.

In the case of BCP, the Reactiva loans amounts of almost PEN 20 billion. So in certain segments, the demand is going to be limited in the short term.
But when we start to -- starting to -- the clients are starting to repay the Reactiva loans at the middle of next year, the process that I mentioned is
going to be cleared. So next year, we are starting to see the process, but it's going to be more clearly in 2022 when the relative weight of Reactiva
decreases in portfolios. This is the dynamic for BCP.

In the case of the Mibanco, the dynamic is similar, but it's going to take a little bit more time due to the fact that Walter already mentioned -- is that
in the short term, the portfolio of Mibanco has shrink because the duration is around 14 months. So few months without strong origination has
impacted the total size of the portfolio. The dynamic is going to be similar, but it's going to take a little bit more time. That's in relation to margins
and in relation to provisions, I think Walter have his -- gave already a very detailed explanation, and I only would like to mention that we are carefully
monitoring the results.

And we think that this year, we are going to end up having not only a much clearer picture of the risk, but with a solid provisioning base for our
loans. In terms of content without other institutions in other countries, we need to take into consideration 2 differentiated factors. One is that the
decrease in GDP has been more severe. We are thinking about 12% or 13% decrease in GDP this year, with a strong rebound next year and this is
more severe than in other countries. And another effect is the composition of the portfolio with a relatively important exposure to Pine, that are
more severely impacted in these downturns. So these are important factors to the level of provisions of this year and down the road, the comeback
is going to be stronger also.

Daer Labarta - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Great. Very helpful. Just one follow-up. Just on the sensitivity to the lower interest rates. Do you need interest rates to increase? Can you achieve
your goals if interest rates stay where they are today?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Excuse me, I couldn't understand very well the question. Could you please repeat?

Daer Labarta - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Yes. Yes. Just in terms of like your profitability and margins, to get to the mid-to-high teens ROE, do you need interest rates to increase from the
0.25 where you are today? Or can you do it even if rates stay at these levels?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
The decrease in interest rate impacts our entire profitability. And as mentioned previously, we are counterbalance that with the decrease of certain
funds, the cost of certain funds, deposits, bonds, the change in the portfolio and doing a little bit more of gapping, investing in medium-term
bonds. Down the road when the interest rate increases as a reference rate, this is going to give a further impulse to our profitability, but we are
conducting our business plan considering that we are going to be in a relative lengthy period of low insurance rates probably 2, 3 years as a base
case scenario.

And the next question will come from Ernesto Gabilondo with Bank of America.

Ernesto María Gabilondo Márquez - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate
Congratulations in your 25 years (inaudible) anniversary. My question is in the digital transformation. During your presentation, you mentioned
that you have the target to have 70% of your sales served digitally. And you mentioned that the COVID-19 has helped to accelerate the digitalization
process by 1.5 year. So can you remind us what is your current level? And when do you expect to achieve this target? And can you clarify what
would be the year for the medium-term targets regarding efficiency in ROE? And then my second question is on your loan mix. As you mentioned,
you would like to increase your exposure into retail loans. So can you remind us how much of your loan book is in retail loans and Mibanco, and
how much do you expect them to represent of your total loan book in the next years? In considering this new loan mix for the future, what would
be the normal cost to risk and how does it compare to your loan book pre-COVID-19 levels?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Okay. Thank you. I think there are about 7 questions there. But I will pass it on to Gianfranco to tackle the first portion of the theme and then Cesar,
and you can complement some of the answers as well. Thank you. You're on mute, Gianfranco.

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
So thank you, thank you for your comments. The objective, this is at BCP level to achieve 70% of total sales is by 2023. Currently, we're at over 40%.
That figure is quite misleading because the denominator of non-digital sales have reduced. So we might see a downturn going forward. Having
said that, the idea to have 70% of digital sales is not just to achieve that goal for achieving the goal. It's because what we strongly believe is that if
we leverage on digital channels, we will be able to reach new segments of the population because the acquisition cost and the cost to serve through
digital channels is much lower than through physical channels.

If we build our whole distribution strategy based on digital channels, plus the data and analytics strategy where -- and capabilities we're building
on, we strongly believe that we will not only reach the 70% goal, but most importantly, reach new segments of the population that today, we are
not able to serve or to reach in a profitable way. We've been doing that for the last couple of years. Pre-COVID, we were already selling an important
number of personal loans through digital channels and bearing more risk because acquisition cost again was lower. Regarding the transactional
business, we're leveraging on both Yape and our mobile app. As of today, more than 50% of our clients are already digital -- what we define as
digital clients.

And on the Yape channel, we are actually achieving 2 goals there. One is to, again, bridge new and more clients but the other one 1 is that we
believe that Yape is going to be the most important channel in our financial inclusion strategy. As of today, we have close to 4 million clients in
Yape, 0.5 million are already -- were already unbanked -- were unbanked before. For next year, we expect to have 10 million clients in Yape out of
-- 3 million out of those 10 million will be previously unbanked. So it is not only reaching digital for the sake of being digital, but reaching digital
clients and through digital channels in order to enlarge the size of the pie and grow in new segments of the population. Cesar, I hand over to you.

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Okay. Yes, I continue with the second part of the question. In regards of the change in the portfolio composition, I think there are 2 different stories.
In the case of BCP, this trend has already been underway for many years. BCP in the past was mainly a corporate bank in the asset side and we have
been developing the retail banking for many years, and this trend is going to continue. The difference in rates should be around 2%, 3% more
growth in retail than in wholesale, with certain bumps down the road.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So the growth is going to continue, but not only different in rates of growth, but also in the composition among retail because when we -- when
the crisis passes, we are going to come back to serve the lower segments of the population that carries higher margins and also higher levels of
risk. But our good business is done in a good and controlled basis.

So this is in the case of BCP. In the case of Mibanco, Mibanco is already basically a microfinance with a certain Pine composition. So they are going
to be a micro-finance business with a (inaudible) PMI position in the portfolio. And in this regard, it shouldn't be a change in the composition of
Mibanco. Regarding to provisions, we expect to be in 2022 at segment levels at levels similar to 2019. But I would like to emphasize that at this
point, the composition has been -- will be already a little bit different. So the absolute level of risk should be a little bit higher than in 2019. And
this trend is going to continue based on the relative composition of the portfolios.

Ernesto María Gabilondo Márquez - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate
It is super helpful. So just in digital sales, you expect to reach 70% for 2023. And for the target for the efficiency ratio in mid-30s and the ROE returning
to high teens, when do you expect that, in 2022, 2023?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
I would think that in an horizon of probably 3 years, these are reasonable targets.

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
I would push for 2.

Ernesto María Gabilondo Márquez - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Associate
Perfect.

(Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to pass the call back to Ms. Cigüeñas, who will entertain the question from the web.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Yes. Let's continue with the digital transformation subject. We have some questions regarding that. ""Can you comment on the digital offering from
the other major banks in Peru? How is it compared to Credicorp? In addition, what are some of our popular fintech applications from new entrants
in Peru, and what is good for those applications?""

Another question is, ""Could you discuss specific KPI, but would you measure success of your digital initiative? Where you are now and where you
want to be in the next 3 to 5 years?""

And finally, ""Which profit pools -- sorry, which profit pools are (inaudible) to [lever] to fintech competitors and how are you conveying this split?""
I think Walter can help us?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Sure. I'll tackle some of the longer view issues. And then I would like to pass it on to Gianfranco to complement. First of all, if I had to guess, I would
bet that 10 years down the road, it will continue to be the 4 of us banks competing aggressively in the market and still having somewhat similar
market shares. And there are several reasons behind that. One, I think -- and I have a lot of respect for the 3 large banks with whom we compete.
We all have our strengths, our weaknesses. We do something better than the other.

And of course, we are extremely competitive against one another. So I would bet that -- and we're all aggressively embarking in very cohesive
digital transformation programs. So my bet is that down the road, it will continue to be the 4 of us competing aggressively against one another.
But the other thought I want to give -- share with you is that we try to juggle several things at the same time. One is, of course, we try to have
short-term results and quarter-after-quarter results and the margin and the provisions, while we continue to invest because we have to invest in
order to advance and even accelerate the transformation as we have described. So you have to juggle short-term with long term.

But on the other hand, we are also watching what's happening in the market. We have seen some very aggressive disruptions happening in some
of our neighboring countries. And we're watching very closely whether some of those disruptive business models come to our market. On the one
hand, Peru is clearly not the hottest market around. If there is a very aggressive disruptive model, that is invented anywhere in the world or in the
region, the markets that usually focus are the larger ones, the Brazils, the Mexico, the Argentinas and eventually, they get to Colombia, Peru.

So I think that we have benefited, as we have in the past, from watching what is happening in other markets to be able to anticipate the moves
and have a cohesive strategic response. Our response has always been, let's be very aggressive in transforming our own financial institutions, which
are leaders and have very strong brands and very large customer bases. While we transform, we build our own disruptors. In case we have to
accelerate the putting into market of those disruptors because we see somebody coming into our markets.

So it's juggling all these combinations at the same time that we think will allow us to continue to be in a leading market position down the road.
Again, we have a lot of respect for what our competitors are doing. And we think that down the road, the 4 of us will continue to have the relative
market shares that we have in a very competitive market, but very different models. We are all going to evolve from physical platforms into a more
digital platforms. And all of us are doing the same time while we juggle the short term, long-term and watching that nobody gets into our market.
With this, I would like to pass it on to you, Gianfranco, to give us a lot more color.

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
Yes. Building -- thank you, Walter. Building on what you just mentioned, we're trying to be preemptive, actually. Actually, the largest disruptors in
the Peruvian market today are the incumbent banks. I'm trying to -- I'm going to try to answer your questions at once. I do see that there are like
3 profit pools that are under attack, not only in Peru, but in the world: payments, foreign exchange, and electronic invoicing, factoring because of
electronic invoicing. And that's the reason why we launched Yape, which is today, the largest digital wallet in Peru, and our competitors have
launched similar wallets.

We launched Cocos with y Lucas, which is our FX disruptors. And we're in the process of embarking on a more aggressive strategy regarding
factoring. The case obviously we set KPIs for each of our digital initiatives, those KPIs or the kind of the KPIs we define depend on the stage where
we are in the development of our initiatives. And obviously on the horizons of those initiatives. So I don't know.

Yape today has basically 2 KPIs, number of users, amount transacted and the third one is number of transactions. Where next year, it will start
having a monetization indicators. There are other much smaller and earlier-stage initiatives whereas -- where the indicators are more related to
level of adoption. So that's what -- where we are. As Walter mentioned, we're trying to be preemptive and proactive. Obviously watching what's
going on, not only LatAm, but everywhere -- anywhere else in the world and trying to be the disruptor.

Specifically on payments, you could -- there are like 2 sides of the coin. One is, yes, we might be disrupting part of our business but you have to
bear in mind that in Peru, still 85% to 90% of the amount transacted by individuals is done in cash. So what we see is that we might disrupt part of
                                                                                                                                                                             
 our debit and credit card business, but we -- there's a huge opportunity to actually take an important part of market share out of the payments
that are done in cash.

Operator
And we will move back to our phone questions. The next phone question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.

Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP - Partner of Regional and Trust Banks
I guess, the slides are quite helpful in terms of the midterm outlook and some of the drivers that you think are going to get the net interest margin
back up. But can you help us understand what sort of pace you're going to be growing revenues of? Clearly, quite a few pressures in the second
half of this year. So how tough is it going to be? What revenue is going to look at -- look like relative to where you were in 2Q and give us that base
that you can start to grow off?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
I can tackle that. I think probably the most severe impact in terms of risk has been in the second quarter and in margins, in the second and third
quarter. Down the road, we have been already been booked a significant part of the short-term impacts of the reduction in the return of the
short-term investments. And we are starting to originate more retail loans at BCP. So probably the toughest quarters are going to be in this order,
risk, the second; and in terms of margin, the third. And in the fourth, we are starting to see a stabilization and growth in volumes and a more
balanced composition in the books.

Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP - Partner of Regional and Trust Banks
And you were very helpful on the risk side in terms of kind of saying provisions in 3Q should be similar to the first quarter. Can you give us a sense
on net interest income relative to where you've been? How tough it's going to get in 3Q?

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
The third quarter is going to be already impacted, as previously mentioned, and it's going to take a little bit more time to increase the margins. So
we are going to see still lower margins in the third and fourth quarter this year, if we are focusing short-term dynamics.

Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP - Partner of Regional and Trust Banks
The last part, when you say lower, is that after adjusting for the one-off in the second quarter? Or is that...

Cesar Rios Briceno - Credicorp Ltd. - CFO
Yes. Lower in comparison to last year due to the short-term impact that I already mentioned.

(Operator Instructions) The next question will come from Johanna Castro with Itaú.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Johanna Castro Castro - Itaú Corretora de Valores S.A., Research Division - Research Analyst
I have kind of a strategic question, and please don't take this rush because I know it's kind of hard. But in the current low rate scenario, I believe
that for Prima and for the bank, it's kind of difficult to get returns these days. But would it be better to kind of kindly push out of your balance sheet,
the large corporate clients who are in the asset side and try to accompany then the other investment banks to list equity in the Peruvian equity
market, and then solving issues of long-term returns for Prima and long-term returns for your commercial bank?

I know it doesn't depend 100% on you, but I guess the largest corporates in Peru that can be listed in the Peruvian market as your current clients.
So -- and this applies for Colombia as well, both countries have really it -- really small equity market compared to their size. So I guess I don't know
if there is a -- sorry for our question. Is this just how do you see this issue?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Let me see if I understood the question. The question is, why don't we take some of our corporate customers to the equity market? Was that the
question?

Johanna Castro Castro - Itaú Corretora de Valores S.A., Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes.

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Well, it's their decision. We'd love to do that. We -- that is our business, making underwriting securities, be them equity debt or whatever, both
domestically and internationally. And we'd love to do that more, but our customers have not expressed their wish to do that. But we would love
that. So now regarding Prima, what was the question on Prima? I'm sorry, the connection was not that great.

Johanna Castro Castro - Itaú Corretora de Valores S.A., Research Division - Research Analyst
No. Is that -- actually in the long term, the returns for Prima is there is no Peruvian equity market and it's kind of hard because it will be better to
have local securities to invest in. And therefore, that's why I'm asking for the long term, it will be better for BCP to have more a diversified focused
SME kind of portfolio and leaving the large corporates to finance themselves in the equity capital markets. So if you kind of kindly accompany them
the last corporate to lease, then you will

[toss] issues in Prima and in the bank's profitability

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Okay. Prima for credit corporate is a very profitable business. It requires relatively small amounts of capital. And it has been a very good business
for us in the past. The -- obviously the assets under management are off-balance sheet. So it's been a very profitable business. Now when you
manage a portfolio of pension money, you do want to have a good level of diversification. And by diversification, one of the key elements is country
risk diversification.

It's probably not a good idea to have all your pension money in one country. It's better to have it diversified. And that is what the private pension
funds portfolio diversification is. I think they have about 50% of their portfolio in Peru and the rest outside, which is a good hedge for a country
that has a certain level of volatility. So I think there are separate decisions, but whoever goes to the capital market, it's the customer's decision. As
I mentioned before, we would love to do that. So there's a couple of questions involved there.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 One is, is Prima a good business for Credicorp? Yes. Will Prima benefit from a more active domestic capital market? Of course, we would. But we
have been rather unsuccessful in increasing the size of the domestic capital markets. The only large players are the private pension funds, and they
do want to have a good level of diversification as is wise. And only -- and then the large corporates have been active going to the capital markets.
But because of size, sometimes they tend to go to the international capital markets. As I mentioned, the domestic capital markets is not huge. So
there are a whole bunch of angles around this. And I don't know if Alvaro or Eduardo, would you like to make some comments on -- both on the
pension funds or on the investment banking interest of our customers going to the domestic capital markets?

Alvaro Correa Malachowski - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO and Head of Insurance & Pensions Funds, Investment Banking & Wealth Management
During the -- this is Alvaro. I don't have much to add, Walter. I think you explained it very clearly. It's a limited capital market. All the funds, both
through Credicorp Capital and Prima, would love to have more options locally. But the size of the company's traditional structure of governance
in the companies, set a limit, a structural limit to that. So it's, as you said, difficult to change.

Eduardo Montero Dasso - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Investment Banking & Wealth Management
Walter, I would like to add something on the BCP side because from the regional question, I got that, why don't BCP pushes out its corporate clients
into the capital markets? We, at BCP, as Cesar mentioned it before, we've been in Peru for over 130 years, serving basically from the start, our
corporate clients. So it's a very long-term relationship with them.

We are trying to be much more customer-centric for everyone working with BCP. So from the BCP side, what we're trying to do is become not only
the most important bank for our corporate clients, but the best bank in serving their own interests. So we are a tough competitor to, I don't know,
Credicorp Capital, all the capital markets in Peru because we want to best serve those corporate -- large corporate issuers.

Operator
We'll move to our next question, and that question is from Andres Soto with Santander.

Andres Soto - Santander Investment Securities Inc., Research Division - Head of Andean Research
My question is related to margins over the medium term. And this is specifically related to the repayment of the Reactiva loans. When you think
about that discussion that we are going to have with our clients, that got this loan paying at 1.1% interest rate, and you will offer them a new loan
at what used to be 12% interest rate. How successful or how concerned are you in that -- in terms of the discussion being successful and being
able to replace loans at the same rate they used to have or Reactiva will definitely have a long-term consequence for your margin?

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Thank you for the question. We have had this conversation quite many times, as you can imagine. But regardless of whether there will be a difficulty
or not, and I will give you my opinions afterwards. We felt we had to do this. This was clearly good for the country. It was clearly good for the
customers. And regardless of whether it had any impact on our medium-term profitability, we felt it was the right thing to do. Some banks, by the
way, decided not to participate in Reactiva precisely for the reason you mentioned.

Will there be an adjustment afterwards, how will that adjustment happen? Will there be more political pressure once Reactiva dries up? And of
course, we don't have all the answers, but we think we've done what we had to do and we are confident that the market will play out itself -- by
itself at the end. And that once companies have used up the Reactiva, they will need to go to the markets and the markets will price whatever the
markets decide the price -- the adequate pricing is.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And it was a very competitive market to start with. So at the end of the day, we think the prices will be what the caliber between supply and demand
because that is what we think works. I don't think we can leave it a subsidized interest rate environment forever. So those are my thoughts. But
maybe Gianfranco, you have some idea or Javier? Do you have afterwards some ideas on how do you think the Mibanco's customers will react?
Which are the ones that have probably seen the highest level of interest rate reductions? Franco?

Gianfranco Piero Dario Ferrari de Las Casas - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO & Head of Universal Banking
Yes. Walter, on BCP side, that's exactly what we decided to do to be very proactive in serving not only our traditional clients, but new clients, new
BCP clients basically because what we saw was that we had to do this in order to improve the financial health of both our customers and therefore,
the country. For sure, there's going to be an important interest increase in a year time.

I agree with you, we will figure out and the market will figure out how it works. We don't expect to have any major problems going forward. And
in the end, is a market -- it's a client choice. Either they repay the Reactiva loans with their cash flow or they go to the market, not only to BCP, but
to any other bank, and they can get another loan in order to repay Reactiva at whatever the rates are at that moment.

Humberto Javier Ichazo Bardales - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Microfinance
Walter, Javier (foreign language)

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
[Interpreted] Okay. From Mibanco's point of view, we have been very explicit with our customers in explaining that this subsidized loans that we
are granting are part of our social role. And that we have distributed that because we -- the banks have received very low-cost funding from the
Central Bank, and we decided to pass along without even covering our distribution costs.

So we've been very explicit about this. So Javier is not worried at all. I concur with him. And I would further add that probably this month, we are
already at the level of disbursing 50% of the amount of loans at regular rates that we disbursed prior to the crisis. So reality, takes customers that
if they want to continue to operate, they have to take loans at the prevailing market rates, as Gianfranco was mentioning. So in the case of Mibanco,
Javier feel very comfortable that this is not an issue.

Thank you. At this time, we will move back to Ms. Cigüeñas who will entertain a couple of more questions from the web.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Yes. Let's give you a couple of topics. First, this question goes to Eduardo regarding wealth management. The questions are, ""Can you please give
some more color on the Panama wealth management office? It seems to be a service center. Why in that location? Can you give confidence there
is no ranking?""

And the second question, ""What opportunities to expand the asset management business would you consider in the near future after the (inaudible)
decision?"" Go ahead, Eduardo.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Eduardo Montero Dasso - Credicorp Ltd. - Head of Investment Banking & Wealth Management
Okay. I'm going to go for the first question. ASB, or Atlantic Security Bank, is part of the Credicorp Group since its inception, even further than that.
It is specifically a service center, but for efficiency reasons. We do not serve clients in that location. We serve clients in the region, mainly in Peru.
And I can assure you that we have the same strict standards in terms of AML and [KOAC] as we have in the rest of the organization.

In terms of the question about Ultraserfinco. Ultraserfinco has several benefits for us in Colombia. The first one is that it has allowed us to double
our assets under management in Colombia, going from $1.6 billion to almost $3 billion. In second place, it has allowed us to be a more decentralized
operation, a very decentralized country. Before this, we had 85% organization in Bogotá. Now that number is in the low 70s. And Ultraserfinco had
a very important presence in Medellín, which is Colombia's second largest city. We have a big interest on that.

We have also increased our leadership in the capital markets, close to 25% in the -- excuse me, 12% in the fixed income market and 25% in the
equities market. And besides that, the third point is that it has given us a possibility to really robust our platform in the U.S. for the region. But we
are very, very, very motivated with this merger that occurred in June 2020, and we have high expectations of the growth rates that we're going to
have in Colombia.

Milagros Cigüeñas - Credicorp Ltd. - IR Officer
Thank you, Eduardo. And now as the last question, we will talk about ESG. I would like Alvaro as sponsor of our sustainability program to help us
improve this question.

""What do you mean by putting sustainability at the core of Credicorp? Can you please give some practical examples? And the second question
would be, ""Given the continuing efforts on implementation of ESG initiatives, could we expect Credicorp to provide sustainability reports in the
near future?"" Thank you. Go ahead, Alvaro.

Alvaro Correa Malachowski - Credicorp Ltd. - Deputy CEO and Head of Insurance & Pensions Funds, Investment Banking & Wealth Management
Okay. Thank you, Milagros. We just finished a 5-month project on ESG on sustainability that ended up with creating or setting a vision for Credicorp
that Walter mentioned, and 3 pillars and 12 objectives. And all of them are somehow, to some extent, related to what we already do. So it's not a
project on philanthropy. On welfare, that's welcomed, and we will continue to support society through those means. But the critical element here
is to realize that what we do on a daily basis is what will make us accomplish that vision.

And that has to do directly with products and services that we offer, that we already offer or that we should be offering and how we manage our
business, how we make decisions. We already have -- when we talk about Yape and oncological indemnity at Mibanco and other products, we
already accomplished a very important ESG goal, which is through financial inclusion, provide a more sustainable or create help -- create in the
country a more sustainable and inclusive economy. Through transparency programs, the way we offer products and services, we help people learn
more, understand better and have a clear understanding of how they could become better and bring financial health to citizens.

So those are just a few examples. But the critical thing here is on the decision -- on the planning and decision-making process of everything that
we do. How we impact not only the bottom line of the company, ROEs and so on and so forth, something that has traditionally been very critical
for shareholders. But as critical to shareholders is how we will continue to be sustainable in the next 10, 20, 30 years, and that has a lot to do with
how we impact through those decisions to other stakeholders.

How? By launching this product, we affect community; how we help clients to have a better impact on climate change, for instance, through our
products and services, again; how we help suppliers to become better, better suppliers, better companies; are they incorporating gender quality
policies; are we supporting companies that do not go along our goals.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Those are the decisions that we do every day, and we have to implement in our planning and in our decision-making. As to the sustainability
reports, we have already started. We will have, by next year, closing this calendar year, we should have a much more comprehensive sustainability
report. Thank you.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Bayly, CEO of
Credicorp, for any closing remarks.

Walter Bayly Llona - Credicorp Ltd. - CEO
Thank you very much. Just a very quick closing comments. First of all, Milagros, to you and your team, thank you very much for organizing this.
You've done a terrific job.

At Credicorp, we are very enthusiastic about the next 25 years. We are particularly proud of our position in the market, of our customer base, our
employees, but we're also very proud of our shareholder base. As some of you may know, I have been in close contact with our main institutional
shareholders over the past 25 years. And they have remained rather a very consistent group of well-respected institutional investors from all over
the world. We want to really thank you for your confidence and continued trust with us. We have, as an organization, gone through crisis before.
All the crisis are different, but we have remained a resilient company with a combination of strong capital base, strong fundamentals in the markets
in which we operate and very solid market positions.

We are confident that going through this very special crisis will allow us to come stronger and be able to continue our path to growth. Again, I
want to thank you, all our shareholders, for your continued confidence and our Board for the confidence in the management, and to all of you guys
for making this happen today.

Thank you very much, and goodbye.

PRESENTATION
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This is Andrew Zilli, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury here at Twilio. Thanks for joining
us for our Investor Day during SIGNAL 2020, which as many of you know, is our very first virtual SIGNAL event. Hopefully, you were able to tune
into Just Keynote yesterday where we highlighted Nike's amazing use of Flex. We showed how Mount Sinai is transforming health care to be
digitally driven and virtual first, combining SMS and video. And we introduced Twilio Frontline to empower employees to engage with customers
over multiple channels, all via a single mobile app.

Now we know it's been a few years since we last held an Analyst Day, and quite a lot has changed. We're excited to have you join us today. Keep
in mind that we just closed our third quarter. And as we're still closing the books ahead of earnings, much of our conversation today will be based
on data available through the second quarter.

Additionally, following this event, we will be in our quiet period until we report earnings later this month, so we won't be able to host any calls
until after we report, and we appreciate your understanding in this.

Now everybody's favorite slide. As you all know, we are a publicly traded company. Keep in mind that some of our commentary today will be in
non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our most recent earnings press release
as well as the appendix of this presentation that will be available on our Investor Relations website following the event. Additionally, some of our
discussion and responses may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. In particular, our
expectations around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition and that of our customers
and partners is subject to change.

Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual financial results could differ materially from our
projections or those implied by these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors
that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on
Form 10-Q. And our remarks during today's discussion should be considered to incorporate this information by reference.

Forward-looking statements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect the events or circumstances after today or to reflect new information or
the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.

So here's the agenda we have planned for today. We're going to kick things off with Khozema Shipchandler, our CFO, who will take you through
our presentation. And we'll follow that with a moderated Q&A. We'll then welcome George Hu, our COO, for a Q&A session, and we'll wrap up with
Jeff Lawson, our Co-Founder and CEO, for a Q&A session.

For those of you on the Zoom webinar, we'll be using the built-in Q&A feature. (Operator Instructions) I will moderate the Q&A by announcing who
submitted the question, and then we'll read out the question for the group.

So with all of that out of the way, let me go ahead and hand it over to Khozema to kick things off.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Thanks, Zilli, and thanks to everybody for joining today. We'll be sharing a lot of financial detail with you today. But since we're doing this as a part
of SIGNAL, there are also a lot of excellent product features as well as some lighthearted features that I would strongly encourage you to view when
you have some time. They're all located on our website and should be available for on-demand viewing. But without further ado, let's dig into the
numbers.

It's been a while since we've done one of these, so we thought what we would do is start by looking at where we were at our last Investor Day. At
that time, we reported $115 million in revenue, 123% DBNE, 49,000 active customers and nearly 2 million developer accounts. Since then, we've
quadrupled our revenue, increased our expansion rate, grown our active customers to more than 200,000, and as you may have heard in Jeff's
keynote yesterday, we now have more than 10 million developer accounts on our platform. We've consistently delivered outstanding growth
across every dimension of the business over the last 2.5 years.

During this time frame, based on thousands of interactions with developers and deep discovery with our customers, it has become clear that
customer engagement has never been more important, and that is the driving force behind the demand for our platform. In fact, according to
Gallup Analytics, companies see a 23% premium from engaged customers in terms of wallet share, profitability, revenue and relationship growth
compared to an average customer. This is why companies are accelerating their digital transformation efforts and why they want to work with
Twilio to drive their customer engagement strategies. And these trends are driving a large and growing addressable market for us.

When Twilio went public, we stated then that our programmable messaging, voice, video and authentication products addressed portions of a
$45 billion market. Since then, we've added e-mail and marketing campaigns via SendGrid. We've added Flex to take on the enterprise cloud contact
center market. We've added IoT to help companies connect devices anywhere in the world. In addition to growing in the markets in which the
company started, expanding our platform with these additional products gives us a $62 billion TAM today. And with these same products by 2023,
it is estimated our addressable market will be $87 billion. And you can see that the growth comes across all of our product lines.

We have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and we're just getting started. And we're addressing that market with our leading customer
engagement platform. From the Super Network to our APIs, to products like Flex, our platform provides 3 things that companies need: digital
engagement, software agility and cloud scale. Companies across industries and around the world are using our platform to power the next generation
of customer engagement solutions.

The use cases are nearly endless when it comes to how our customers are using our platform from marketing to customer service to IT alerts and
more. Our platform allows companies to get to market faster with personalized content over any channel in a global scale.

In fact, we offer our products in more than 180 countries. In the last year, we powered nearly 1 trillion human interactions. And in order to make
this happen, our R&D teams work relentlessly to release new features and deployments, many of which are based on feedback from our outstanding
developer community. And in the last year, our team delivered 180,000 production deployments, which is just incredible.

But as you all know, it takes more than just good products to create a valuable company. We've built an extremely talented management team
with diverse backgrounds across the technology spectrum from some of the largest enterprises to systems integrators, to the military and more.
This year, we've expanded our management team by adding some great new talent, including Lybra Clemons, Chief Diversity, Inclusion and
Belonging Officer; Michelle Grover as our first CIO; Christy Lake, as our new Chief People Officer; Steve Pugh as our CSO; and Glenn Weinstein as
our Chief Customer Officer. And importantly, 10 of these leaders have experience at companies with more than $5 billion in revenue and bring
important experience to Twilio as we continue to scale.

So let's take a look at the results we've delivered and dig into some more of our metrics a bit more. We have consistently delivered strong revenue
growth at scale. Since Q4 '17, we've delivered a 60% CAGR and have more than quadrupled our quarterly revenue. We continue to see broad-based
strength and have experienced a modest tailwind from COVID as businesses look to digitally transform.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 While COVID has accelerated digital adoption in certain industries, we think these use cases will prove resilient over time. And negatively affected
industries, while hard to call in terms of timing, should also provide a tailwind to the business as they rebound over time. And that strength continued
in the third quarter. While we obviously just concluded the quarter yesterday, and we'll be working on closing the books ahead of earnings over
the next few weeks, we are expecting third quarter revenue to come in ahead of the high end of our previously issued guidance.

As we've talked about previously, COVID-19 has been a net tailwind for Twilio. Over the last few months, we've seen years-long digital transformation
road maps compressed into just days and weeks. In fact, in a recent Twilio global survey of more than 2,500 enterprise decision-makers, respondents
indicated that COVID-19 has accelerated companies' digital communication strategies by an average of 6 years, and almost all companies are now
seeking ways of engaging customers.

Our customers across nearly every industry have had to identify new ways to communicate with their customers and stakeholders, and we've seen
new use cases like remote contact centers, self-service, to contactless delivery, telehealth, distance learning and more. The new and accelerating
forms of customer engagement resulting from COVID-19 are adding to the secular tailwinds which have long propelled our growth.

We have a different model than many software companies, which is primarily based on the usage of our products. And it's this usage-based model
that allows for very little friction for customers during the adoption phase. In Q2, 76% of our revenue was usage-based, coming from messaging,
voice minutes, video and others. The remainder was from nonusage-based products like Flex seats, enterprise plans, phone numbers, support and
others. Importantly, you'll notice that both e-mail and Flex fall under both categories as e-mail has packages that are nonusage and overages that
are usage. And Flex has a seat-based pricing option that is nonusage as well as a usage-based component for agent hours. In general, the bias of
our revenue model to usage means that we win when our customers win.

When you further break down our revenue and look at telephony-based voice and messaging usage, the split is even more distributed. So while
our reported international revenue based on our SEC definition accounting for company headquarters was 27% of total, for example, in Q2, you
can see that our revenue split based on where we are sending messages and terminating voice minutes is actually about 50-50. This impacts our
gross margins as international markets tend to have a lower gross margin profile than the U.S., which we will talk about shortly.

In addition to geographic diversity, our business is diversified across industries. This is a select group of industries that are representative of the
broad reach we have. It's probably no surprise that IT-oriented companies represent the largest vertical for us, but we also have a great presence
in verticals like financial services, entertainment and consumer on-demand. You may recall that we announced HIPAA compliance for several of
our products earlier this year and the ability to sign business association agreements, commonly known as BAAs. Health care is a huge opportunity
for us, and we've already signed more than 240 BAAs this year alone.

I'd also like to highlight one other area, and that's political revenue. We know this is an area of investor interest, so we wanted to make sure everyone
was aligned on the contribution of this category to revenue, which was roughly 1% in Q2. So while the dollars are growing, the rest of our business
has grown so much faster that it isn't as significant of a contributor as it was in 2018. And while we do expect this to tick up modestly in Q3 and
Q4, it is not growing as quickly as the rest of our business, and we expect that it will remain a relatively small percentage of our total revenue.

We also continue to diversify our business across customer size. Growth customers, which we define as companies with less than 100 employees,
were 36% of revenue in Q2. Mid-market was 28%, and enterprise companies, which are companies we define as having more than 2000 employees,
is 36%. This is up from 32% back in Q4 2017, so we're making good progress here as we expand our presence at the enterprise level.

And our business is diversified across our product set. We've continued to expand our product offering over the last several years, adding Flex,
e-mail and many others. And you can see that application services, which includes products like Flex, Authy, video and many others, continues to
grow as a percentage of our overall revenue. When you combine that with e-mail, those high-margin products now represent about 28% of our
revenue through the first half of the year. But more importantly, you may have noticed that messaging has become a higher percentage of revenue
in the first half than where it was in 2019.

So let's take a closer look at the growth of the messaging product. Messaging is a bigger percentage of revenue this year than last year. Excuse me.
And that's because our messaging growth is actually reaccelerating at a very large scale. In fact, we've already sent nearly as many messages in the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 first half of this year as we did in all of 2017 and 2018 combined. Of course, COVID has played some role in this, but customer engagement via
messaging is becoming more and more important. And we are helping companies embrace this channel to provide a better experience for their
customers. And this is a great sign. Our biggest product is reaccelerating at a large scale. But as we'll discuss a bit later, this is also driving some
near-term gross margin pressure, a dynamic that we gladly accept in the near term.

Moving to look at our application services. This bucket of products is growing much faster than the core, and we have a range of products within
this portfolio. Video, to no surprise to anyone who has been listening to our earnings calls, is growing extremely fast at nearly 600% for the first
half of the year. Of course, it is growing off of a small base, but we are excited about our opportunity to build that into a significant revenue driver
for the company.

As I mentioned earlier, our core messaging business has also accelerated at scale. Additionally, there are subcomponents of messaging within
software that are growing even faster. Some examples of this are product like the WhatsApp API, conversations, insights and others. We're excited
about the growth opportunities here as customers look to engage across a myriad of messaging channels.

Next is our engagement cloud, growing at 94% year-over-year. This includes not only Flex, which we'll provide more details on shortly, but other
products like Authy, Lookups, Proxy, Studio and more. Lastly, other application services includes a variety of other products that are more mature,
hence, growing at a slower rate. Some of these products include recordings, storage, voice software, enterprise and support plans and a few others.

Speaking of Flex. We continue to release new features to the Flex platform at a blistering pace. It's important to note that we are not focused on
reaching feature parity with the legacy vendors. They have been amassing features for 3 decades, and a majority of those features are actually
never used. And regardless, the legacy platforms we're disrupting are not flexible nor scalable. Instead, we are providing customers the features
they want and need with building blocks in the cloud on a flexible platform where companies can build and own their own road map. Customers
are buying our platform to allow them to grow beyond the contact center and think about customer care more holistically.

In the first half of the year, Flex revenue was up 184%, far ahead of our total revenue growth rate. While it is clearly growing very well, it remains a
relatively small percentage of revenue compared to products like messaging and voice. So we aren't breaking out the dollars separately.

We have more than 600 customers using Flex today, and that number just continues to grow. In fact, let me talk about a deal we just signed in the
third quarter, which is one of our largest Flex deals to date, with a Fortune 100 insurance company. They were using an on-premise vendor with
plans to move to the cloud sometime in early 2022. However, in response to COVID, that transition was significantly accelerated. It was made even
more urgent when their legacy vendor wanted to charge them for more remote functionality. We had a relationship with them previously and had
built up trust, and they turned to us for more than 5,000 full-time agents and a similar number of part-time gig workers. Our platform allows them
to customize what they need from a feature standpoint and a pricing standpoint, and they moved very quickly. This is what makes Flex such a
powerful platform, and why we continue to be extremely excited about what this product will do for us over time.

I also wanted to give you an update on the SendGrid e-mail business. We closed the acquisition of SendGrid in February 2019 and delivered a great
year of results in that year. But importantly, we've accelerated the growth of the product as part of the Twilio family. In the year prior to acquisition,
SendGrid was growing 31%. And through the first half of 2020, we accelerated that to 36%. We've also grown the DBNE since acquisition as we've
expanded the reach of the product with our go-to-market team. We are very happy with our execution on this acquisition, and it has brought an
incredibly important channel to our customer engagement platform.

We've also continued to grow our customer base, adding more than 20,000 customers in the first half of this year. Keep in mind that the customers
we have signed this year don't necessarily yet impact dollar-based net expansion and won't until we lap them next year. We are building a diversified
customer base across regions, industries and customer size. As we continue to land and expand, this customer base becomes an extremely important
asset for us over time. And we're becoming much more strategic.

As you can see, we've more than doubled the number of customers who paid us $100,000 in the last 12 months. We've nearly tripled the number
of customers who paid us more than $1 million. We've grown the $5 million bucket by 5x and more than tripled the companies who paid us more
                                                                                                                                                                             
 than $10 million in the last 12 months. All of this shows that our customer engagement platform is becoming more strategic to a broader set of
customers. This is a fantastic trend, and especially at the higher end, a positive sign of our enterprise traction.

And speaking of the enterprise, we've talked about increasing our presence in the enterprise as an important area of investment for us. So when
you look at the largest of enterprises in the G2K, you can see we've grown the customer count by 39%. But more importantly, we've grown our
revenue from G2K customers by 650%.

Our go-to-market team is executing extremely well and helping us grow our footprint. It is important to note that while we've seen great traction
here, we still have less than 20% of the G2K as customers today. It's still early for what we believe is a massive opportunity ahead of us.

Continuing to move upmarket has other benefits as well, as you can see that our revenue churn remains extremely low, consistently below 4%
over the last 2.5 years for customers paying us more than $30,000 and $100,000 monthly. Our focus on delivering the features and products that
our customers are asking for with a highly reliable and scalable platform drive success for our customers, who, in turn, use our platform more and
keep our churn low. And as customers use more and more of our platform, it drives our strong dollar-based net expansion, which ended Q2 at
132%. As you all know, this isn't a number we forecast or guide to, but it does show that our land and expand approach is working.

So let's take a closer look at what makes up the expansion. You can see that increasing usage is still a majority of the driver of expansion. So that's
customers sending more messages or using more voice minutes. But we're also seeing improvement in the expansion driven by new products. I
should point out that when we talk about new products here, it's at the high level of how we describe our products. So this would be a messaging
customer taking on Flex or voice or video rather than an SMS customer adding a new region. So overall, this is a good trend to see in that we're
able to expand through both options. And in most cases, as we sell a new product, it will then drive that additional usage.

Importantly, Twilio's business model starts with the developers. We were founded by 3 software developers. And since day 1, we have been focused
on being developer first and making our platform easy and accessible for the developers of the world to embed communications into their
applications with very little friction and very low upfront cost. This slide is an illustration of how one customer scaled with Twilio. And we see that
with many of our customers, they follow up a similar trajectory.

In the first phase, a developer signs up for Twilio with little or no upfront costs and builds a prototype and watches as usage starts to scale. This is
how we ""land."" Developers start with one application or solve one small problem, and customers quickly increase their usage as they start rolling
out more broadly. And then this developer may want to add more capabilities and enable more solutions for their customers. And this is how we
""expand."" Our platform enables software developers to easily add a broad suite of communications tools to their existing applications, which are
then made available to all of their customers. And as they use more, we earn more revenue. And so as a result, when our customers succeed, we
succeed.

And here you see the combination of our new customer additions, the land piece, and our high DBNE, which is the expand piece. Customers join
our platform, stay on the platform and continue to grow. And that trend has continued with the 2020 cohort, which is outpacing all recent years.
We get customers on the platform. They stay on the platform and continue to grow as they expand their usage, add new products and add new
use cases. But we can't do all of this on our own, and we have built a great partner ecosystem to expand our reach.

Today, we have more than 300 partners in our partner program. And as I'm sure many of you saw, just a couple of weeks ago, we added our first
GSI with Deloitte Digital. Partners play a critical role in helping customers implement and customize our platform. And while our entire platform
benefits from having these great partners, the contact center can be a particularly complex area for customers, and partners play a critical role in
those projects. In fact, 70% of our largest Flex deals this year involved a partner. So we're thrilled to have such an extensive community of great
partners around us.

With all that, I'd now like to switch gears and spend a couple of minutes talking about gross margins. As you can see, our non-GAAP gross margins
have been consistently in our target range of the mid- to high 50s. We've talked about a lot of the things that can impact this number from
international and product mix to FX and more. And yet, we have still been able to keep it consistent. And as we've said, we are not focused on gross
                                                                                                                                                                             
 margins today, but rather on growing gross profit dollars. And we've consistently grown our gross profit dollars, which allows us the ability to
reinvest back into the business to take advantage of the large market opportunity that I mentioned earlier.

But again, different products will drive different results here. So let's take a bit of a closer look at our product margins. What we're showing here is
the average product margin for each of these product categories over the last 6 quarters. And as we've talked about, messaging has the lowest
gross margin of our core products, as there are obviously carrier terminations costs and more recently, ATP fees that impact the margins. But as
you can see, our other core categories of voice, e-mail and application services all have higher gross margin than our corporate average. So over
time, as those products become bigger percentages of revenue, we expect to see our overall gross margins continue to increase. And as you'll
recall from my earlier comments, our messaging business has reaccelerated. And at a relatively lower margin rate, that's going to negatively impact
the overall margin rate in the near term.

When we look at our product portfolio, product margins can vary. We put this chart together to help provide directional guidance across our
products. To no surprise, international messaging has the lowest gross margin. On average, international messaging gross margin is roughly half
the gross margin of U.S. messaging. This is due to structurally higher costs in most international markets. As mentioned earlier, we are experiencing
a reacceleration within messaging, the largest portion of our business, which has resulted in a slight headwind to overall gross margin. When
considering all of the ""problems"" businesses might be confronted with, especially in this environment, reaccelerating revenue of our largest and
most mature product is a great problem for us to contend with.

When considering some of Twilio's other products, U.S. voice, even with a telephony-based cost structure, has higher gross margins than the
corporate average. Furthermore, e-mail and application services products have gross margins north of 85%. As we showed earlier, we've accelerated
e-mail since acquisition, and many of the app services products are growing much faster than the overall business. We continue to have success
with these products, and that's what gives us the confidence for gross margin to accrete upwards over time as these products become a larger
portion of the overall business.

In this last section, I want to talk about our investment philosophy. At the start of the year, we talked about this being a year of investment. That
was obviously before COVID. Due to COVID-related dynamics, we have not been able to make as many of the investments as we initially planned
and expect to catch these up in 2021. So let's wrap up by taking a look at the investments we continue making to support growth at this scale. As
we talked about at the start of the year, we have continued to invest in our go-to-market organization. We have a very efficient go-to-market
strategy as our developer-focused model allows for easy, low-cost onboarding for many of our customers. And you can see we're one of the best
in the tech industry. And we've maintained that efficiency while growing our quota-carrying reps by 79% year-over-year in Q2.

We've also been expanding our go-to-market presence in international markets where our quota-carrying rep headcount is up more than 90%. As
we've continued to move up into the enterprise segment, hiring reps with enterprise sales experience is an important investment to allow us to
continue to grow our presence in the market.

And of course, we have to give those sales reps products and features to sell. So we are continuing to invest in our R&D function. We have over 200
discrete engineering teams across Twilio focused around the 4 key pillars you see on the page. We are building scalable infrastructure, fantastic
products that must serve all of our global customers, and trust through fraud and security protection is always the #1 thing we sell. Ultimately, all
of this is geared towards building the best customer engagement capabilities in the marketplace.

We also know that we can't always build everything, and acquisitions are a part of our strategy. A preponderance of our acquisitions have been
smaller tuck-in deals that added important functionality or brought in important talent. And of course, we've talked about SendGrid and the success
we've delivered with that acquisition.

When we consider M&A, we'll look for assets around customer engagement, product expansion, technology capabilities or something that will
expand our international presence and growth. We always go through a build versus buy versus partner discussion. We've been judicious in our
approach to M&A, and we do anticipate M&A will continue to be a part of our strategy going forward.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And quickly, we have made good progress on scaling our systems and processes to support our growth for the future. Our work is certainly not
done here, but a few examples of areas that we've been investing in include adding more automated billings features to our platform, enhancing
CPQ functionality for our sales team, streamlining our quote to sign process, and we are looking to upgrade our ERP over the next 24 months.

Finally, we believe collectively, these investments will fuel our growth for the foreseeable future as we address this massive market. In the past,
you've heard us describe our investment is geared towards delivering elevated growth over multiple years. In fact, we expect to deliver 30%-plus
organic annual revenue growth for at least the next 4 years. From a margin perspective, you saw that we have several high-margin businesses that
will continue to become a larger percentage of revenue over time, plus a reaccelerating messaging business. In the near term, we are focused on
growth, not at all costs. But if it means reinvesting dollars that would otherwise drop to profit in the near term, we will do so if we believe it generates
higher growth outcomes for investors.

But in the long term, there is no change to our model. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margins north of 60% and non-GAAP operating
margins north of 20%.

So let me wrap up. And in doing so, I wanted to highlight a few key items. We have a large and growing addressable market and are delivering
strong growth at scale. Our high-margin application services products are continuing to grow as a percentage of total revenue. We have a very
diversified customer base across industries and customer sizes. And finally, we expect to continue to deliver elevated levels of growth at 30%-plus
for the next 4 years as companies continue to adopt our platform to deliver the future of customer engagement.

And with that, we'll turn it over to questions and answers, and I hand it back to Andrew Zilli.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Thanks, Khozema. So like I said, we'll go ahead and go through the questions that have been submitted via the Zoom. So we'll start off.

The first question is actually the first 2 are related to TAM. So it comes in from Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho and Matt Stotler at Blair. What's driving the
TAM expansion from $62 billion in 2020 to $87 billion in 2023? And how much of that TAM do you think is greenfield versus displacement? And
what level of penetration do you see in the major segments that we broke out?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Okay. So there's a lot in that question. So let me just take a step back. So I think what's helped us a lot is that we've been in markets that have been
large and growing already. And I think one of the pleasant surprises that we always experience when we work with our customers is that they
continue to surprise us with many of the unique ways in which our platform can be used. They're always promulgating new use cases that we
oftentimes don't even foresee. And so I think that's one aspect of the TAM expansion.

The second aspect of the TAM expansion is our investment in new product categories. So as I pointed out in my remarks, we've started in
programmable messaging and voice and things like that. And since then, we've gotten into areas like e-mail, like marketing. We've gone into the
enterprise cloud contact center market with Flex, and that's driven a certain amount of TAM expansion.

And then I think the third dynamic, and this is perhaps illustrated by our relatively early foray into a vertical like health care is that several of these
verticals have not even really begun their own digital transformation journeys. And so as we continue to work with customers in some of these
newer verticals, we're also seeing TAM expansion in that regard as well. And then obviously, as we look at some of these TAM dynamics beyond
our own experience, we look at what some of the external analysts and so forth put together in terms of the way that they're evaluating and
analyzing the marketplace, and we use that to inform in part some of our investment decisions.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question comes in from Will Power. And the question is, can you discuss the sources of upside to Q3?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
There's not a lot, Will, that I can really say about Q3. We're not really providing any more details or comments outside of what was discussed during
the presentation and our 8-K filing. We expect Q3 guidance -- or excuse me, Q3 revenue to be ahead of the high end of our guidance, and we're
still closing the books right now, and we'll share all those details with you when we disclose our earnings.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Another question from Matt Stotler. 10 million developers is an impressive number. What is the total global population of developers that
you think can use Twilio?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I think as we look at the marketplace, we obviously do have a very strong developer ecosystem and we spend a lot of time ensuring developers
have the best documentation and APIs, understand our platform and can deploy use cases very quickly and efficiently. I think our developer
community basically signifies the hard work that our developer, of Angelo's team, does curating developer mind share and ecosystem.

Now with specific regards to the number, it's the number of developers that have signed up with a unique account. And so that could be an
enterprise customer with tens or even hundreds of developer accounts all the way down to a college student that's testing out an idea. I'd also
add that what doesn't necessarily put an upper boundary on that number, which makes it interesting for us is that we're seeing more users on the
Twilio platform that aren't per se software developers, but instead, they're IT professionals and are using products like a Twilio Studio and are able
to avail themselves of our platform in that fashion. So hopefully, that helps.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Let's see. We have one from Marcelo Lima. Could you discuss to what extent do you expect the adoption of 5G to accelerate the IoT business
and how big that business could get?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. We're very excited about the overall wireless business. We think some of the recent technology adoptions are definitely going to be accelerators.
You probably saw -- or hopefully, you saw and if you haven't, I'd certainly encourage you to watch Jeff's keynote from yesterday, where he provided
Jeff's keynote from yesterday, where he provided a little bit more color in terms of what we're doing from a product perspective to ensure success
in the marketplace.

IoT is a hard one for us to call because the market is so huge. I mean the TAM on IoT alone is just massive. I mean it eclipses even some of the
numbers that we showed on this page. We've tried to kind of confine it down to wireless IoT only and some of the capabilities that we think we
can add. It could certainly be larger than that. We have a great business today. It's a relatively small business. So we're concentrated mostly on
executing the business that we've got, but certainly excited about the prospects of that business in the future and think that we serve a massive
TAM, and definitely 5G will be an accelerator.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron at OpCo. While you post nice growth from the G2K, it still feels very low and under-penetrated. What
is the barrier for greater progress here?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Thanks, Ittai. Excuse me. I'll just take a sip of water. I don't think there's a big barrier. I mean I think it's just a function of time. George will be on in
a few moments to take Q&A as well. I mean it's one of the areas that we've been making investments in. It's been a more recent investment, I would
say, than some of the other areas we've been investing in. And generally, we're pleased with our growth in that market.

We built out that go-to-market motion basically over the last couple of years. And as we showed in the pitch, the enterprise contributes about 36%
of core Twilio revenues, which is up several points. And as enterprises look to digitally transform, I think our platform is going to gain prevalence
and it's going to become that customer engagement platform. But I don't really see a barrier other than time, and I think we just have to keep
executing and we'll get there.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Rich Valera at Needham. Does your 30%-plus for 4-year revenue growth target mean 30%-plus in each of these
years including 2021? Or is it a CAGR?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I mean we're not providing like specific guidance for every single one of the years in between. But we see an overall 30%-plus number during
that time frame. I think we're still kind of working out the details. We obviously have a forecast that we put together over a multiple year period,
but we feel good about being able to post 30% growth over multiple years.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Matt Stotler. Can you break out Flex specifically as a percentage of total revenue?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I mean as we said, we're certainly excited about what we're doing on Flex already. In terms of breaking it out as a more specific number, I don't
think we're ready to do that yet. I mean we're very happy with the progress that we're making. As you saw in the pitch, that revenue rate is growing
much faster than the overall business. COVID has certainly been a contributing factor in terms of digital transformation in contact center. We noted
one of our largest deals ever. Andrew noted our relationship with Nike that Jeff talked about yesterday. We continue to invest in the product, R&D,
go-to-market, sales specialists. And look, we've been transparent and also letting you know that Flex is a relatively small percentage of revenue
today, and it just doesn't break -- make sense for us to break it out, I would say, at this point in the life cycle.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler. What are the growth rates across usage versus nonusage revenue segments?
Nonusage is 24% of mix, but back in 2017, was less than 10%. So could you walk through the biggest drivers of nonusage growth and growth rate
year-over-year?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
I do not have those details at my fingertips. Zilli, do you have any of that math with you? Otherwise, we may have to follow up on that one.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
I don't. And my screen is up and sharing right now. But Brent, I'll follow up with you and get back to you on some of the details. I mean from the
nonusage percentage, obviously, that has some significant contribution there from things like SendGrid, right? As the -- although we showed on
the slide that SendGrid, the e-mail portion actually contributes to both usage and the nonusage. A bulk of that is in the nonusage bucket. So that's
a big contributor there. Additionally, something like Flex where we have pricing options that are based on seat counts versus agent hours can also
-- are also driving some additional contribution to the nonusage part of that business. But we'll follow-up if there's anything else more specific that
would help clarify that a bit more.

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Zilli, before you go to the next question, I just wanted to clear up or add to one of the answers that I provided earlier in terms of our revenue growth.
It is going to be 30% in each year. I wasn't as clear about that as I could have been. So just to add to that earlier question.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Nikolay Beliov at BofA. As you scale and have more purchasing power, could messaging gross margins go well beyond
45%? Are there ways you can alleviate structural issues that currently limit messaging gross margins?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I think that's certainly something that we look at. I think the kind of the general basis of your question is that as we aggregate volume, would
we get some sort of volume leverage? And I think there is some truth to that. So I think there's potentially some opportunity. I would encourage
you to remember there's still a lot of puts and takes in terms of what makes up the margin rate of messaging. We showed you some dynamics
around international messaging, for example, that are a lot higher, for example, than I think what a lot of folks thought just based on the way that
we broke up international. So there are going to be puts and takes. I think in terms of our total, we feel good about being in the mid- to high 50s.
We feel good about our long-term model being over 60% in gross margins. And I think we've got a lot of other products that contributed to it. And
messaging over time perhaps could be one of them.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Alex Zukin. When would you expect messaging revenue growth to normalize? And how important is bidirectional
messaging as a growth driver near and intermediate term? What percentage of total messaging growth is outbound versus bidirectional today?
And where do you see that trending?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Okay. So there's a lot in that one. So let me start with just kind of generally messaging. I mean I think one of the things that we're clearly really
excited about is that we had a great messaging business, and it has been growing historically really fast anyway. And what we've seen over the
last year or so as a result of partially COVID, no doubt, as a result of certainly a lot of hard work and the investment into our products that we've
been able to reaccelerate it. And so we feel great about how that segment of the business is doing today. And I think we feel good about where
that's headed, and that certainly informs the way that we're thinking about our belief around growth over the next several years.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We're not breaking out outbound versus inbound, specifically, but more of it is going to be outbound, which is probably not surprising. We are
very excited about Conversations. And I think it's a product like a Conversations, which really allows us to create that true customer engagement
platform, which obviously lends itself to bidirectional communication. Pretty early days there, but we think that there's a ton that we can do. And
as companies look to engage with their consumers, that's certainly going to be one of the features in the toolkit that they're going to build out to
build customer engagement.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Nick Lawler. Are newer cohorts more or less or similarly likely to start their journey on a higher level service like
Conversations or Notify versus the base messaging service?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I'm not sure that there's a particular trend there. I mean I think what we're -- when we work with customers -- I mean, first of all, there's like a
developer angle, right? And so a lot of it happens very organically. And depending on the particular customer that's working with us, they're simply
solving for a use case. And our platform, the great thing about it is that it has all of the different building blocks that one needs to serve whatever
it is that the use case is.

I think what tends to happen, as we showed on one of the slides earlier is that they start to grow with a certain product as they continue to build
out additional use cases or potentially go into other markets. And then beyond that, they start adding more and more products as we showed,
and that leads to a net expansion rate expansion, if you will.

So I wouldn't call out one or the other. But probably, they start with some of our more messaging and voice-oriented products. I wouldn't say that
there's like a trend that persists through the business in that fashion. They could start with anything and we want -- we are actively encouraging
them to use whatever it is that satisfies their use cases.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Next question is from Alex Zukin. The 30%-plus guide for 4 years is truly amazing. So I guess can you talk about the confidence to guide 4 years
out, coming off of a quarter where you didn't have enough visibility for a full year guide?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Well, I mean, I think that when you think about the near-term dynamics versus the long-term dynamics, the near-term dynamics are a little bit more
tricky, obviously. I mean we're still navigating a global pandemic. We're still navigating a variety of different macro issues, obviously. And so it has
been a little bit harder in the current year to forecast revenue. And we're not unlike a lot of other companies that withdrew their annual guidance
in Q1, just given some of the impacts like those.

And I would also say, like in a model like ours, we're 75% as we showed, our revenue is usage-based.

Forecasting in a particular period can be a little bit more challenging than in a standard SaaS business in the short term. But what we've done and
taken great pains to develop is a long-range plan, and we are very confident that when we look out over the next several years that we have the
ability to execute against that plan.

And we talked about the massive market opportunity, and we believe in our own execution, and we believe that we can continue to deliver those
very high levels of growth. Excuse me. And rather than just focus on the short term, I think this is a better way, honestly, for us to think about our
intermediate-term growth targets.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Derrick Wood. How much of your business is channel-driven or influenced today? And where would you like to get
that over time?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
I assume we're talking about like partner-driven and stuff like that.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Yes.

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes, I think it's still a relatively small percentage of the business. I mean it's obviously growing very rapidly. I mean we think partners are going to
play an important role. I would distinguish that there are 2 types of kind of channel/partners. You've got ISVs and SIs. We've had great relationships
with a number of folks who either are or act like ISVs for a long time. And SIs are clearly a little bit earlier as a motion for us. But being able to register
a GSI, I think, for us, was a great add to our overall partner ecosystem, and we're making great progress.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Good. Our next question is from Michael Turrin. Where are you in terms of international penetration? Mentioned 50-50 split on voice and messaging,
but U.S. growth has outpaced international year-to-date. So is there overseas appetite for the broader market set -- broader product set as well?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes, there is. I mean so there's -- just to maybe unpack that a tad. What we showed was in terms of the way that, that traffic is center-terminated.
What we disclosed when we break out our earnings after quarters is international based on the company's origin or company headquarters,
basically. And so that's -- there's a little bit of a difference just to clear up the question in terms of what we showed today versus what we historically
show when we break out our earnings guidance between domestic and international for SEC purposes.

Now in terms of our overall enthusiasm and investments in international, I mean, I think we're very excited about it. We're -- we feel like there's a
lot of opportunity in a variety of markets. We've been very specific about investing in particular markets like sort of one at a time on a kind of named
country basis, if you will, but we're very excited about international. As I noted in the presentation, we're hiring in international markets at a higher
clip than we are in aggregate. And so I think that remains a really important area for us to keep investing in, and we're very excited about it.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Next question is from Marcelo Lima. We've seen the impressive cohort and DBNE data, but could you give us a sense of payback period on sales
and marketing investments and LTV to CAC?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. We don't break out those metrics. I mean I would say, as you saw from the slide that I provided that we have a very strong ROI on our go-to-market
investments. We remain very low in terms of that spend as a percentage of our total. And I think a lot of that is attributable to our developer-first
model, and we feel great about the way that we've been able to spend money there and generate returns. And I think the proof of that is obviously
in our elevated growth rates.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Meta Marshall. Does that gross margin given on messaging include the A2P fees?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. Those numbers are all in. Yes.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
From Alex Zukin, video continues to grow off a very small base. But I guess if you could look out over the course of 4 years, what percentage of
revenue could that represent?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Well, we're just seeing a lot of activity right now in video. And we're not -- while we provided a forecast over the next 4 years, we're not providing
a detailed revenue forecast by product over the same time frame. What I will say is that, we -- you clearly have seen some tremendous growth in
video over the period that we just showed.

We're really excited about the product. It's getting great traction with customers. We are investing in it. And I think the notion of having an experience
all within the context of your app versus having to leave and use some of the other products in the marketplace, ours is a lot more attractive,
particularly when you look at some verticals like telehealth or e-learning. And we've just seen great traction there. So we're really excited about
what we can do with it, but we're not breaking out products for the next 4 years.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right. Next question from Nikolay Beliov again. What are the factors driving the 2020 cohort running higher than pre-2020 cohorts?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
I mean there's always a series of dynamics in these years. And I would caution you to kind of think about any given year as like having a particular
story.

I think 2020 has been just sort of a consistently strong year. I mean we've been growing and expanding with our customers in every one of the
cohorts. And even if you look back to like 2011, customers there continue to increase usage and find new use cases that they can leverage. And I
think what we're seeing in the current year is simply a trend of what we've seen over a long period of time. And I think, again, our investments in
go-to-market make a difference here, our investments in having really easy-to-use products make a difference here. And COVID-19 obviously
provided a slight tailwind, but there were some negatives in there as well due to some effect on customers. But I'd say it's just part of a longer-term
trend that we've been a part of for that time frame.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Alex Kurtz. With your guidance of 30%-plus growth over the next 4 years, how much will Flex contribute to that?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. Again, I mean, we're not breaking out the revenue guide by product. We feel good about the way that Flex has been performing. We feel great
about some of our recent wins on Flex. I mean, clearly, application services is growing faster as a percentage of our kind of total product suite. We
expect it to continue doing so. And on a kind of relative basis, I'd expect that it does contribute more over time. I mean, certainly, that's part of
what informs our long-term model around gross margins.

All that said, we've also got a reaccelerating messaging business right now. So there are going to be some puts and takes, but my net-net expectation
would be that it's a higher percentage. But we're not breaking out products today.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Meta Marshall. Are there any single product customers in the $1 million-plus annual revenue cohort?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Just to make sure I understand the question or maybe you can infer it. Meaning, are there any of those customers that are just using one product?

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
I believe so.

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I mean we don't -- we typically don't break out like what individual customers are doing. I'd have to go back and look at that data specifically
to give you an answer. I just don't have that one in my finger tips, Andrew, let's take that as another follow-up.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
We'll do. From Matt Stotler, roughly how many quota-carrying sales reps do you have today?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. Again, that's not a piece of data that we break out. We did talk about that we have very efficient sales and marketing expense. We did talk
about the fact that we've increased that number by 79% through the Q2. So we try to give you a few data points around the significant investment
that we've put into that portion of our employee base, but that's not a number that -- similar to any of our numbers that we're not going to break
that out separately in terms of our employee base.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Okay. Next one from Siti Panigrahi. How has your investment in product strategy changed since March from the pre-COVID world?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Well, I think the interesting thing is that whether it's product strategy or anything else, I wouldn't say anything has had a markedly different focus.
A lot of the investments that we talked about, frankly, back in January, which feels like ages ago, but from back then, we talked then about R&D
investments being important. We talked then about go-to-market investments being important, and we talked about infrastructure investments
being important. And so I think all of those have been areas that we've continued investing in. Basically, at the same pace and to the extent that
we can, we have had a little bit more difficulty in hiring, as we've noted in the past. And it's just harder, in some respects, to do some of this stuff
remotely. So that's what causes us to kind of think that the stuff -- some of this stuff rolls into 2021.

But in terms of product, if I was to highlight a couple of specific items, I mean, clearly, video, per the last question or 2 questions ago, that's certainly
become a really interesting area. And just given the excitement that we've seen with customers, given the growth that we've seen with customers,
I think that is going to be an enhanced focus area for us from a product standpoint. Flex, given the enthusiasm that we're seeing with customers,
the adoption rates, given some of what we noted even on today's call, I think that's going to be another area that we've been investing in. And so
I don't know that, that one markedly changes. But what we've seen is reinforcing, for sure, in terms of the product investments that we were making.

I think maybe it was a little bit coincidental, but like having the HIPAA certification and being a big player in health care, I think that was important
to us. And I think there may be some vertically oriented investment that we do there in that particular category, just because we think that's a good
one. But in general, I wouldn't say there have been radical changes in the way that our investment or product investment philosophy has evolved.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question from Derrick Wood. Do you anticipate any directional changes in gross margin within each product area, particularly when
you look at messaging and voice?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Again, like we're not providing like guidance on margins per product per se. What we tried to do today was give you all a sense of what are the
gross margins in terms of each of these different products. We try to kind of give you then a slightly more detailed level even on a scale in terms
of international versus domestic. These things bounce up and down from time to time. Our kind of revenue mix bounces up and down a little bit
time to time. There's FX. There's international dynamics.

So I'm not sure that I'd even be able to provide like a really detailed answer, and we're just -- we're not providing guidance at that level.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Another one from Matt Stotler. How do you think about 30%-plus growth for the next 4 years as it breaks down between new and existing
customers?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Yes. I mean, I think one of the things that's been great about our model is that we've continued to expand at a really great clip with a lot of our
existing customers. And so that kind of same-store sales metric, if you will, has done well. I mean I do think it's going to fade a little bit over time. I
mean it just has to, given how large the business is becoming. But I think we feel great about continuing to grow with a lot of our existing customers.
And if you just think back to that cohort chart that we've shared with you and just reflecting on some of those 11 customers as they continue
growing, I think we feel like it's going to be pretty balanced.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I mean new customers are going to grow with us. We continue attracting new customers at a really rapid rate. But we've got a really strong and
super diversified base underneath that. And so I think we're in great shape there. And I think G2K is another area in which I think we have a lot of
opportunity to grow and certainly work with our partner ecosystem, too.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Marcelo Lima. What big picture question do you wish investors were asking you right now but aren't?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Well, we tried to kind of tee this up in the beginning. I think that the focus of our messaging, which is not a coincidence, is consistent with kind of
the way that we think about the company. And you should certainly ask Jeff and George about this during their sections, too. But we're very much
oriented as we go forward around customer engagement. And we think we have a platform with all of the winning capabilities that are required
to help customers develop phenomenal engagement strategies with their consumers. And the way that we -- what validates that for us every day
is our usage-based model, which is maybe another area we don't get a lot of questions about, but our usage-based model that is kind of
self-reinforcing.

I mean every day we show up for work, we've got to earn our customers' business. And the fact that they're using our platform more and more
every day means that they're getting a great ROI out of the usage of our platform. But whereas perhaps before it might have been geared around
specific communications, the reality is, is that we look at the marketplace all through the lens of how do we engage with customers, how do we
allow our best customers and all of our customers to engage with their consumers and create the best experiences to be able to do that.

And I think in the big picture, that's really what this whole thing is about. And while we feel great about some of the underlying metrics, we feel
great about our long-term model. We certainly have a lot of confidence in where we're headed, otherwise, we wouldn't have said 30% over 4 years.
I think the real story behind the story is customer engagement. And I think that is kind of the transformative thing that's happening. I think that's
the secular tailwind that's behind digital transformation. And that's what's going to create stickiness and great relationships with us and our
customers.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Alex Zukin. Given the COVID tailwinds you have seen in the business this year, how do you think about comping those
growth trends next year? Is there any reason why or why not, given the new customer growth this year, with accelerated digital transformation
trends, why DBNE could -- would go up next year?

Khozema Z. Shipchandler - Twilio Inc. - CFO
Well, again, we don't guide on DBNE, but I'll kind of take the basis of the question. I mean as I said in my earlier remarks, what we think is really
interesting that's happened with some of the COVID tailwinds, let's say, is that if you think about a sector like a health care and education or
e-commerce, what's great about those use cases that we've been able to deploy is we think that we are supporting what is now -- what was already
a secular tailwind is now taking hold in those industries.

And so, excuse me, we think there's very resilient revenue in those industries, and we think we can continue to grow with customers that we've
landed there. The other dynamic is that there have been some negatively impacted industries, which we've discussed before. And again, I mean,
I don't know if it's going to happen next year or earlier or later, but we do think that the folks in ride share, hospitality, travel, those industries are
coming back at some point. And I think that's going to provide a nice tailwind for the business as well and allow us to continue growing.

How it affects DBNE again. I'm not guiding to that. We feel great about the numbers that we put up thus far.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. I think with that, we will wrap up with Khozema, and we'll give about a minute of a break here, and we'll welcome George Hu, our COO, to
join us for a Q&A session. So I just cleared out the Q&A queue. So for those that still have questions in there, we will try to get back to you or maybe
cover those as we chat with you over -- after we report earnings. But if you have questions that you'd like to post to George, go ahead and add
those to the queue now, and we'll welcome George here in about a minute or so.

(Break)
PRESENTATION
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Okay. It looks like we have a few questions coming in. So George, I just want to check to make sure you're with us.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I believe I am.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
If you can hear me, then I'm on -- then I am.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Indeed. All right. So we'll go ahead and get started here. I guess, actually, first, George, if you just want to give maybe just a minute or 2 intro on
what your takeaways from SIGNAL are this week and what you're excited about.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Sure. Well, first of all, it's great to be on this call with everyone. We're having a fantastic SIGNAL. I don't know how much of the conference you guys
have been able to attend, but I've just gotten great feedback from customers that are excited to do more with us. And I think that is the main
message is that we are seeing this digital acceleration not just happening in kind of our research, but now we're seeing it confirmed in all of the
meetings and reactions we're getting from customers. And I think there's just a lot of excitement about our company, about the space we're in,
and really about the potential to be long-term partners with our customers.

So I couldn't be more thrilled. And also I want to really thank our marketing team for putting on such a fantastic conference in the middle of very
difficult circumstances.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. All right. So with that, our first question comes from Alex Zukin.

George, you guys have talked about adding enterprise reps well ahead of the growth rate. So maybe just discuss the trends you were seeing this
year versus last in those larger enterprise conversations? And can Deloitte and others be helpful beyond Flex deals?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Yes. So that's a great, great question. Yes. So Khozema walked through some of our growth in investment and distribution as well as our momentum
in the enterprise and the G2K accounts and such. And I think if you look at the data, you noticed that our ASPs are going up, and we are selling
higher than ever before. I think you can see that even from the people that are speaking at SIGNAL. We have got 2 fantastic CEOs from Delta and
Nike. So we're able to access higher and higher levels in the organization, and we're having really a broader conversation.

I think that what COVID really did for us is it really enabled us to have just a different kind of conversation for a lot of customers that maybe start
with one use case. And if you look at Nike, for example, they started with no relatively straightforward SMS use case with us a while back. And now
we're having a very different conversation because, oh, now we've got to empower a front-line employees, and we've got to transform our contact
center. And we've got to add new channels with video or we have to do contactless delivery and update our mobile experience.

So all of this rapid change in acceleration is causing a much more strategic conversation, which means I think the ability to sell more products, I
think the ability to increase ASPs, the ability to build stickier relationships and the ability to sell higher, which is honestly been the strategy all along.
And I think COVID has been an accelerator for that for us.

And then I think that's also drawn interest to the GSIs to the second part of your question. And I think that there's something correct about the
question in the sense that I do think Flex has been a really concrete jumping-off point for SIs in general, not just GSIs. But from the nature of all the
conversations we're having with companies now, there is no reason why we cannot broaden the SI work beyond Flex. And in fact, even recently,
I've been in a bunch of conversations with customers who brought in SIs for, let's say, video work, which is something that was obviously not as
much on the radar a year ago.

So I do think that we're just at the beginning. We are targeting more GSIs than Deloitte. We view it as the first of -- maybe not a ton, but first of an
important group of GSIs we want to bring to the table. And we couldn't be more thrilled with the progress. And I'm glad you guys can stop asking
me when we're going to GSI.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Next question is from Michael Turrin at Wells. Can you talk about the Flex ecosystem announcement? Does that help unlock a certain subsegment
of the contact center market that was previously harder to reach?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think it's less about maybe unlocking a segment in the sense that we've always stated from the beginning that we thought Flex is a great
fit for the enterprise contact center because of the nature of the build model, the need for customization. And those enterprise contact centers
have legacy tools that they need -- they need to keep some pieces of those. They need to integrate with those. And so it's something that we've
seen -- I would just say more generally, I think that the ecosystem will accelerate our Flex momentum as we've been out in market with a -- for a
couple of years with the product, we've definitely gotten feedback from prospects and customers that these types of integrations, out-of-the-box
integrations, would accelerate deployment, accelerate or remove friction in the sales cycle. So I think it's a broad-based accelerator for Flex, more
so than I would say it's targeted at any particular size segment or industry segment.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 I think it's largely a continuation of the strategy that we laid out. And I think that's one of the nice things that I've seen in my time at Twilio is that
the core pillars that we lay out, we stick to and we grow with them over time, whether it's products like messaging voice or Flex or it's pillars like
enterprise or international. We take a long-term view and just continue to add piece by piece by piece to the strategy, which is great.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Anouk Dey at Endurance.

George, can you elaborate on customers wanting to do more with us? Are new customers starting their journey with Twilio on different services,
i.e., Conversations than in the past? And when new customers typically start -- or when new customers typically started their journeys on messaging?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I would say that for historical pattern has largely been messaging as the Trojan horse -- like the #1 Trojan horse, entry point for Twilio. And with
the acquisition of SendGrid, I think it added another material entry point, which is e-mail. And those 2 are -- I just count of company, by far, the 2
largest entry points for us. I would say that Flex by count of company maybe has not been large entry point, but it is bringing us into a new set of
companies and decision makers, ones that have not been thinking about a messaging solution per se, but a contact center solution.

And for 2020, video has been an interesting entry point. That's why I'm very excited about the Twilio Video WebRTC Go product. I think that if we
execute that correctly with our developer animation that, that could be a very interesting new onboarding vector for us. And how that will play
out as we get through the pandemic and enter more of the new normal, I don't know. But what's really exciting now is that there are more and
more vectors and dimensions for companies to onboard onto the platform.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. We have a couple of questions here that I'm going to combine together, one from Jeff Kvaal and one from Alex Zukin. Just around the
competitive environment with Microsoft announcing their Azure Communication Services, kind of just what you see as the evolution of the
competitive dynamic, how we've differentiated against them and how that's changed over time.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I would say that taking a step back and look at the big picture here, I mean, I was at Salesforce, as many of you know, for 13 years, and we had --
we launched plenty of products. And there's plenty of pure-play companies that all did very, very well despite that. And I think the reality is that
while we respect every company out there, we know that we are more focused on this space than anyone else, and we are putting all our energy
into this like no other company in the market is. And you see that in the breadth of our vision, the investments we're making, the platform and the
developer momentum. And I think that you can -- it's kind of a little bit of a shame we're on a virtual conference versus a physical conference this
year. I think you'd feel it even more how much energy there really is around this company right now.

So over the long term, I think we're going to win by basically being against any particular company out there by being more focused in really the
things that we do really well, APIs, cloud, developer, breadth of vision, complete platform and the quality of our people and the teams and ecosystem
we bring to that. I think those are all the core competitive areas we're going to win on.

In the short term, I think right now, our understanding is they're pretty early days. And I think there's not a lot of comparison right now. But we're
focused on the long term, and we're not honestly focused on any particular competitor. We're focused on just a huge market opportunity in front
of us and how we're going to execute and meet customer needs better than anyone else.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Our next question is from Ryan MacWilliams at Stephens. George, has your strategy to engage new enterprise customer shifted as a result of COVID?
And have any products launched over the last 2 years particularly resonated with those customers?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I think that at a tactical level, obviously, things have changed. We're not flying around on planes anymore, different tactics you use in a video world
at the top of the funnel get to kind of get the meetings and move the cycles forward. So I think some -- at the tactical level, yes, there are some
differences.

But I would say, largely, it's been pretty similar, I would say, in the sense that we have a set of plays that we've been using to kind of get our foot
in the door. A lot of them have historically, as I mentioned, been around messaging. Are we doing some more of them? Yes. As I mentioned, we
have some new vectors to go in. But a lot of them are also, frankly, just new use cases around the vectors we already had like messaging, for example,
like whether it's contactless delivery or notifications around deliveries and things like that. So I think it's largely accelerated the motions we have
with maybe a few new tactics sprinkled in.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Will Power. Twilio Frontline looks like a very cool product. Can you talk about some of the early use cases and any
early comments from customers?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Yes, I think it's a cool product, too. And I think it's really a great product that has been borne out of, honestly, the evolution of kind of the discussions
we've had with customers out of things like our Conversations product, where they've -- there's been a lot of excitement around the vision, but
customers basically wanted to lower the lift, frankly, to build some of the tooling and the end user application side of it. So we're excited about it.
And I think it's going to be very helpful in a couple of core use cases.

So where are we seeing it? We're seeing it in retail clienteling. We're seeing it in wealth management. We're seeing it in kind of that last-mile delivery,
logistics, things like that. We're seeing it in field service, so things like the Comcast technician type person who's going to come to your house.

Those are kind of the 4 core use cases that we're designing around. And early feedback is good. And obviously, it's a newer product, so there's a
lot of things they want, a lot of features and additions and things they want. But at the end of day, there's a lot of excitement around the product.
I do think that I view this as part of a solution, and I think it will complement Flex very well. I think this is a great way of driving some fueling in other
parts -- in more parts of the messaging business and the Conversations product. And I think I view it more as part of a solution than maybe like a
stand-alone massive revenue driver on its own. But I do think it's going to be a cool part of the solution as you -- the adjective you used.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. We have a few questions. Again, I'm going to try to combine together various questions from Will Power, Ittai Kidron and Nikolay around
the G2K.

So what are the keys to driving deeper penetration over the next several years in the G2K? What kind of are the barriers to getting in and how do
you think about the acquisition cost versus the pure developer-led go-to-market side of things?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Good question. So I mean I think the most fundamental thing you need is you need capacity. I mean you need distribution capacity, you need
people that are willing to go and go talk to customers. I think that's a lot of still -- even if we're not traveling, it still takes time to build relationships
and go through all of the process it takes just to get into an enterprise.

To support that does take a different set of resources. Some of those are external to the company, like the GSIs, as we talked about already on this
call. But also, we've brought in a set of things like vertical specialists on things like health care and financial services. We've complemented that on
the product side with investments and things like HIPAA and other types of compliance and security and enterprise technologies or features.

So yes, it is a different investment model to penetrate the enterprise. The return from that obviously comes from bigger transaction sizes. And also,
I think that the enterprise is the most fertile ground for us to sell our highest value, stickiest, most interesting products, especially around the
application services area.

So long term, I think the enterprise is the place that we're not just going to be able to get to 7, 8 figure-type annual relationships, but also ones
that have like a really, really good mix of the types of higher level, higher-margin services and products that we get more and more excited about
in the company. So I think that's a long-term payout for making that investment today.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler. Given your background in scaling multibillion-dollar models at Salesforce, the 30%-plus
growth bogey would put revenue at $5 billion to $6 billion over the next 4 to 5 years. So what are the biggest hurdles internally that still need to
be addressed to scale Twilio from a $1 billion-plus to the $5 billion to $6 billion scale?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think that there's probably nothing I'm going to say that's too shocking in the answer. I remember when I was at Salesforce, there was --
when I was over there as COO, one of the first things I tackled was a big investment in systems to really overhaul a lot of the systems that we had.
Things -- a lot of things are being done manually. That's why I'm very excited about hiring Michelle Grover, our CIO. She is fantastic. And I think it's
probably a sign of the things we need to do, the fact that she's our first CIO at this point in our journey. So I think that's one.

Obviously, we have to hire well, hire smart and hire great leadership across the company, especially in areas that are more nascent. This is the time
you bring in the builders for your global regions, for your key functions, for different segments. I think we've done a great job of that. We've got
now, I think, some just fantastic leadership. Especially, I can speak for the area that I'm more responsible for on the go-to-market side. We've got
some phenomenal leaders that I think have a lot of scale in them. And so I think that plus investment in the systems and the processes are the keys.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Derek Wood. Given how much the environment has changed and how you've seen demand for some many new use
cases and initiatives come your way, how have you instructed the sales force to evolve the messaging? And what are you doing to shift to do more
solution selling?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Great question. So this has been a big area of focus for us to move away from selling APIs to really doing deeper discovery and solution selling. I
have to credit our enablement team and our product marketing team. They've put together a fantastic program that we call Use Case University
where we really -- we used to -- when I first started, we did -- our sales enablement was focused on here. We're going to train you how to sell SMS.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We're going to train you how to sell voice. And now we've moved completely away from that to here's peers' core use cases, both horizontally and
vertically. Here's how you have these conversations. Here's the questions you ask.

And even the way we hire people now, we put a lot of more emphasis on finding people that are great at whiteboarding, great at doing discovery,
great at having a very broad-based conversation with a customer more so than let's just say a straight technical acumen on how to understand
our technology.

And I think that's just part of the natural evolution of the business. And we know we're still early days in it, but I feel really good about where we
are, and the feedback from the field has been fantastic.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Alex Kurtz. On the health care front, who are you displacing? And how much does that sales team need to be built
out to capture the opportunity here in the U.S.?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think that who we're displacing depends obviously by product. And sometimes, these are new use cases. Sometimes, they're existing use
cases. So that's a pretty broad question to answer. I don't think there's anything massively surprising.

I will say on the video side, what is interesting -- or the telehealth side, what's interesting is -- and I think it's part of a broader phenomenon we're
seeing, which is even beyond health care, is that when the pandemic first hit, we saw a bunch of companies put in horizontal video applications,
the ones that you and I use everyday as knowledge workers to do meetings and try to use them for things like distance learning, telehealth, financial
-- wealth management, exam proctoring, what have you. And they were just never really purpose-built -- these horizontals options were never
purpose-built for these things. And so now people are taking wave 2 and coming back in and replacing them with more purpose-built applications,
which is where you need a platform, where you bring in your developers. And I think that's what -- that's a trend that favors us over time.

And if you look at some of the telehealth wins we've had, it's not that there wasn't an existing tool, but it was typically not very customizable,
off-the-shelf video application. And then when COVID hit and things would need to change, it was suddenly -- uh-oh, we can't modify it. We can't
change it. So we got to turn to Twilio.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Mark Murphy. Did usage revenue from the travel hospitality verticals actually contract materially during the
pandemic? Or were there enough situations such as Delta in which they found new use cases for Twilio that they held steady throughout? And if
it did contract, when do you expect a full recovery?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think that we've already talked before in some of our previous earnings calls that we -- our success broadly was due to, I think, a diverse
customer base and diversified industry especially. And so, I mean, broadly speaking, travel and hospitality was not -- was somewhat negatively
impacted by COVID, and that was offset by gains we saw in other areas that we've already talked about. So I think that's probably the broader
narrative.

We have seen some bounce back, but it's probably what you would expect, given what you see in the broader economy. And I don't think there's
like a huge story there, I think. As those sectors recover in the broader economy, we'll see them -- we'll kind of generally go along with it. Our hope
is obviously that while we're doing that, that we are going to also keep a lot of the thing -- the gains we've gotten into these other industries.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And also, frankly, that we do really believe what we're saying about this digital acceleration, that it's not just this is a temporary thing and everything
is back to normal. We do really think that a lot of things have moved from physical to digital and will continue to stay that way. And when we talk
to our customers, like some of the biggest financial services customers we have, they're not planning for the world just magically snap back to
everything is going to go back to physical again. They're planning on a huge chunk of that staying digital, and that is, I think, what we believe as
well.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Meta Marshall. You have noted hiring more contact center sales specialists. With most of those specialists being trained
on traditional on-premise solutions, how has the process been of transitioning to more of a modular approach with Flex? And has there been a
particular rep background that has been the most successful?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Yes. I mean, we have a specialist model today. So we're hiring like a kind of like a green beret team, if you will, of contact center specialists, both
on the sales side and as well as the technical sales engineering side. So -- and that's a way of saying that we're not hiring them in massive numbers,
right? We're hiring -- we're very -- being very selective and able to like really get the best of the best.

And it is a more technical sale. It's more -- it's a building block product that requires developers. And so we definitely are looking for people on that
side, especially on the SE side that have a little bit more of that vent. But by-and-large, we're able to find the talent we need, and especially the
volumes we're hiring them, because we are still largely selling Flex through the broader sales force and bringing the specialists as needed.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
And staying on Flex from Siddy Panigrahi, are you seeing Flex as supplementing the current contact center solutions or replacing existing solutions
at customer sites?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
It's both. It's both. It really just depends on the -- it depends on the customer. I think that what is exciting is that even when it is in Augment, there
-- once people get a taste of it, their -- people get an intention to really move through it more and more over time.

And so there's a -- not the one on the slide, but there's another insurance company in the U.K. that during the pandemic had to move everyone
home -- all their agents home. They were on an Avaya system. They had to do it in 2 weeks. They had to do it on Flex because they just couldn't do
it on Avaya. And now that we've gotten their CIO -- their CTO got a taste of the Flex platform, there's definitely a strong intentionality now to move
more and more of that Avaya stack over to Flex over time.

So I think that's the playbook. And over the long term, our intention is, of course, to win the entire contact center business for these customers.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. We have a couple of questions on Frontline again from Guy Tartakovsky and Greg -- I'm sorry, Andrew Frank. And it's -- the question is really
around how do you think about the decision to invest resources into selling a more packaged solution like Frontline versus letting the developers
create the solution themselves. And are these more packaged solutions likely something that they should expect to see more of?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Yes. I think it's a great question. And you know, one of our core values at Twilio is to wear the customer's shoes. And I'm really -- one of the things
I really like about our culture and our philosophy is that, yes, we're great at APIs and we're great -- we're platform first, of course, that's true, but
we're not purely dogmatic about these things. We -- our job is to serve customer needs.

And so when we as a platform -- Frontline came from, as I mentioned, a lot of conversations with customers talking about both our -- a couple of
years ago, just using SMS in these types of use cases to then maybe using conversations. And learning that there are a set of -- yes, there's a set of
builders in the world that want to do this part of the work, but at the end of the day, they really want to focus their time and effort on the things
that are differentiated. And the technology in Frontline is something that they were kind of just -- we saw a lot of customers recreating the wheel.
And how do you build a client -- or a mobile app that enables people to do messaging and handle kind of just the basics was not something that
we felt like was something that customers were going to build a lot of differentiation in. And so we want our customers to focus their development
resources on the things that really give them value and differentiation, and that's similar to the approach we have in the Flex.

So if our customer -- if that -- if listening to our customers brings us to more and more things that look like Frontline, so be it, that's great, but I
wouldn't read into this that we've made some fundamental psychological shift and now we're going to go do a lot of apps suddenly. I think it's --
the consistent theme is listening to customers and going where they take us.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Another question from Brent Bracelin. How ambitious are the M&A aspirations to augment growth and expand the portfolio, given the
increasing success and popularity of other API models like Postman and Zapier? And kind of against the backdrop of Microsoft, why or why not
would you look to be more aggressive in consolidating the best APIs?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
No. I'll go back to what I just said. I think that we have great organic growth. So it's not like there's like a we have to do any particular acquisition
to hit a particular growth number like maybe other companies think about it. No, we're focused on what customers want. And we want to create
the world's leading digital engagement platform. And that's what we want. That's what our customers tell us they want. That's what we think is
the big untapped underserved opportunity in the market. And to the extent that we can do it by building things, we'll build it. To the extent we
can accelerate that by buying things, we will. I don't think it's a view of, well, like we should get every API company and acquire them. I think it's
that we've got to become a great customer engagement platform and so let's do whatever it takes to go do that.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Greg Tory. How does the product road map look today versus 5 years ago? Do you feel like you've tackled more of the
known opportunity than years past? Or does it just continue to expand?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think one of the super interesting things about Twilio is that like when I joined the company 3.5 years ago, we're pretty much known for a
voice API and an SMS API. And at some level, you could say, well, that means that all the rest of communications is open to use so maybe you could
argue there's more opportunity back then.

But I view it very differently. I think that while, theoretically, the whole market may have been out there, what's realistically achievable, like a lot of
it was like 3 to 4 to 5 steps away from where we were. It was just too far away to really realistically think about executing it. And now that we have
e-mail, now that we have Flex, now that we have Autopilot, I mean, the things that are now like only 1 to 2 to 3 degrees of separation away from
where we are today are actually much greater. And so I think that it's much more strategically interesting today than it was even back then because

                                                                                                                                                                             
 what is -- the art of what's realistically possible for us is exponentially larger now given the surface area of what we have. And still, against the
backdrop of a massive untapped market opportunity. So I think there's never been a more interesting and wide open time for the product possibilities
here at Twilio.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Alex Zukin. George, when you look at the 30%-plus 4-year growth guide, what gives you personally the confidence
to be able to deliver that number in year 3 and 4 that may not be so obvious to investors at first glance?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think you got to talk to customers. I think that when you talk to customers and you ask them how far are they down on their journey for
where they want to be, the vast number of our customers say they're just scratching the surface. They're dealing with, like most companies out
there, even the biggest enterprises in the world, they're still wrestling with some of the most fundamental questions in customer engagement.
Like, how do we even understand who my customer is?

So we're certainly not in the eighth inning of a problem that's almost solved. We're at the beginning of a big opportunity that's unsolved. So I think
as long as that demand is there and as long as -- or that need is there, excuse me and as long as we -- you fundamentally believe that there -- that
digital engagement is the way -- is the way we have to reach our customers more and more, which I see and I believe personally, and I see it from
our customers, I think that the market is big enough to support that kind of growth, and then it just becomes a matter of execution. And I think
we're doing the right things on that side. We're investing and we're thinking long-term.

So when this pandemic first hit in March, we did not pull back our hiring plan. We kept going, and that was intentional. And I think decisions like
that and mentality like that, a mindset like that are what gives me confidence we'll do the right things to also keep that growth going years 3, 4
and 5 versus panicking and doing things based on short-term.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Derek Wood. How do you think about the opportunity for messaging services within the internal IT or internal business
communications landscape? Is that an area you intend to focus more on in the future? Or would you rather stay predominantly B2C-focused?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I think that we've got a long way to go in terms of in terms of business-to-consumer, business-to-consumer communications,
business-to-consumer engagement. I think that is where our value proposition plays best because where we are -- where our approach, where our
model shines is when you need developers because you want to do something that's unique and different and differentiated.

And by and large, B2C is all about that. Whereas internal, let's say, employee communications, do we have use cases for that? Yes. Is there an
opportunity for us there? Yes. Is it our absolute sweet spot compared to B2C? Probably not. We probably -- you probably want to be able to, like,
when you go to a new company, figure out right away how to use the tools because you don't want them to be highly differentiated from the last
company's tools.

So I think that's how we think about it. Now, look, if our customers say to us -- all say to us at the end of SIGNAL, this is all great, but what I really
need is a new way to actually facilitate employee-to-employee communication, then maybe we'll go have that conversation. I do think that Frontline
could open an interesting door there for us, but certainly, that's not the focus for the company right now.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right. Next question is from Guy Tartakovsky. With 97% of customers saying digital transformation accelerated by 6 years, do you see higher
top-of-funnel interest, higher pipeline coverage, shorter sales cycles, et cetera? And do you see more C-level engagement?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Got a lot to think of out there. There's a lot of detailed questions inside that one question.

So for sure, during 2020, we've seen definitely spikes in top-of-funnel engagement. And I would say, especially earlier in the pandemic, although
we still see very, very healthy top-of-funnel growth right now. And yes, and then that obviously makes its way through the -- through the funnel,
and we feel good about our sales productivity numbers at this point. And I think Jose might have talked a little bit about that.

So it's one of the things I've been very excited about since our last Analyst Day years ago is that back then, we talked about good sales productivity.
And I'm excited that we've invested as much as we have in capacity, and we can still talk about good sales productivity. So I think that's just, I think,
very exciting.

Andrew, I feel like I'm missing the very last part of that question.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Let me go...

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Or maybe I didn't but...

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Just go through it again. Just are you seeing more C-level engagement?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
All right. That's right. Absolutely. So as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing -- I don't think 3 years ago, there was any way that we would have gotten
the CEO of Nike at/or Delta -- and/or Delta to be coming to SIGNAL. And I don't know how many of you remember SIGNAL from 2017. I do, quite
a different type of experience than what we're doing today even in a virtual world. So really excited about the maturity there.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Mike Walkley. On the competitive environment, how rate-sensitive are buyers? Once a use case scales, what keeps the
customer for moving to a lower-priced competitor or platform running on an owned network, et cetera? And do you see this happening at all?
And if so, how do you fight back?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, I would say this, like, by and large, the vast majority of customers that we talk to understand that, look, like everything else in life, at higher
volumes, generally, people get different price points. I mean, I think that's true for us. It's true for every -- it's true for all software. It's true for the
company I came from.

And the -- but the exciting thing is that when I talk to customers, by and large, they say that their strong preference is to stay with Twilio, right, all
things being equal. And so our job is -- our job is to listen to our customers and make sure that we are with them. And for the core products they're
using today, making sure we're recognizing it when they do have growth with us and making sure that gets factored in. I do see us get consistently
a premium in the market because people value the breadth of our platform, the quality of our delivery, the quality of the APIs, the quality of
application, the whole experience. And then our job is to expand the usage over time. And as we expand our relationship, as we sell them Flex
and/or Authy or other technologies out there, it's like anything else in life, the relationship gets deeper and stickier and all the kind of things you
would expect. So that's our job.

But by and large, customers -- people really are positive on the experience they have with us. And so by delivering that great customer experience,
I think that gives us a huge edge in long-term customer retention. And you see it in our churn number and you see it in our DBNE numbers. It's --
we couldn't get those numbers if we weren't able to retain our customers and grow those relationships.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Anuk Day. What was the thought process behind pricing the Video WebRTC Go product at a free level?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Well, the -- we view that as a way of really going for it in the video product in the sense that, like we are seeing big growth in the video product,
but there's a huge untapped universe of developers that are basically trying and experimenting and prototyping on WebRTC. And rather than just
focus on short-term monetization, we want to grow the buy as big as we can. And we think the way to do that is by onboarding a lot of these
developers that are in their prototype phase and telling them, ""Hey, you can do the same thing that you're doing over just on your own, but get a
ton of benefit, have it run with a lot of the problems solved and also still do it for free.""

So this is -- I think this is probably the best marketing, at least in our minds, that we can do for the Twilio video product. And obviously, time will
tell. We'll see how it plays out and we'll adjust if necessary, but I think it's a smart play and we're excited about it.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Mike Latimore. The conversations API was a big focus last year, but didn't seem to be as big of a focus among
sessions this year. So how is interest there? And when you look at some of the larger Flex deals, how many of them involve things like just voice or
being more messaging-centric?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I think that -- it's kind of a bunch of questions wrapped in there. On the Conversations front, we are seeing interesting conversations. I view Frontline
as honestly a natural evolution of Conversations. So I think the fact that we're coming back and talking about another product in this -- that's really
-- it's really Conversations as an app, it's how I think about it, I think speaks to the level of demand at least that we see from customers for this.

In terms of Flex, the part of the core value proposition for Flex is the omnichannel value proposition and customers come to us for that. Obviously,
they don't go and roll out like 6 channels day 1. They typically start by getting their feet wet with one channel then add them over time. I just had
a meeting with one of our early Flex customers who started with us on the voice channel. Their vision was always to go to messaging. As of today,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 they're already at 42 -- or they've already moved 42% of all of their support load to messaging. And their forecast is the next 6 months, they're
going to move it to north of 80%, almost close to 85% messaging.

So I think that speaks to kind of where we see the direction of a lot of our customers are going, which is start at one channel and then add the next
one. Oftentimes, messaging is first or second on that list. But yes, we're -- we really do believe in this messaging-based modality for engaging
customers. And I think you see that in Flex, I think you see that in Conversations and you see that in Frontline.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Marcelo Lima. Twilio Showcase lets customers contact partners, but do you plan on building a curated app store where
customers can buy and use apps built by other developers?

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
I think that's probably a better question for Jeff. I think it's a little kind of more straight product strategy question. I think he's coming up in 5 minutes.
So I'll let him tackle that one.

I will say that having been at Salesforce for the app exchange, I do strongly believe in the power of ecosystems. And I think that Flex is exciting
because I think it gives us really that first center of gravity to build an ecosystem around. So I think there's a lot more opportunity there, but I think
I'll let Jeff give you the bigger picture there.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Sounds good. I actually think the remaining questions are also more sort of product and R&D-focused that I think would probably be better held
for Jeff.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
Great.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Thank you for now. That is it. So thank you, George, for joining us. Really appreciate it.

George Hu - Twilio Inc. - COO
All right. Thanks, guys. Enjoy SIGNAL. All the best. Bye.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
And we'll be back with Jeff in just about 2 minutes. So go ahead -- and if you have more questions that you'd like to submit for Jeff, go ahead and
do so, and then we'll get started in a few.

[Break]

Okay. I think we'll go ahead and get started. Jeff, are you on with us?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
I am. Can you hear me?

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Yes. Absolutely. Thank you so much for joining.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Fantastic. Thank you, everybody, for being here today. Appreciate it.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Jeff, I think we'll just get started with maybe just a high level, and it actually kind of covers one of the questions. But what are you excited about
that we announced at SIGNAL and kind of what's your takeaway from yesterday and today?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, first of all, I'll just say I'm excited to have SIGNAL in this virtual format. I mean, obviously, this year's thrown curve balls to so many people in
the world, and to be able to get our community together, investors included, to really be a part of what Twilio story and what we're building and
what our customers are building for everyone to learn from each other, especially when customer engagement, digital engagement, software
agility, cloud scale, like these are the things every company is working on to be able to get everyone together under one virtual roof, if you will, is
something I'm so excited to be able to do. And I'm really happy with how the team executed. I'm really excited, actually. It's a small thing, but the
fact that our team really stepped up and built the Twilio event platform using Twilio is such a cool thing to be able to do. And yes, maybe we
wouldn't have done that if it wasn't for the virtual SIGNAL, so that's a neat thing.

As far as the product stuff that we've been investing in and we announced at SIGNAL, there's so much to be excited about here. First of all, the
Twilio Video WebRTC Go I think is a really important product. Obviously, video is seeing such a tremendous growth right now because of work
from home and COVID and contactless everything. And we -- this product is really going to help onboard a new level of developers to the product
because WebRTC is open-sourced. It's built into every browser, so there's APIs essentially built into the browser that you can use that are free if you
don't need sophisticated use cases. And so in some ways, we're competing with just sort of like open standards, what's built into the browser.

And what I like about WebRTC Go is that we're enabling developers who are lured by that but who will then encounter all sorts of hard problems
that they need to solve if they go that route now can get started using WebRTC for free using our toolkit. And then when they realize there's all
these other things they might want to do or their use cases get more sophisticated, they've got a path to continue to grow using Twilio instead of
kind of going down the dead end and then having to figure out what to do once they reach all -- hit all these obstacles at some point.

Event Streams, I think, is a fantastic product because it's really unlocking the engagement data that Twilio has in a really streamlined way that can
enable companies to use all the data that Twilio has about how customers are engaging with them, using all of the channels that Twilio provides
in a really interesting and novel way. So I think Event Streams is great.

I'm excited about the Flex ecosystem and the Deloitte partnership that we announced last month, but really put forth at SIGNAL in a bigger way.
So the whole ecosystem we're building around Flex is exciting.

And then, of course, Frontline. And I think Frontline is a really exciting product for us because, I think Simon said this in the keynote yesterday, but
like basically, there's more non-desk workers in the world than there are desk workers. And so when we think about people engaging digitally, a

                                                                                                                                                                             
 lot of people think about sitting at a desk and at home and using tools like Zoom to like talk to each other or to collaborate with customers, and
that's a world a lot of us live in, yet there's more people who aren't at a desk in the world than there are in the world.

And so what Frontline allows us to do is to empower those frontline workers with an app and empower companies who employ those people to
really quickly build and deploy the right solution for all those people who are on the go, whether it's the service technicians in the field, the delivery
drivers, the retail employees, the health care providers, like people who are out there actually working with customers can now digitally engage
with those people as well.

And so I think that there's going to be a lot of new use cases that we start to see emerge now that we've lowered the bar and made it a lot easier
for companies to roll out those types of engagement scenarios. It was not unlike what we saw John Donahoe talk about yesterday that Nike has
rolled out using Flex. And so I'm really excited about the set of use cases that can emerge when we turn every frontline worker into someone who
can now safely and securely engage with customers over a wide variety of mediums and platforms.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
That's great, Jeff, super helpful. So we'll just jump into some of these questions. You mentioned actually the conference solution that we've built,
and the question from Alex Zukin was sort of around that. So you guys built your own virtual conference solution, which, by the way, was slick. If
only...

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Alex.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
I guess at what point can you feel the team like Ignite or Inspire, which I think are Salesforce and Microsoft-like teams, kind of take it into the Fortune
500 companies to figure out their major customer engagement pain points and help them build on top of Twilio to solve those problems?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
So I think I kind of missed the bridge from the conference platform that was really slick to what the question is.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
At what point could we build a team similar to Ignite, which is a team that Salesforce has? Basically, a team of people that go into a Fortune 500,
help them figure out the major customer engagement pain points and then help them build that on top of Twilio.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, we actually already do that. We do these workshops with customers already. And we have a team who will go in and essentially do the sort
of whole whiteboard design ideation phase with customers. And really imagine, we like to say the art of what's possible, right? And we've been
doing that for several years now. And I think that works out really well.

When we go in with a customer, we show the most possible with Twilio. And we -- instead of just sort of try to sell to them, like, hey, here's all these
products, you go in and you say, okay, look, what are you trying to solve for? What's the customer experience you're trying to build and your dreams?
Let's map it out, let's put it on a whiteboard and then let's map the journey to how one would go about building that. Because usually, building is

                                                                                                                                                                             
 -- it's not all one and done. It's a journey. You build the first part and the second and the third, and it's iterative. And so we'll help them map out
that approach.

And when we do that, I think we find that customers are excited about what we're able to ideate with them. I think we land more pipeline. I think
those deals tend to be bigger and the relationships are certainly better because we're seen as a trusted adviser, helping them grow their customer
engagement strategy, as opposed to just a technology vendor. So that is something that we've been doing for a couple of years now quite
successfully. And I think as we see success, we expand on those types of initiatives.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. We have a number of questions in here that kind of revolve around the M&A topic. So Thomas McGannon at Whetstone said you guys called
out some marketing tech opportunities when you did your last equity raise. Could you pick up that conversation, kind of help think about the
future up-stack market opportunities? And other people have asked about where filling out the product portfolio and some of the larger bets
versus where you might think about tuck-ins, things like that.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thank you for the question. What we tend to look at is where is our product road map taking us, where our -- and that's basically where our
customers are pulling us. What are the big problems that customers are telling us and showing us with their actions that they need big problems
solved, and therefore, where are we going as a company. And when we see opportunities to accelerate that road map and solving the problems
that our customers need solved through inorganic means, those are the types of opportunities that look attractive to us. And we're always running
the active game board to look at the variety of companies that could be out there.

And when I think about it, there's the category of things that are in the AI and ML space that can make use of a lot of the data that Twilio has to
unlock new outcomes for customers. There is capabilities as we grow internationally. We've done a couple of small tuck-ins to grow our international
footprint.

And then there's the engagement cloud. And when we look at the Engagement Cloud, what we see, because of how customers build on top of us,
is that there are major problems out there with the status quo and how companies have to stitch together various apps in order to have a coherent
customer strategy. And they're looking for a new way of doing that.

And that's the observations that led us to build Flex, to build a more flexible in-the-cloud solution that allows developers to go in and really integrate
Flex with other systems and build a much more integrated approach and not be locked in to the features and functionality that were in the box
when it got delivered to them, but rather to take that as a baseline and then go innovate on top of that. Because companies who innovate in the
eyes of their customers and the things that customers experience, those are the companies that tend to win.

And so when we look at that playbook that we did with Flex, we are seeing opportunities to go serve customers across a wide variety of areas. We
have talked about marketing. We see a lot of companies building new marketing solutions on top of Twilio, either on the SendGrid APIs or the
Twilio APIs, in order to engage with their customers in the marketing stage. And so we're curious to hear why it is that customers want to go build
new solutions, why the legacy marketing clouds may not be cutting it for them.

We also want to hear about other parts. And I think we've started -- one of the things we've talked about in the past is like field service is an area
where a lot of companies are building on top of Twilio. And I think Frontline actually starts to get at that problem domain. And so these are just all
areas, in the fullness of time, we -- our road map entails that we -- as we hear these problems, we feel an obligation in many ways to our customers
to go solve the problems that customers have in the world, and we have this great vantage point to see the areas of customer engagement where
every company struggles because they use our platform to go build a better solution on top of it.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so when we see those opportunities, there may be -- when we see those opportunities to serve our customers, those may be accelerated by
some inorganic means. But no specifics, obviously, to share, but we're always running an active game board to ask how can we accelerate.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Ryan Koontz. Jeff, how do you expect RCS to roll out in networks and consumer devices? And how will this affect
Twilio's core messaging business?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thanks for the question. RCS is interesting. It's exciting in the sense that RCS enables a whole new set of capabilities inside of the messaging app,
right? And so if you think about the world, it's like, well, there's certain things you can do in say, Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, and then there's
sort of like the dumb universe of SMS, if you will. And that's because the SMS protocol is like 40 years old.

And so what RCS is, is really an upgrade to the SMS protocols to give it some new tricks, to enable commerce to happen inside of SMS, to enable
photo care cells and advanced capabilities and like recommended next action buttons that make it really good for bots and marketing and all sorts
of interesting things. And so there's a lot of excitement about the potential of RCS.

Now the challenge of it is that you have to convince, what, a few thousand carriers around the world to upgrade systems, to adopt the same
standard, to not deviate from the standard as they roll it out and to build an interoping and working ecosystem.

And that's a big lift. Carriers, to get that level of cooperation, typically takes a lot of time. And so while we are excited about the technology of RCS
and what it can unlock for our customers and new use cases like doing commerce straight inside the messaging app, we know that it's a long road
to get there.

And so what we're doing is we're working with our carrier partners. We are having active conversations to understand where they're at in the
process, seeing how we can help, seeing how we can be a part of bringing the B2C, like the businesses want to engage with customers to the table
because I think carriers' first instincts in something like RCS are to think about the consumer to consumer. So you texting with your grandmother,
let's say, that's the first instinct that they have.

And what we are a great partner for is we have this great ecosystem of more than 200,000 companies who are using Twilio to engage with their
customers. And so we bring that needed perspective as well.

It's a good collaboration, I just think it's a long road. And I think the carriers kind of acknowledge that. They see it, too. And so we're cautiously
optimistic about what RCS can bring to customers. But we also know that it's a long road to get there.

As far as like other impacts, it's a carrier-provided product, and it will have -- we expect economics similar to SMS. And so we believe that, essentially,
we'll be able to unlock -- and all of our carrier relationships are a great asset here, and that we'll be able to unlock more capabilities for our customers
to do business inside of messaging. But it's not -- it's an economic model that is quite similar to the one that we have with SMS.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. This is a question that came up for George that we think was probably better suited for you. So Twilio Showcase lets customers contact
partners, but do you plan on building a curated app store where customers can buy and use apps built by other developers?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Great question. You should have asked George that. It's a great idea. Obviously, the idea of being able to seamlessly buy a solution from a third
party, plug it into the Twilio platform and light it up with some simplicity is an attractive idea. And I think an ecosystem like that is definitely an
interesting one. It seems like we are in the first steps right now of trying to create that ecosystem, of giving partners visibility, enabling commerce
to happen.

But I would say that an ecosystem like the one that you -- what you described is certainly of interest, but we're at the early stages of building a
platform that's capable of creating that kind of ecosystem.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Mark Murphy. Are customers asking you to provide them a customer 360 type of capability, not just across messaging,
voice and email, but essential repository to understand customers across all other contact points, like website, CRM system, e-commerce, et cetera.
Is this an opportunity that's attractive or better to hand off to others?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
That's a great question. If you want to engage your customers, you need to know a lot of information about your customers, and you need to not
just treat them like a row in a database, but you need to personalize and individualize those communications to make them relevant.

And so as we talk to customers about their customer engagement strategy, it's true that a lot of customers are saying, they are struggling to build
a cohesive picture of their customer. And so we are hearing that as a common problem that a lot of companies, especially bigger ones with myriad
systems or they've integrated acquisitions of their own, and so they struggle to get all these systems talking together, it is a pretty common problem
that we see out there in the world.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question is from Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler. So kind of a positioning question. So you've gone from customer engagement platform
or 2 customer engagement platform from a communications cloud. So how should we interpret the products messaging that has more recently
centered around customer engagement? And have you refined the thinking around what parts of that communication stack you're going after?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Well, if you think about -- we started life as a communications platform, and that's obviously where we began this journey. And what we've come
to realize over the course of the last 12, 13 years while building Twilio, is that the most strategic communications that a company has are those
that it has with its customer. And that comes from observing how customers are using our product.

And you think about there's all sorts of things that companies could have built using Twilio but didn't. And then there's all sorts of things that they
have gone crazy building. And when you really look at the pattern, the things that companies really feel they need to innovate on is in their B2C
communications. So how you use everything you know about your customers and how creative you are, how well you listen to your customers
and understand their core problems. And then they'll build that in a way that touches customers, that makes their experience better, that is one
of the most strategic things that companies do.

And so as we've taken and layered the next thing on top of our communications platform is a customer engagement platform to use our
communications in the way that our customers are already showing this as most valuable but helping the customers to accelerate their building
and to get even better outcomes and to integrate these various parts of their customer engagement together. And I see this tremendous opportunity
in customer engagement that is additive to our opportunity in communications itself.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so as you think about the story arc of the company, I think Act 1 is communications and Act 2 was realizing how a particular kind of communication
is even more valuable and is much more strategic than some other kinds of communications. And we're double-clicking there, and that's where
we're layering on Act 2 in the company. And we couldn't be more excited about that. I think our customers are, too if you look at the proof points.

Several years ago, before we started talking about customer engagement, is really what this is all about, I don't think you would have had John
Donahoe from Nike on stage talking about Nike. I don't think you would have had Ed Bastian at Delta talking about Twilio. So you wouldn't have
a John Donahoe talking about Nike because he wasn't there 4 years ago.

But you get my point. You wouldn't have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies talking about the importance of Twilio to their business model when it's
communications. But now there's customer engagement, it very closely aligns with some of the most important projects that are happening inside
of companies. And this is something we've been talking about for several years on earnings calls and in my shareholder letters, about how customer
engagement is one of the most strategic activities that every company is doing.

And the way we've been building our platform over the past several years is very well aligned to that. And you see it in things like our SIGNAL
keynote, where we're now really reaching into the C-suite, for people to sing our praises. And I think that's fantastic. And I'm so glad to be partnering
and working with those types of people on some of the hardest problems that these big, very sophisticated and impressive companies have. I'm
so glad to see that we can be a partner and be thought of that way.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right. Next question is from Matt Stotler, William Blair. Do you plan to add the conference solution that you've built here for SIGNAL to your
portfolio of customer-facing products?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
I was waiting for the question. I don't know. I haven't looked at the code. I wouldn't be surprised if it's one of those like, use it once type of code
basis, but I have no idea. Our team -- when you build a team of people who love code and love to innovate and you hand them a problem like,
okay, we need to do a virtual conference in 3 months, and we need to make it as good as the in-person conference and as compelling and as
engaging. And we actually set the goal, we said we want to be the best virtual conference of the year.

And our team really took that mission to heart. And so I'm incredibly proud of what we did. I don't think we built it with the desire to actually
productize it. That feels a little bit probably off the beaten path for us. But you never know, maybe we'll get a lot of people inbounding to us. So I
wouldn't be surprised if there's an opportunity somewhere in our queue right now, like, hey, mind if we use this? But I don't think that's why we
built it in the first place.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Next question is from Marcelo Lima. How much R&D effort is being made by Twilio to integrate the various solutions, for instance, e-mail, Flex,
SMS? Or does most of this effort come from developers?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
It's a great question. This is obviously an area where we take -- we are working with customers to understand how they want these things integrated.
And sometimes it's in things like Flex. When you spin up a Flex instance, it's got all the channels like right there in it. And other times, it's more like
at the API level, like when you think about like the conversations API, like it can pull together multiple different mediums into one sort of unified
API.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So there's a lot of different ways you end up expressing this idea of the channels coming together. And so absolutely, we are working with customers,
understanding what that means to them, what are the types of problems that they want solved in a cross-channel or omnichannel way. But it's
not like a one-and-done, like let's just throw out all the APIs into a soup and store it, you get the 1 mega API out. I think it's really taking what we
have, talking to customers and often learning from a lot of the early customers that we have about, oh, yes, we put together e-mail and messaging
and all this into this type of solution and learning from them about, essentially, what are the parts that are unique to their business and which ones
really aren't. And which ones they would have liked us to pretty essentially bake for them.

And so that is obviously an area where we are investing a lot of energy. But it doesn't always -- like when you say, like, are you going to do it? Well,
we have been doing it. We've been doing it sort of all along. You just -- it takes different forms and different products, but that's absolutely the sort
of fusion of these channels and making it so customers can build once on our platform and not have to worry anymore about this channel or that
channel or having to expend a lot of new engineering work when they -- when a new channel comes along or new capabilities added to a channel.
That is certainly part of the core mission, and that's what we've been doing with all of these products we've been launching for the past several
years.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is not surprisingly around Microsoft's recent announcement with Azure Communication Services. Curious about how you
see their ambitions in the market over the longer term.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll give you the same answer that I've given over the many years whenever a competitor enters the market. Like
when Amazon started building communications products several years ago, and Google did, when Facebook did, even when -- I remember when
Blackberry dropped a press release on the morning of, I think, it was our first public earnings call that they were going to go take down Twilio. And
so it's sort of the same answer.

First of all, it's a huge market. So of course, there's going to be competition. And that doesn't worry us because, second, we're no stranger to
competition. And the reason we continue to grow so quickly despite various kinds of competitors we've had over the years is our differentiation
and our focus. It's in the breadth and the depth of the complete product suite we have. It's in our relentless developer focus. It's in our super network,
in building that flywheel, which continues to grow, which you've seen, by the way, has been on fire lately, fueling that acceleration of growth,
especially in messaging.

And last, I'll close with we really don't focus on competitors. Like, yes, we're smart. We're aware of the competition, sure. But we focus on customers
because they guide the way. And I think a mistake a lot of companies make because is they focus too much on competitors as opposed to focus
on customers. And so we focus on customers. That's what we're doing, and we're going to keep building. And it's a big market. And so I don't really
particularly worry about any one company entering this space, just like I don't particularly worry about any of those others who have been in this
space over the many years.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
We have a couple of questions around your keynote yesterday with the demo of OpenAI writing Trimble code. Guy Tartakovsky and Alex Zukin
both brought this up. And is there a broader opportunity to build sort of a no-code, drag-and-drop AI-based solution to expand TAM opportunities?
And kind of how are you thinking about maybe even monetizing an AI-based product?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well, I mean, I think to address the specific example you gave, I am a big fan of low-code and no-code solutions. That's why we built Studio,
that's why we have Functions. Like there's a lot of different ways that gets expressed already in our product. But I think that there's a tremendous
opportunity to continue growing that area because I think code should fundamentally -- building, I should say, should be accessible to a wide
variety of builders inside of a company.

And you don't need to necessarily be 1 of the 30 whatever million professional developers who are out to build things, especially relatively
straightforward things. And so I'm a big fan.

I'd like to say there's 3 types. There's low-code no-code and yo code, just for the people who love to write code. So I'm a fan of that. Now whether
AI is going to be the thing that does that, it's very early days. And people since GPT-3 came out, there have been people experimenting as we did
on stage with the idea that GPT-3 might be able to write code. And look, it can pull off a few simple tricks today. But I think even the folks at OpenAI
would tell you that like, look, this is not ready for prime time and probably won't be for a very long time. But it can pull off a few interesting tricks.

And so where it goes, nobody knows exactly yet. But the idea of actually unlocking the ability to build low-code or no-code solutions is definitely
something that we're very interested. And if it turns out that some advanced machine learning is able to take some simple things and pull them
off-the-shelf and put them together, that will be really neat. But I think we're probably still fairly long ways off from that, to being like building
compelling business solutions.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right. Next kind of set of topics. There's a few questions here that I will not inundate you with all at once, but it's around IoT. So from Meta
Marshall, with increasing evolution towards customer engagement, how does IoT fit into that vision? Are those generally disparate customer sets?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
The IoT world and the customer engagement world are a little bit different from each other. First of all, you've got sort of different types of developers.
There's sort of the more hardware, e-oriented folks, which is different from kind of pure software folks. The development life cycles are different.
When you write software for some cloud service, you kind of write code, you put it through your test suite, it looks good, it might go out that day
or the next day or maybe a week later. Or if you're an early startup, you just push it out live in a minute.

And so whereas when hardware, you do your prototyping and then you get it just right and then it gets sent off for design and manufacturing and
production and distribution, and so a very different ball game.

But the fundamental similarity in the way in which we're using some of our core competencies here to solve a different set of problems is: number
one, obviously, with developers; number two, is abstracting tremendously complex systems, whether with the super SIM, it's the global network
of carriers that you might have to interop with your solution and to like get it under those networks and to do the certification, and all that kind of
stuff, or to strike economic deals with all those different carriers, let alone kind of optimizing it over time and making using software to drive it to
be more and more efficient over time. That's something we've been doing for 12 years with our super network for voice and messaging and to be
able to do it again for IoT is just really leveraging a lot of the competencies we already have.

And then the second thing is enabling innovation by lowering the barrier, making it easier for folks to do this kind of work, really making better
products emerge, letting new use cases emerge that might not have emerged otherwise. And that's really at the core.

And the way I think about it, if we started Twilio 12 years ago with voice and then messaging and then chat and then video, and what that led us
to the doorstep of is the next great opportunity in customer engagement, IoT is like starting the next platform. And we launched our IoT product
several years ago, and that was like the 2008 moment for that world.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And as we continue to grow the IoT product road map, I think we're going to continue to see, we're going to be able to look at how customers are
using our IoT products, what challenges arise, what they have to go build on top of us. And ultimately, the business solutions they're trying to solve,
and that will enable us to continue growing in this IoT footprint.

And IoT is -- it's a nice market today, but it is still at its infancy. And I think that when most people think about IoT, they think of like their home and
they think of they're like, I'm staring right now at an Internet-connected air purifier because I'm here in San Francisco where the air is bad today.
I'm looking at my Internet-connected air quality monitor, you can see a trend here. That's what a lot of us think about when you think about IoT.

But really, the biggest opportunity in IoT are a lot of these industrial use cases like automating factories or making our cities more efficient or
transportation use cases. And actually, there's a strong case to be made that IoT is going to be a big part of negating climate change because when
you are able to track conditions out in the real-world and adjust accordingly, you can actually make a lot more efficient use of resources. And we've
already seen that.

I don't know if you remember a couple of years ago, when we announced super SIM, we had the company that was doing the Internet-connected
garbage dumpsters. And it was kind of a funny product to launch with. But when you think about it, they're able to make the garbage pickup routes
a lot more efficient because it's actually measuring if there's garbage in the bins and if the trash needs to get empty. And so there's a lot of these
use cases out there.

So I still believe IoT is the very infant stages of its -- of this market. And in particular, what we found, and I say we build one thing, and that just leads
us to the next problem that we can solve and the next, we provided the connectivity solution with our super SIM. And of course, we have the
narrowband product as well that provides lower battery and much longer life solutions and low bandwidth and low-cost solutions. And then that
led us to understand, yes, we love the connectivity, but we're going to be spending the next year, just trying to get the firmware to boot up and
like building all the stuff in the guts of the device. And that's what led us to launch the Microvisor product that we launched, which drastically
simplifies the building, debugging, remote supporting and remote update deployment capability for IoT developers, which I think removes a big
stumbling block that a lot of companies have to getting a product into market. And so yet another great opportunity that our customers have
shown us.

And so I think about that as being the next big market, and we think that can be huge. While most of the thrust of the company is in customer
engagement and the communications underneath it, we have this great new initiative that's been running to tackle the emerging IoT market. We
can't wait to see what the world builds with it.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Next question from Mike Walkley. With COVID-19 accelerating company's digital transformation plans, is Twilio seeing a change in customer
usage patterns? And is this leading to a shift in investment priorities. So what are your key focus areas of investment over the next 12 months,
considering that we -- as we talked about, we were a little bit behind on our investment plans for this year in light of COVID?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. It's funny. I mean if you imagine like a nuclear power plant, like dashboard in front of us when COVID started, you would have had every
dialogue going some way or another. Some of them going way up, some going down, some going sideways, some of them blowing up, like it's a
wacky year through all the usage patterns in the flux. Some companies where we saw usage patterns going through the roof. Other companies
and other industries, you saw like declining massively. You saw net new use cases coming about. New products like video taking on a whole new
set of use cases and growing faster than we've ever seen it grow before.

And so of course, that has impacted our investments. Some products, we are investing in scale and growth and things like that. Other ones, you
see different features and capabilities that might be needed for the changing world. And so sometimes there's road maps that change to address
that. Like, I know our Flex team invested a lot of cycles this year to make sure that the contact tracing use case would be successful on Flex. And

                                                                                                                                                                             
 that's just like an interesting example that, I think, has more to do with pride that we could play a role in contact tracing and helping the world
open up again as opposed to being a long term.

God, I hope we are not doing contact tracing for many years in the future. I'll put it that way. But sort of impacted our road maps and -- but I think
that what you're seeing, like, these aren't major deviations. It's not like we were going in one direction. We were going north and suddenly, we had
to go south. This was the path that we were already on.

As for our customers, they were already on most of these paths, it's just priority shifted. And when the priority shifted, our customers and a lot of
these projects for customer engagement took on a lot new life and a lot more vigor and had urgency to them. Well, then, obviously, we're there
to help our customers. And for the most part, we have the product that our customers have needed. We were fortuitous in the fact that we rolled
out HIPAA compliance and the ability to sign BAAs just prior to COVID landing, and that had been something we've been working on for, gosh, at
least 12, 18 months before the time we launched it, that's a big lift.

And so being able to support those kind of workloads. But we did accelerate the HIPAA road map after COVID to enable even more products, to
be under the HIPAA compliance umbrella as a result of COVID.

So yes, we've accelerated some of these efforts. I would say it's not like a left turn in any way. It's more an organic, like refiguring of some of our
priorities and road maps. But all stuff that I would say is the right things for us to be focused on for the long term as our customers are accelerating
their own plans, in customer engagement. And we're asking ourselves, how do we support them? How do we get this business? How do we forge
new and more strategic relationships with these customers because these projects are so urgent and critical for them. Let's be there for them. Let's
be the trusted partner, and that will open the door to even more business as time goes on, and I'm excited to do that.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Our next question is from Anouk Dey at Endurance -- or sorry, at Durable. 2 years into Flex, what have you learned? Would you rather go
deeper into Flex or focus your time specifically on introducing another application?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Anouk. It's -- I mean, I think the answer is it's both, right? We're always -- we put a lot of focus and energy onto our existing products.
And Flex is still very early in its life cycle, right? It's a huge market. And the product is off to a fantastic start. We've got great customers on it.

And there's, of course, still a lot of building that we're going to keep doing. And at some point, when I spend my time, I tend to focus a lot on getting
the directional energy right. So very early on in Flex before we launched it, or in the very early days. It was in alpha or beta or whatever it was, I'd
spend a lot of time with the team to figure out like, okay, what does it mean to be a Flex? What does it mean to be a programmable contact center?
What does that concept even mean? How are we going to fulfill on that promise to build great APIs that allow developers to do their work while
still developing something that feels like a solution when you stand it up?

And so we got a lot of those things right, I believe, in the first generation, because we spent a lot of time. And now the team is taking a lot of
direction from customers and hearing feedback and building a lot of those features that customers need. But the really important bones that you
need to get right at the beginning, I feel like we did with Flex. And so that means that I'm able to spend a little less time than I've spent with Flex
in the very early days, and I get to focus on a variety of other things. And at any point in time, there's a variety of things that we're working on that
we think could be interesting. There's always a bunch of things we're working on. It turned out they may be nothing. And we may never launch
them. And then there's other things working on that we think could be big opportunities. And so that's how I like to spend my time is to dial up
my time in the early days, at the inception phase when you're making sort of key decisions that you'll live with for the next decade or two. And
then as we hatch something, we're able to spend less time because customers often help you guide the road map from there.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
All right. Our next question is from Brent Bracelin at Piper Sandler, titled Video Killed the Radio Star.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Nice.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Video is really taking a hit in the midst of the pandemic with prolific new use cases.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Hold on. I've got a new -- I've got like a new setup here as so many people do for their like Zoom stuff, and I've got a button here, hold on. I don't
know if you can hear it. I can hear it.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Yes, it's coming through.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Did I hit the right button? Was it the applause button?

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
It was the laughter button.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
The laughter button. Sorry, I meant the -- I didn't mean to laugh at you, but I meant to applaud you. That's a great -- I love that, Video Killed the
Radio Star. Okay. Let's move on.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
So we've seen prolific new use cases in telehealth apps powered by Twilio. It comes a couple of years after the first introduction of the video API.
So how important is the new WebRTC Go API in further accelerating video consumption on the Twilio platform? And do you look at this as one of
the bigger new product announcements? Or if not, what do you think is one of the bigger new product announcements?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean I think as I talked about -- yes, I went through some of these earlier, so I won't totally rehash it. I think WebRTC Go is a great product.
Because I want to onboard many developers who might go look at WebRTC is just this thing that's already built into the browsers and say, well,
that's all I need.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Like I've talked to so many customers through the years who we've said, oh, you should use our video product like, well, WebRTC is free. And I'm
like -- but we tell them like, you know all the hard things you're going to be dealing with over the years. If you succeed, like there's a lot of rough
corners to that thing, all the browser versions you have to test. All the network conditions you have to account for, all of the instrumentation and
visibility into what's happening that you will be flying blind with that you won't have. So when customers right into your support, the video didn't
work, and you're like, well, I don't know why, why don't you restart your computer, right? Like there's all these things that we've solved and there's
always this tension between. Well, but it's free. So let's -- we'll get started with it. And so what I like is that we've resolved that tension or made it,
so like, look, there's a product that supports you in adopting this free technology.

And the reason -- it's for you, by the way, I should preface this. When you do a one-to-one call between like, let's say, 2 web browsers, or 2 mobile
devices or whatever it is using WebRTC, like you're not using pretty much any centralized infrastructure. There's very little by way of like resource
consumption going on in a server somewhere. There's like the bandwidth is really just your like home Internet connection or whatever. It's not
really using resources. And so like it's kind of by its very nature free, and that's why it makes sense that like, yes, well, that shouldn't cost anything.
That's like charging me for air, which actually I would pay for in San Francisco right now.

But like -- so it makes sense. Like I don't want to -- like I wouldn't argue with a developer saying, no, no, no, like the air shouldn't be free. But what
I will say is there's all these hard things you then have to go solve for, and that's what our product wraps around the sort of core technology of the
Internet now.

And so what I like with what we've done is we tried a great on-ramp. We made it so developers don't have to pick between well, WebRTC is free,
but Twilio has solved all these problems. They kind of get the best of both worlds. They kind of get a light version of our product. And for the
one-to-one use cases, it is free like as it should be, basically. And I think what that will do is provide a great on-ramp. I think many more developers
were getting exposed to Twilio. I think that some of them will then realize that they should buy these other resources that surround the product
and pay for those. And then you get others who will say, ""Oh, I started with 1:1 use case, but then I realized I needed a 2:1 or 3:1, or a 5-way or a
10-way or a 50-way, and then there's a great -- okay, great, that's an easy transition into our other products, which those other use cases, by the
way, do use server resources, do use our bandwidth. So there is a cost. Whether we bear it or the customer tries to go build it themselves, somebody
is bearing a hard cost to serve those use cases, and that's where we saw even harder problems for our customers and where it's a really great set
of use cases.

So I think that WebRTC Go finally resolved some of the tension between, well, there's a sort of free thing that's just kind of built into the Internet
at this point, as opposed to a vendor solution, which costs money, but it solves a bunch of problems. We've kind of resolved that tension now. And
that I think will net us just a much bigger set of developers using Twilio, which will lead to great things.

And as far as the other products, I mean, I kind of rehashed them before. I'm particularly excited, I think Frontline is neat because it opens up a
whole new audience. And we see a lot of customers like Nike, building this on top of either Flex or some people are building on top of Conversations.
And before we had Conversations, a lot of people have kind of built it themselves and in their own ways. And so I think this is really solving a
problem that we've seen across many, many industries to provide a way for those frontline workers to digitally engage with customers, whether
it's those delivery drivers or the restaurant workers or the field service technicians, like there's so many different variations of people who aren't at
a desk who are interacting with you from a company that now we've got a great solution for. So I'm excited about that.

I found the right button, you want to hear it?

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Yes.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
It's funny I can't hear it, but I assume you all can.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Yes, we can. Next question is from Michael Turrin. The -- Event Stream's announcement grabbed our attention. Can you expand on the sets of data
that Twilio collects, the value of that data -- that data can provide your customers in ways that you can effectively monetize that, whether it's event
streams or cross-channel orchestration or some other application.

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
So Event Streams, I feel like we're finally working with customers, figured out the right starting point to help customers get value out of all the
engagement data that Twilio generates as a result of how customers are using Twilio across all of these different channels. And so that's really the
first step.

And I don't want to go too far into the future. But like this is, I would say, the beginning of a road map where we are helping customers to make
sense of their engagement data, about things customers are saying to them or what they're saying to their customers and starting to help customers
use that data to make smarter decisions, whether it's about which channels are working, which messages are working or which channels customers
prefer to use, really bringing all that data together into a feed that allows them to consume it, make sense of it, is the first step. And we listen to
customers and let them guide the way for how we can take that product and continue to expand it over time to get more and more value for our
customers out of the engagement data that Twilio sees.

And you can see -- I think we said in the investor presentation that we powered -- was it close to 1 trillion human interactions, right? There's a lot
of data about how companies are talking to customers. And most companies don't even have a way to look at all their own communications in
one spot that will make use of it. So the first step is trying to give them a way to actually get a handle on all that data.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. A question from Alex Zukin. Jeff, you guys have laid out a great framework for both high-growth and long-term margin targets. But I guess,
at what size of revenue do you feel it's appropriate to start putting up some good operating margin leverage and even getting into the double
digits?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
Thank you for the question. Not a -- maybe a new question. Look, I think it's the same thing that we've really said all along. We do believe there's
a great long-term model here with 20%-plus operating margins and 60-plus percent gross margins, all those things. But what we are doing is
investing for growth. This is a huge market opportunity.

I think that the engagement, whether it's communications or the software engagement is one of the largest, if not the largest opportunities in
enterprise software. And so when you're looking at an opportunity this big, you are not just inclined, you almost feel obligated to invest to really
capture this opportunity.

And so we remain focused on growth. That is our main priority. We are not a company that invests like at all costs. We are prudent with our
investments. We make wise investments. I think like some of the stuff we've talked about, like the investments in go-to-market that we've made
over the past several years are working very nicely. And so we keep a close eye on whether those investments are the right ones. And we continue
to invest, and we see a tremendous opportunity to play the long game here and to win this world of customer engagement. And so that's what
we're doing.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So I don't want to give you a time frame or a dollar amount like because, to me, that's not how I look at it. I look at it as we have an opportunity to
unlock growth outcomes for a long period of time because we have a huge market and a very big opportunity ahead of us, and customers illuminating
a path to continue to have elevated growth. And that's what we want to do.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR
Great. I think we'll do one more question to wrap things up, and it comes in from Derrick Wood at Cowen. Twilio has been a big champion of build
versus buy. George spoke to how some customers had existing solutions that chose to rip and replace with Twilio because of the additional
functionality and customization that can be built. So do you think COVID is becoming an accelerant for this build versus buy way of doing things?
And is this something that could resonate up to the CIO level?

Jeffrey Lawson - Twilio Inc. - Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO
I think that -- I think there's 2 big trends happening. First is that engagement needs to be built to some extent. If you think about like a lot of let's
say, B2B companies or even like back end systems, like maybe an HR system, like standardization is of great value. So buying an off-the-shelf solution
and then getting best practices built into it is a value that you get actually when you buy something that's like a bought product. But when it comes
to engaging with your customers, especially if you're, say, like a B2C company, that engagement is really how you differentiate.

So imagine your bank or your -- an airline or whatever, pick your industry. And they've all bought the same solution, plug it in, then in the eyes of
their customer, the experience is undifferentiated.

And so eventually, a digital disruptor comes along and builds something that really listens to customers, here's what they need, iterates on it at
the pace of software, deploying updates all the time and is really innovating, well customers will start to flock towards that. And that's why I say
it's not build versus buy, it's build versus die. Because the company who's able to listen to its customers and be agile and solve customer problems
because they have that muscle, like those are the companies that history has shown tend to win.

And so I think more and more -- and that was kind of the hypothesis that we had back in 2008 when we started the company, and I think it's largely
played out, right? You see some of the biggest companies in the planet, legacy companies have been around for 100 years or hiring armies of
developers and building software practices and competing in this new digital frontier.

And the second thing I'll say is that -- the second thesis or whatever is that agility is key to that. Because agility is the ability to take new information,
a changing market, a changing competitive dynamics, changing customer preferences and to turn it into new solutions and turn it into new ideas.
And that agility is what is needed in this digital era because the pace of business, obviously, is accelerating so much.

But what COVID has shown us is that the value of agility and the value of being able to see a problem and have the muscle to be able to go solve
it by building something is so important, because that was a muscle that was needed by nearly every company this year as they had to reinvent
themselves to a new set of conditions in the world and respond and build their way out. And so that's why it's so exciting to be where we are in
this moment is because, I think it was clear to most companies before that you can't just buy everything and expect to have a differentiated outcome,
you need to build. And you don't build everything. You build the things that customers care about.

But if you don't -- I think what you're seeing in COVID, by the way, is a bifurcation of the companies who really had like zero muscle in this regard.
I think a lot of those companies are the ones that you see are not making it this year. And the companies that had been investing in digital
transformations and have been building software development teams and have been focused on agility in adopting platforms like Twilio, those
are the ones that when COVID hit picked up their tools and started building. And those are the ones -- all those calls, that I was getting that weekend
of March 13, that I talked about in my keynote yesterday, those are the companies who were like, situation's changed, new reality we're facing.
We're building -- can you connect me to someone? We need some help or some advice or whatever it is. Those are the companies that are going
to thrive.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And I would go so far as to say that I think those companies are much -- it's a really bad thing to say in some ways, but like they're almost better off
because of COVID, because it forced them to sharpen their thinking and sharpen their pencils. And like John Donahoe was saying yesterday, they
had digital. And then suddenly, they were thrust into a 100% digital business. And they were prepared for it. And now they're even more prepared
for what's coming in terms of digital engagement, building those relationships and digital competition.

If digital is the competitive battlefield, if you will, then those companies that had the muscle and used it this year and accelerated those plans are
now, in some ways, in an even better spot than they might have been if it was like the business as usual world. And so -- and we're happy to be
partnering and working with those customers every day.

Andrew Zilli - Twilio Inc. - VP of IR

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Bang & Olufsen Interim Report First Quarter 2020/'21. (Operator Instructions)

Speakers, please begin.

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So hello, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Today I will start by going through the highlights of the quarter and provide an update on
how we are progressing and unfolding our strategy. Afterwards, Nikolaj Wendelboe, our CFO, will take you through our financials in more detail.
Then I will go through the outlook for 2021 before we open up for questions. Our Head of Marketing, Digital and Customer Experience, Christian
Birk, is also with us today and will take part in the Q&A session later.

So if we move to Slide #4. For the first time in 2 years, we reported revenue growth. The revenue increased by 11% in local currency to DKK 462
million in Q1. The EBIT was negative DKK 39 million, and free cash flow was negative DKK 62 million. This was a significant improvement of the DKK
90 million and DKK 144 million, respectively, compared to last year. COVID-19 continued to impact our business as well as consumer behavior. We
saw an increased demand for home entertainment products, while travel retail was negatively impacted by the decline in domestic and international
travel.

A key element in our strategy is a stronger focus on core markets and the monobrand channel. The focus yielded results in Q1 as we delivered solid
growth in our monobrand channel, especially in our core markets. Our own eCom platform delivered strong growth in Q1 as it increased by 115%
compared to last year. This was also a result of our efforts to strengthen our digital presence to cater for the changes in consumer behavior we saw
in the quarter.

Launching new innovative products is a key priority. And in Q1, we successfully launched 3 new products as well as 2 new brand collaborations.
These have been well received in the market and supported by more focused localized sales and marketing plans, which I also will come back to
in the strategy section.

An important part of making the company profitable again is our cost program launched in March, and with a targeted annual savings of DKK 175
million. I'm pleased that this program is progressing as planned. Following the rights issue, we got into Q2 with a cash position of close to DKK 500
million, which allows us to continue to execute on our strategy and get through the COVID-19 crisis.

We maintain our outlook with revenue of approximately DKK 2.2 billion, EBIT before special items of approximately negative DKK 100 million and
free cash flow of approximately negative DKK 200 million. So if we please move on to the next page.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In our strategy, we have identified 8 focus markets where we want to win before scaling our business. In Q1, we delivered strong progress in those
markets driven by our monobrand network and higher demand for home entertainment among consumers. In the 6 focus markets in Europe, we
saw a revenue increase of 6%. In line with our strategy, we delivered strong growth in the monobrand network, where revenue increased by 28%
compared to last year and sell-out increased by 15% in the same period.

The difference between reported growth and sell-out growth is related to last year's efforts to reduce inventory and not due to inventory buildup
in the channel. Looking at sell-in versus sell-out, we can see that retail inventory in Q1 has been relatively stable.

To strengthen strategy execution, we have added resources and new capabilities to our market organizations, especially within multi-brand and
e-tail. This will allow us to strengthen our performance in the coming quarters. Our marketing budget has been reallocated to our 8 focus markets.
And overall, we have had much more integrated and controlled go-to-market approach in local markets.

Our 2 Asian-focused markets also reported growth with a 25% increase in revenue compared to last year. It is, however, important to highlight that
growth was impacted by orders originally expected in Q4 last year, sell-out from our monobrand stores was 7% higher than last year. To cater for
the changes in consumer behavior, we refocused our sales execution towards home entertainment products, which also resulted in an increase in
revenue for Flexible Living and Staged products.

So if we move to the next page. This year, we plan to launch more than 10 new and upgraded products, and we remain on track to deliver that. In
Q1, we launched the first 3 products: E8 Sport; our new headphone, Beoplay H95; and a TV stand designed for our soundbar, Beosound Stage. In
addition, we launched limited additions of Beoplay E8 Sports with Swiss running brand, On, and a super limited version of Beosound Edge and
Beoplay E8 Sport with Fernando Alonso. The products have been well received, and we have seen a good traction on them, and I will elaborate a
little bit more on them on the next pages.

If we move on to the next page. In Q1, we entered into several new partnerships to support brand building and add scale to our business. In June,
we announced that we will go into gaming. To do it effectively, we are teaming up with Xbox and partnering with one of the world's leading esports
and gaming organization, Astralis. The latter will not only help build awareness of the Bang & Olufsen brand, but also enable us to leverage on
Astralis' competencies and insights from the industry to support the development of our future gaming portfolio. Our upcoming gaming headset
is planned for the Autumn 2021.

We also continue to position our products' brand ambassadors. As mentioned, we entered into collabs with running brand On, and 2-time F1 World
Champion and double 24-hour Le Mans winner, Fernando Alonso. We will continue to pursue similar brand collab opportunities in the coming
quarters to help amplify our brand and expand our consumer base.

When we present our strategy in April, we also highlighted that there were important growth opportunities we could pursue. One of them was
distribution partnerships in the U.S. to scale our business, and we executed on that in Q1. In August, we announced that we were teaming up with
Verizon to strengthen our coverage in the market. Through their website, we are now selling our soundbar, Beosound Stage, E8 Sports, Beoplay
H9 and Beosound A1 second generation.

Finally, this morning, we have announced that we will expand our collaboration with our digital transformation partner, Publicis Sapient. We have
already been working with them on our e-commerce platform, but now extend our partnership to include go-to-market campaigns, digital services
and launch our products. In short, the aim is to accelerate and scale our efforts efficiently in order to create demand for our products and bring
new services to our customers.

If we move to the next page. Another key element in our house has been to reignite our brand marketing. The 3 product launches shown here on
the page are examples on how we have refreshed our brand expression and how the marketing is now targeting specific consumer segments. The
new Beosound A1 is targeting the NC consumer segment on the products -- and the products are now much more in focus. Beosound A1 was
launched in Q4 last year and is performing very well also in Q1.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 E8 Sport was our first product as we entered the sports category, which was further supported by the collaboration I just mentioned on the previous
page with On and Fernando Alonso. Finally, the Beoplay H95 headphone has been well received. And here, we have also applied new tactics to
work with influencers to connect with our target audiences. To create hype around the launch, we made H95 -- sorry, we made 95 special versions,
marked from 1 to 95 in celebration of our 95th birthday, and we offered them in advance of the official launch. We sold them all out in a couple of
hours.

If we move to the next page. Because of our 95-year history and unique capabilities within design and craftmanship, we decided to leverage this
with the Classic and Bespoke program. During 3daysofdesign, an important annual design event in Denmark, we presented our first pilot project
with the classic program. With the Classics program, we aim to refurbish and reimagine some of our most iconic products. The first release will be
the Beogram 4000 series. We're updating it for contemporary use while maintaining the integrity and timeless spirit at its core.

We also have our Bespoke program, and we have announced the Beosound 1 Factory 5 edition in sapphire blue. We have only made 10 units in
this unique colorway, which has been developed at our owner renowned Factory 5.

Please turn to the next page. We have shown this slide previous -- in previous earnings calls, but I want to reemphasize how we intend to unfold
our strategy. Currently, we are at the first wave of fixing the basics and making the company profitable again. In Q1, we continue to see good
progress with our strategy execution despite the challenges with corona.

And with that, I would like to turn over to you, Nikolaj, who will take you through the financial development.

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Thank you, Kristian. Please turn to Page 12. As Kristian said, we have delivered our first revenue growth in 2 years and also delivered improvements
in our gross margin and EBIT margin. The latter, not least, supported by the progress in our cost reduction program. Revenue increased by 11%
compared to Q1 last year. The growth was driven by higher demand for Staged and Flexible Living products, which increased by 88% and 55%,
respectively. On-the-go declined by 37%, mainly related to lower travel activity and sale of end-of-life products in Q1 last year of approximately
DKK 90 million.

Based on our like-for-like sell-out data, sell-out was overall increasing with 1% looking across channels, but with improved sell-out from our
monobrand channel, which increased by 10%. The multibrand channel experienced a decline of more than 20% in sell-out, partly related to the
decline in travel retail, but also reflecting our strategic focus on the monobrand channel in Q1.

Looking at these growth rates, it's important to remember that we last year depleted retailer inventory and retailer sell-out was therefore higher
than sell-in in Q1 last year.

The gross margin increased by 6.1 percentage points compared to Q1 last year, which was mainly related to a shift in demand towards Stage and
Flexible Living products. The gross margin from Staged and Flexible Living was also improved by product mix within the categories. The gross
margin in On-the-go category was impacted by sales of end-of-life products and a negative effect from allocation of product-related capacity costs,
which has a larger impact on revenue declines.

The EBIT margin before special items was negative by 8.5%. This was 22.3 percentage points better than Q1 last year, driven by the higher revenue,
better gross margin as well as lower capacity costs. The decline in capacity cost was mainly driven by a cost reduction program, where we realized
DKK 31 million in this quarter, and we are on track to deliver our DKK 175 million target when fully implemented in 2021, '22. The savings realized
in Q1 was mainly related to headcount reductions and non-product-related spend. Savings impacted both administration cost, development cost,
distribution and marketing costs as well as cost of goods sold.

Please turn to the next page. As mentioned by Kristian, increased demand for home entertainment had a positive impact on the Staged product
category across all regions and the Flexible Living product category in Asia. Travel retail negatively impacted multi-brand in all regions.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In EMEA, revenue grew by 14% in local currency. Growth was mainly driven by the monobrand channel. In the 6 core markets, the monobrand
channel delivered a 15% year-on-year sell-out growth. In addition, last year was impacted by inventory depletion and thus lower sell-in and sell-out.
This balance has also been normalized this year.

The growth in the Staged category was driven by both existing speakers and TVs, like Beovision Eclipse as well as from Beovision Harmony and
Beosound Stage, which were launched in Q2 last year. The decline in On-the-go was due to sell-in of end-of-life products last year, which was not
repeated this year, partly offset by higher revenue from Bluetooth speakers with the new Beosound A1 launched in Q4 last year as the main driver.

Americas declined by 3% in local currency. The decline was related to the multibrand channel, partly offset by higher revenue from monobrand,
especially the U.S. was impacted by corona lockdowns in Q1. In Asia, revenue increased by 17% in local currency, driven by both Staged and Flexible
Living, which increased by 132% and 162%, respectively. The decline in On-the-go was, among others, due to last year being supported by end-of-life
products. Also here, partly offset by higher revenue from Bluetooth speakers.

Brand partnering and other activities was at the same level as last year. The development was impacted by effects of COVID-19. Car manufacturing
has been low during Q1 and hence also installation of audio systems. This development also impacted the production of aluminum components
for third parties in the quarter. On the other hand, COVID-19 had an effect on working from home, an impact on PC sales increasing our license
income from HP.

Please turn to the next page. Our capacity costs declined by 16% in Q1 compared to Q1 last year. We saw cost decline in all 3 cost categories. Our
development costs declined by 14%. This was due to a combination of higher capitalization and lower amortization. However, the incurred
development costs were 8% higher and reflected our focus on product development, which is a key part of our strategy.

Our distribution and marketing costs declined by 16% compared to last year. Part of the reduction was related to the cost reduction program. We
also had a more focused digital marketing activation relative to physical presence due to COVID-19. Therefore, retail marketing spend was lower,
and we also saw delays in development of retail stores. Finally, administration costs declined by DKK 5 million or 15%, which were related to the
cost reduction program.

Please turn to the next page. CapEx was DKK 3 million higher than in Q1 last year. Investments were primarily driven by intangible assets related
to development of new products and technology platforms and also driven by capitalizations. Our net working capital increased by DKK 24 million,
mainly driven by lower payables. In Q4 last year, we postponed some payments into Q1 this year as part of our working capital management to
preserve cash before the rights issue was completed. These payables have been paid in Q1 this year.

Free cash flow was negative DKK 62 million, which was DKK 144 million better than Q1 last year. EBITDA was positive DKK 5 million compared to
negative DKK 74 million in Q1 last year. The negative free cash flow was therefore mainly related to working capital development and cash flow
from investments. Our cash position increased to DKK 497 million, driven by the right issue completed in July, which raised DKK 357 million in net
proceeds.

Please turn to Page 16. Working capital management continues to be a very high focus for us. Inventory declined to DKK 413 million and was
reduced by a further DKK 44 million in Q1. Trade payables was reduced to DKK 327 million, the decrease was partly related to the postponement
of payments, as mentioned before.

Finally, our trade receivables increased to DKK 331 million, mainly due to higher sales compared to Q4 last year, but partly offset by lower overdue
receivables. The reduction in overdue receivables is very encouraging, but we are mindful that new COVID-19 lockdowns can change this picture
fast, so we're carefully monitoring the development.

And with that, I would like to hand it back to Kristian.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Thank you, Nikolaj. Before opening up for questions, I would just like to briefly go through the outlook and highlights. So if we move to the next
page. The outlook for 2021 is unchanged compared to the outlook presented in our Annual Report on July 7. We saw good progress on strategy
execution in Q1. As I stated before, the circumstances related to COVID-19 are extraordinary. It is worth restating that the outlook has a high
uncertainty due to the lack of transparency arising from COVID-19.

The outlook for 2021 depends on numerous factors, including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in relevant markets, impact on the economies
in countries around the world and the financial and operational impact on our business partners. Based on the balanced view of potential scenarios
for COVID-19, our outlook for the financial year 2021 is, therefore, maintained. Revenue of approximately DKK 2.2 billion, EBIT before special items
of approximately negative DKK 100 million and free cash flow of approximately negative DKK 200 million.

We maintain our plan to launch more than 10 new and upgraded products, whereof 3 products were launched in Q1 and one has already been
launched for Q2. The EBIT before special items and free cash flow is further impacted by the cost reduction program we launched in March.

Use of government relief packages in '19/'20 will adversely impact cash flow throughout 2021. We also mentioned in our previous communication
we have considered the impact of an adverse scenario and an alternative scenario where the implications of COVID-19 are less severe. These are
described in the Q1 report.

So move to Page 19. So to summarize, we are pleased with the progress we made in Q1. We achieved double-digit growth driven by monobrand
channel, especially in our focus markets and also driven by product launches and demand pattern for more home living products.

We see the results as evidence to our solid strategy execution by the whole organization and our partners and the strength of our diverse portfolio
of products. We also delivered DKK 31 million in savings as part of our cost reduction program in Q1, and I'm pleased that we are on track to deliver
on our target of DKK 175 million.

There's still a high uncertainty due to COVID-19, which will continue to impacting our business, consumers and societies around the world. But
after the rights issue completed in July, we are going into Q2 with a cash position of nearly SEK 500 million which means that we can continue
executing on the strategy.

Finally, before going to the Q&A, I just want to take the opportunity to say a big thank you to the whole B&O team and our partners. Everybody
has been working extremely hard to unfold the strategy during these uncertain times, and I'm very proud of the work that we have been doing.
So thank you very much. They have been definitely the key for our Q1 improvement.

So with that, I think we are ready for the Q&A.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Poul Jessen of Danske Bank.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
It's Poul Jessen. Can you hear me?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Yes, we can.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. No. I have several questions. First of all, you mentioned that the online sale was up 115%. I think on Q4, it was said that online was about 6%
of revenue. Can you say how much of the revenue now is online? That's one question.

And then using that to look into the upcoming or current quarter with the Christmas sales, do you have an idea of how much of total revenue now,
including third-parties, is being done online? I'm just getting -- trying to get an impression on what the risk is on social distancing and physical
store closings and so on. So if you can give some insight into that area.

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Poul, I will let Nikolaj take the first question, probably, and I'll give a stab at the second one myself. And maybe I'll start with the second one.

In our strategy, as you know, we have different ways to market with the monobrand, the multibrand and with our own e-commerce. Our multibrand
partners as well, as you know, have e-commerce platforms. And in the strategy, we said that we will focus, number one, on monobrands, which
we did in Q1, but also then in second wave go for more multibrand partners and we're building that out and expect to have more multibrand
partners in quarter 2 and also then have more e-commerce platforms from these multibrand partners and also have, of course, our own e-commerce
platform in addition to that.

So I feel we will be in a good shape to have coverage from eCom during quarter 2 and for the holiday season. And I'll leave to Nikolaj to answer the
more detailed question on the revenue numbers. So Nikolaj, over to you.

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Yes. So on the revenue side, Poul, all eCom is a little less than 5% of total revenue in Q1. But as Kristian rightfully say, when we add in the total mix
of what’s sold through retailers and e-commerce partners, then you are arriving at a higher number. We don't have the exact visibility into how all
mutual bank partners, for instance, divide the sale into whats going into physical and what's going into their eCom websites. But out of total
revenue, we are a good around 10 percentage points in Q1 for sure.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And then Kristian, you said that there would be more multibrand partners in the second quarter. Can you put some names around who has
been on-boarded on the multibrand side?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
We cannot do that before we announce it. But as you know, that was part of the strategy from the get-go as well. So we have been making progress
on that, and we will soon announce.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. Then they come here and there. A question on the gaming, where you announced the partnership with Astralis. As I recall it back in June
when you announced the partnership with Microsoft on the Xbox, then it was said that there would be a gaming product in the market at the Xbox
launch.

Now on the Astralis announcement, you say about that there will be headphones in the market in the Spring. Can -- I read that as there is some
delay in the product and both can you comment on what's happened here? And secondly, is that going to be a material impact on your full year
expectations that you are missing out on the Christmas and potentially 4, 5 months of revenue on that segment?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Let me start with that. First of all, we don't want -- as you know, my policy and principle is that I don't announce products nor product announcements
or whether products are delayed or not. But we -- when we build our portfolio up and we build our business up, there is always shifts in between
different opportunities, different channels and different products that have better opportunities.

Of course, we try to manage our numbers within -- with those difficulties or with those opportunities. It depends on how you see it and have the
flexibility to move between different things. So when we have, and if we have, delays, we don't want you to, of course, detect them. We don't want
the business to be dependent on that.

That's all I'm going to say on the delay question. So we try to mitigate and work around all of those always. And Birk will answer more specifically
on the Astralis partnership.

Christian Birk - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP and Head of Marketing, Digital & Customer Experience
Yes. Thanks for the question, Poul. So first of all, I think we are committed, as we said, going into gaming. We have the Astralis partnership, and we
have also Xbox, as we have announced. We don't, as Kristian said, disclose what that encompass in terms of products. But I think it's fair to say that
we want more than just products out of these partnerships. It's also a go-to-market impact and an actual messaging exercise that we want to drive
also from a channel perspective. So products is one side of the intent, but we have bigger intent on the overall partnership and gaming proposition.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And then the last one for me for now. On the cost-cutting program, DKK 31 million in the first quarter, just to get a clarification, the DKK 175
million, is that the savings you're going to get for the full year? Or is that the run rate leaving the fourth quarter?

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
So the DKK 175 million is full year impact when all initiatives are implemented. That's why we're saying there should be a full year impact we can
expect in '21, '22 when fully implemented. So the DKK 31 million is the quarterly impact that we have this quarter, specifically, which in principle
you can say we implemented, 1/4 of DKK 124 million then sort of as a guiding principle here.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So the run rate in the remaining 3 quarters on average should be closer to DKK 50 million?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
The run rate that we have on Q1 for DKK 31 million is an annual run rate of DKK 120-ish million, right? So -- but we're still implementing new things
in the program that will add to the DKK 175 million in fully annualized run rate when we are done.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So there will be a positive impact next year as well?

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
That's our expectation.

Operator
We've got one further question in the queue. (Operator Instructions)

The next question comes from the line of Niels Leth with Carnegie.

Niels Granholm-Leth - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Co-head of Research of Denmark & Financial Analyst
So I have a few questions. Let me take them -- a couple of them here. So could you talk about the effect of the Amazon Prime Day being delayed
from your fiscal Q1 into the fiscal Q2 period? Secondly, could you talk about your gross margin in your important EMEA region? So what would it
take for your gross margin to grow well above that 40%? Is it simply just a matter of higher sales? I'll stop there.

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So maybe I go first on Amazon Prime Day. So obviously, it happens when it happens, and we take part of some of them and may not take part of
other of these initiatives. So that's all I'm going to be able to say on that right now. And then I'll leave for Nikolaj to comment on the gross margin.

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Yes. So gross margin in EMEA. Well, first of all, I think you noticed that we are 6.2 percentage points up compared to Q1 last year. And that's, of
course, a combination of managing the channels and the partners better. We now have a sort of a healthy way of doing business with our partners,
where we moved away from selling with a lot of discounting. But we also have a newer product portfolio, of course, that increases margins and
relationship in the commercial terms with our partners.

But you're asking what does it take to bring it above 40, and I don't think we will sort of make a specific plan for that while we sit here. But of course,
gross margin is a combination of pricing your cost of goods sold and then, of course, the level of discounts and allowances and campaigns you're
running in the business.

So that's the 3 things that we are constantly working with. And I think we have initiatives going into looking at our COGS at the moment as a part
of the cost out program. And that will, of course, also impact gross margin positively over the coming years and quarters.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Niels Granholm-Leth - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Co-head of Research of Denmark & Financial Analyst
Okay. Great. Perhaps I could just take a couple of more questions. Could you update us on the status of your ASBIS collaboration? And also, could
you update us on the renewal of your contracts with HP and LG?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So ASBIS, we have signed up, we're working well together with them. Obviously, it takes a bit of time to transfer responsibilities and onboard all
the countries that they are present in. So I feel we are doing that in a good way and as fast as you can expect. They are not fully operational just
yet, but they are close of being so.

When it comes to our contract partners that we have in brand partnering and licensing, the contracts are, I mean, not up for renewal right now.
And then obviously, we are working together with our partners in this respect, HP and HARMAN. And we're constantly looking at opportunities
with them. And I don't think we see any reasons to believe that the contracts will not be renewed. But it's too early for that.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) So no one else has come forward. So I'll place you back. Please go ahead.

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So thank you everybody for joining today's call and all for your questions as well...

Operator
Sorry, sir. Sorry. You had Niels Leth from Carnegie to go ahead with that next question because no one else has joined the queue in front of them.

Niels Granholm-Leth - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Co-head of Research of Denmark & Financial Analyst
Okay. Great. Then I have a few more questions if time allows for that.

So my question would be, what proportion of your group sales comes from airport retailing? That's something that you highlight a couple of places
in your Q1 report. And also, could you talk about the performance in this quarter between the beginning of the quarter and towards the end of
the quarter? Was it stronger towards the end of the quarter or was it weaker towards the end of the quarter?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So maybe I'll take the second question first, and I'll let Nikolaj take the first question. So obviously, when we went -- if you go back even to Q4 when
we exited Q4 and went into Q1, it was a pretty tough situation. COVID just kind of starting to go away and stores starting to reopen.

When we look at the situation in the world right now, I think we are in a much better shape when we are leaving -- left Q1 and moving into Q2,
generally speaking, and that's all I'm going to say.

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Yes. So on travel retail, so travel retail is many things because you have travel retail stores in airports, of course. And they are down by 90%, something
like that, compared to what we would normally see. That channel is really, really having a difficult time at the moment.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 But then you also have retail that is travel-related but is done in sort of regular multibrand or monobrand stores because you buy your travel
accessory not necessarily in the airport. And that makes it difficult to sort of say what is travel-related sort of as a number, but we are quite confident
that the overall negative development that we see in a multibrand is also related to traveling, being down and having an impact on the sort of the
purchases that you see in multibrand that is normally travel-related.

So we won't give you sort of a travel number, but at least we can say that the airport stores are 90% down compared to last year, 9-0.

Niels Granholm-Leth - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Co-head of Research of Denmark & Financial Analyst
And how many stores do you have placed in airports?

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
I can't get -- I can't give you that number specifically right now. We can come back to that maybe at a different time.

Operator
And also, Poul -- sorry, yes, Poul Jessen from Danske Bank has rejoined the queue.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Actually, I thought it was registered before. But a few questions about the sourcing.

You mentioned that there has been some delay because of component issues on some of the products. Talking to at least European franchisees
also get reports that there were some issues during the summer, for instance, the A1 and also that I can see on your own home page that the H95
was -- in black, was very early sold out.

Can you comment on the sourcing and the planning towards the Christmas now also that your own inventories are coming down to levels from
before your recent crisis?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Thank you, Poul. Kristian here. You're right, and there is increased demand for certain components in the market, and we're working very, very
closely with our partners on securing components to make sure that we can supply for Q2.

So far, we have done well to secure that. We have -- just coming back to H95 question, and you see a longer lead time on some products. We have
had good demand on H95. We have had good demand on a few other products as well that have impacted lead times for those products. And
we're, of course, working hard to get back on more normal lead times that we had previously.

So there is some delays in the supply, but I don't expect that to have, at least the way it looks right now, any material impact on our quarter.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And then on China, there were the -- some issues at the end of the fourth quarter into this quarter by delays on postponement of purchases
from Chinese partners. How has that developed throughout the first quarter? Is that fully normalized now? Question also relates to one of your
                                                                                                                                                                             
 partners who had to cancel capital increase just last weeks, which should have been what was defined to go for working capital. Are there any
issues in the Chinese market on the normalization of your sell-in?

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
So if you take the Chinese partners, I think we're all working well with them. And like you correctly point out, sometimes you can't control how
orders fall in between different quarters. So we had a delay in quarter 4 into quarter 1. And then we actually had a little bit more into quarter 1 than
we expected this time.

So it sometimes falls in the quarter, sometimes it falls out of the quarter. But to my knowledge, at least, we have good working relations with them,
and the business is going well with them.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. And the final one from me on the trade receivables. You say that the overdue receivables has come down. They were quite high in the fourth
quarter. Can you give a number of how low they have got now?

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Yes. So our overdue trade receivables are actually down to what we call sort of pre-corona level. So we've seen actually a movement of almost DKK
40 million in the quarter of overdues coming down.

But I think it's also important for me to say that a lockdown or a sort of local lockdown in a country or in a city can change the picture quite fast.
But the Q1 development has been encouraging, definitely.

Poul Ernst Jessen - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Senior Analyst
So we are now down below DKK 100 million in overdue?

Nikolaj Wendelboe - Bang & Olufsen a/s - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Management Board
Yes. That I can confirm.

Operator
And as there are no further questions at this time, I'll hand back to our speakers for the closing comments.

Kristian Teär - Bang & Olufsen a/s - CEO & Member of the Executive Board
Okay. So I'll give it a second go now. And so thank you, everybody, for joining and for all your questions and all your support. And if you do have
any further questions, then please reach out to Martin and we will try to clarify. So I wish you all a good day. Thank you very much.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 9-month report for 2020 conference call. (Operator Instructions) I also must
advise that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, the 1st of October 2020. And without any further delay, I would now like to hand over the
call to your first speaker today, CEO, Helena Helmersson. Thank you. Please go ahead.

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Welcome to the telephone conference about the H&M group's 9 months and third quarter results
2020. With me today is our CFO, Adam Karlsson; and Head of Investor Relations, Nils Vinge.

I will start with a short summary of the third quarter and our focus going forward, and then we will be happy to answer your questions. You will
find the 9-month report on h&mgroup.com (sic) [hmgroup.com] Investor Relations.

Our recovery is going better than expected. This is the result of much appreciated collections and our rapid and decisive actions to counter the
negative impact of COVID-19, which is still affecting us. Our online growth remains strong and profitable and temporarily closed stores continued
to gradually reopen. With more full price sales than expected and strict cost control, we returned to profit already in the third quarter.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Our teams around the world have done an amazing job. And although the challenges are far from over, we believe that the worst is behind us and
that we are well placed to come out of the crisis stronger.

We will continue our agenda of sustainable, profitable transformation centered around the customer. COVID has fast tracked many of the changes
we saw happening in the market already before the outbreak, and this means that our focus will be on digitalization and omnichannel, speed and
flexibility and on sustainability and resilience.

More and more people have started to shop online during the pandemic. Our customers are showing us clearly that they value a convenient and
inspiring experience for stores and online interact and strengthen each other. The substantial investments that we made in recent years have been
very important for our recovery.

Now we are speeding up our transformation work further in order to meet our customers' expectations. This includes digital investments, store
portfolio optimization and channel integration.

To ensure that our offerings are relevant to customers and to improve availability in all channels, speed and flexibility will be even more important
in the future, particularly in the supply chain.

COVID-19 has also highlighted the importance of sustainability. Demand for good value, sustainable products is expected to grow in the wake of
the pandemic. Our customer offering is well positioned for this and H&M wants to make it possible for everyone to look and feel good.

We will continuously improve the assortment to make sure we offer our customers the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability.

Our drive to become circular and climate-positive is an important part of our sustainability work. It will enable us to gradually increase the share
of sustainable and renewable materials, and it will also benefit the development of new revenue streams.

Together with our accelerated transformation work, this will help build resilience and contribute to long-term profitability -- profitable growth for
the H&M group.

Thank you very much for listening, and now we are happy to take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) So our first question is from the line of Daniel Schmidt from Danske Bank.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. A couple of questions from me. Helena, when you state that the worst is behind us and that you are coming out of the crisis stronger, does
that sort of implicitly mean that you feel that you could be back on the trajectory that you were recording before COVID-19 as you go into 2021?
That's the first question.

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
The results of all the work we have done, and that we saw in the beginning of the year and also in the end of last year, clearly shows that we had
a momentum. And this is, of course, one of the parts that has helped us to recover more quickly now. And this is also the path that we are going
back to. And with all the learnings from the pandemic, we also see that we can accelerate some parts of our agenda going forward.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 What exactly will happen, of course, is very unpredictable also for us when it comes to, for example, footfall and the different scenarios related to
the pandemic. But we do see that how we have worked and try to stay flexible with, for example, cost control and also other parts of the agenda,
has definitely strengthened us for the future.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
All right. And then sort of jumping on to your guidance when it comes to net closings of stores next year, you're saying 250. Could you give or shed
some more light on sort of what regions? And do you foresee any extra costs associated to this? And your ability to capture sales from these closing
stores, sort of looking back in history, what's your track record?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
It's correct that we see a net closure of 250 stores, we believe, for next year. We clearly see that customers want to meet us in both channels and
in different channels. So our agenda to continue to integrate the channels going forward is really, really clear to us.

Part of that is obviously to optimize then the store network, and we will continuously then develop our stores as we have always done and how
that will look like the years to come is something that we work with continuously. At the same time, of course, we work on growing digitally and
in our online channels. But again, back to the importance of integrating the channels.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
And is it fair to believe that many of these 250 stores are close to loss-making or loss-making today that you plan to close during '21?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
As Helena says Daniel, the changing customer behavior obviously shifts the ability to earn money in some of the stores. So we're looking from it
market-by-market and assessing how do we optimize the store network in the best possible way to ensure that we, from an omni perspective,
both can drive top line and profitability. So of course, profitability on location level is part of that assessment.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
And typically, we don't close the most profitable stores.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Fredrik Ivarsson from ABG.

Fredrik Ivarsson - ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst
A couple of questions from me as well. Starting with cost control, you mentioned that, Helena, and how that has sort of accelerated throughout
the pandemic, and I'm curious how to think about maybe short-term Q4, but also looking into the coming years. Have you reached a lower level
medium-term, than you previously sort of thought that you could reach? That's my first question.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
When looking at what we have done during the crisis, of course, we see that we can be quite flexible with a big part of our costs. Part of this is us
being very decisive and acting fast in the crisis, which, of course, we have learned a lot from also moving forward. And part of this is related to more
crisis -- our crisis agenda and actions such as, for example, closing the fitting rooms, which is, of course, nothing that we would do if we were not
in a crisis.

Fredrik Ivarsson - ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst
Right. Okay. Second question, Helena. You mentioned the importance of speed and flexibility quite a few times. Does this imply a significantly
higher degree of proximity sourcing going forward?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Speed and flexibility will definitely be more important going forward. If looking at the whole supply chain, of course, we want to make sure that
the work we do is integrated, meaning from the ID of a product, of -- or of an assortment until it reaches the customers. So it more has to do than
with how we set up the network when it comes to, for example, distribution centers and obviously, how we change our processes also related to
tech. So it's more about that agenda that we think will be of great importance for speed and flexibility going forward.

Fredrik Ivarsson - ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst
That's clear. And last question, not too much related to Q4. But on Treadler that you launched quite a few months ago, and you've been live for a
while, just curious to hear about your initial learnings and how that has been received. And also what your expectations on that investment is for
the midterm?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
No, it's still quite early days, but Treadler is a very interesting initiative where we open up our supply chain and offer services to other companies
that also want to -- or have the vision to make their supply chain more sustainable.

So, so far, we're still learning a lot in discussions with potential customers and also trying to update that offer going forward. So yes, we see progress,
but it's quite early days to draw any kind of final conclusions. But we are, of course, very excited to see where this could lead us since we have such
a long experience from working with our supply chain.

Operator
The next question is from the line of Chiara Battistini from JPMorgan.

Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
First one would be on your gross margin into Q4. I was just wondering if you could explain us why the cost of markdown in Q4 should be actually
be higher than in Q3, especially given that then the impact from black -- from Cyber Monday will fall into the Q -- well, you are not comping against
that. Is it that reason? And also I was expecting to see actually negative external factors impacting Q4, given ForEx. Why are you actually guiding
for neutral impact on -- from external factors?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The second question, coming back to the net closures in 2021. Can you tell us a bit more about the kind of locations you're closing? Where they
are? And in what markets they will be concentrated? And also what kind of average store size you're closing? And what will that do to the average
store size of the group post closure?

And finally, I was wondering, on your loyalty scheme, how many members do you have now on the program? And can you talk a bit more about
how you're capitalizing on this program in terms of interaction with the consumer, maybe thinking about the product pipeline and overall, indeed,
engaging with the consumer from that?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Thank you, Chiara. That was a lot of questions. To make it easier for the listeners and for us, could you please take it one by one next time? But I
remember the first line -- the first question was the gross margin and markdowns, right? So that's...

Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
Yes, thank you. Sorry about that. Yes.

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Okay. Our assessment of the situation and then also, as reported, is the markdown pressure was less than previously anticipated for third quarter.
But also looking from a sequential point of view, fourth quarter is a lot less markdown. The level -- markdown level is a lot lower in quarter 4. So
we believe that we will have an overall slightly heightened level of markdowns throughout the quarter, but still far down below the activity we
had in the third quarter.

So our best assessment at this point is that it will proportionately increase more in fourth quarter, but sequentially come down.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
And then when it comes to store closures and store optimization, this is something we do market by market, of course. And to your specific question
of closures, I think the most -- highest number of closures will be mainly in the U.S. and Europe. And when it comes to openings, it's -- the most
prioritized will be Russia, Japan, South Korea and Eastern Europe.

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
When it comes to members and the loyalty program with the H&M brand, we now have around 90 million members. For us, this is a great way to
interact with customers in -- on a deeper level, meaning that we can build more relationships and also see and make sure that we engage with
customers so that they constantly also come back to us. So, of course, we are happy to see that the number has increased to around 90 million.

Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
If I just may follow-up on 2 of my questions. Just on the external factors impacting Q4. So you would confirm that the effect is actually neutral to
gross margin in Q4?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
As always, there are a lot of different factors influencing the gross margin. We're just referring to the external factors, the market value, so to speak.
And we look at primarily the currency, the U.S. dollar is gradually helping us going forward. And that's why for Q4, the best assessment is that if
you take all these together, we assess that it will be pretty neutral for our purchases for the fourth quarter.

Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
Okay. Perfect. And the second follow-up question is on the average store size of the closures. Should we expect an increase in the average store
size of the group stores on average, post closures? Or are you actually closing also large stores?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
I think going back to I think what Adam said before, it's not the size, as such, we look at each store always in a holistic view when we do the store
optimization, looking at online, looking at brands, looking at stores. And then the decision might differ a lot from store to store. So it's not about
size, it's more about how the store fits in the total picture.

Operator
Okay. Our next question is from the line of Niklas Ekman from Carnegie.

Niklas Ekman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Consumer Discretionary & Staples and Financial Analyst
Yes. Firstly, I'd like to ask about the current trading, minus 5% in September. That's a fairly solid number given the store closures you still have. And
my impression of this is that the market is still down by around 10% or maybe more. So this suggests outperformance by you. And I'm just curious
if you agree with this. If you can elaborate a bit on what you see the drivers here? Do you see much stronger new collections? Is online sales a major
driver? That's my first question.

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Right. So we do see that the collections are very well received and that the team -- teams have done a fantastic job when it comes to listen to the
customers and creating the new assortment.

Then we also see the benefit of thinking omni. With omni then, I mean integrating the channels and trying to meet the customers where they
choose to meet us. That means, of course, growing online. It means optimizing the store network and it means to continue the agenda on that
integration.

Niklas Ekman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Consumer Discretionary & Staples and Financial Analyst
Okay. And second question is going back on the cost structure. I'm just curious, if you compare the cost outlook for 2021 compared to 2019, so
kind of stripping out the COVID-19 impact, do you see a potential for tangibly lower costs in 2021? And not just for -- related to store closures, but
kind of on a comparable basis. Are you in a better position in terms of costs? Is there a lot of negotiation power here in terms of rental agreements,
et cetera?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Our agreements with the landlords give us a lot of flexibility to continue that dialogue. So we continuously have dialogues with our partners. And
that is partly why we have managed the cost reductions for third quarter, and that will continue going forward as well.

But as Helena mentioned, the third quarter is a consequence of decisive early actions that also affected third quarter. It's a combination of really
sort of short term here now, crisis mitigation actions. But also we're learning a lot of things. We're pushing boundaries in partly how we work and
testing new ways of working.

So it's a big combination of questions, but I think a huge asset is the flexibility we have in our cost structures related to rent, and that's something
we will continue to work with.

The next question is from the line of Adam Cochrane from Citi.

Adam Gareth Cochrane - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director
Two questions, if I may. The first question is, can you give us a slight description around the profitability by channel? With the growth in online
sales that you've seen, can you explain how that impacts the level of online profitability on a stand-alone basis?

And then clearly, the total level that you think about the omnichannel -- I suppose I really want to get a feeling of how, with higher volumes, has
that improved your level of online profitability?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Okay, Adam. As we've discussed many times, this is a combination of having the -- both the online and the physical stores, and it's difficult to take
one from the other -- against the other, so to speak. So I think again to Helena's point here, that the secret here is that we have the integrated --
and are developing integration even more. So the omni is really what the customers want, and we see that the channels actually help and strengthen
and complement each other.

But if you try to break it out, of course, when stores are closed, profitability in the store channel was very low in Q2 and Q3, whereas in online, it
was pretty good, given this high volumes and where the customers could continue to shop and increase their shopping in online channel.

Adam Gareth Cochrane - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director
Is there a scenario where, if the online penetration remains high, that your online profitability would remain high? And some of the actions you've
taken on the store cost base, are any of those, whether it's moving to variable leases or whether it's changing working practices, that your store
profitability can cope with a lower level of absolute sales going forward, but your online profitability remains higher than it was?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Of course.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Adam Gareth Cochrane - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. Got it. In terms of that permanent reduction in store cost base from working practices, are you able to give any idea of things that you've
done which maybe reduces the number of hours needed in the stores? Then they're doing online orders from store. What are we doing with the
store cost base in terms of describing that?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
As mentioned, partly is sort of adjusting here and now. It's everything from number of deliveries to stores, that reduces handling cost. We're looking
into how to work with tagging stores, stores tagging, alarms and so forth, to sort of take away some administrative work in the stores and so forth.

It's a wide range here, but we're trying many things and testing many things. And this situation during the spring and the summer has really put
some force behind those tests. And we're learning as we go here. But those are sort of examples of practical aspects of what we've been doing.

Adam Gareth Cochrane - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director
Okay. And final question was really around that very impressive 90 million members of your H&M Club. How -- with the data that you have on those
customers, when you've put them in markets where, obviously, the stores were shut, they may have shopped online, how are those members
where you've got data on, how are they trending once the stores are reopened? Are they still increasing their online shop? Are they going back to
store? Can you just give us an idea of, with the data that you've got, how the customers are behaving in markets as conditions are changing, please?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
I guess what is becoming even more clear to us is that customers, they don't want to meet us in one channel. They sometimes want to meet us
online. They sometimes want to go to a store. They could order something online that they want to pick up in store or they might -- they might
want to find something online that they can then go to a store and find their size.

So just to give a few examples, it becomes clearer and clearer when looking at the data that we can, through our loyalty program, interact and
engage with customers in new and very interesting ways. And it becomes even clearer that customers want to meet us in both channels.

Adam Gareth Cochrane - Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director
Has their behavior changed at all throughout this period? Obviously, you've got some of the -- 50 million of these customers, you've had from
before COVID. You've gone through COVID. Have you noticed any structural change in their behavior? Or is it that they're just continuing the trends
of shopping more online or multichannel that you saw before? They haven't changed throughout the period of COVID and then stores reopening?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Yes. What we see overall in our customer base is that more customers have entered the online channel for the first time. So we do see that more
customers have kind of been introduced to the channel in a different way and faster than we have seen before.

The next question is from the line of Aneesha Sherman from Bernstein.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Aneesha Sherman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst
I have 2 questions, please. First one is again on the 250 store closures next year. Can you talk about the corresponding changes in the store support
organization that you're making or planning to make? Are you making any major changes to that organization in conjunction with the closing of
stores?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Practically, we are looking into how to best support the stores, obviously, that we run. And with the consolidation, the store portfolio and the
footprint will look slightly different. And of course, we need to find new ways of working to support those stores in the best possible way. So we
look at this from a totality point of view. But no sort of here and now assessment of how that may affect.

Aneesha Sherman - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. And then my -- sorry, go ahead. My second question is, you've spoken for a few years about the AI that you were building and the various
improvements that we'll have across the business. Can you shed some light on the progress of that project, especially now under leadership of
your new CTO, please?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Well, AI is definitely one great tool for us to stay really customer-focused and also that is helping us to become more fast and flexible. So for example,
in our supply chain, that is a great tool for us to also forecast demand. And I would say, to some extent, we use AI in different parts of our value
chain to both kind of improve the hit rate when it comes to collections and what customer wants and for us to become faster.

Operator
Next question is from the line of Rebecca McClellan from Santander.

Rebecca Anne McClellan - Grupo Santander, Research Division - Equity Analyst
I have a couple of questions, please. Firstly, the 350 shops that you're expecting to close in 2021, what percentage of sales does that represent?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
We are -- yes, it's difficult to say now with the stores being closed now during this year. But it's obviously, as Nils said a little bit said here as well,
we're not closing the most profitable stores and we're not closing the biggest stores from a turnover perspective. So we assessed that there would
be a lesser impact on turnover and profit from a number perspective.

Rebecca Anne McClellan - Grupo Santander, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Okay. And secondly, just you're talking about sort of the importance of integration, et cetera. Your online returns in-store is available in 16 markets;
Click and Collect, 14, which compares to 15 and 12 this time last year. So is there not sort of like a sort of an increased motivation to get that more
broadly sort of spread out across the market?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Yes, all of these initiatives that is about integrating the channel is an agenda that we really actively want to work with going forward. Of course,
some initiatives during the crisis, we had to slow down for a while. But going forward, this is of utmost important to continue.

Rebecca Anne McClellan - Grupo Santander, Research Division - Equity Analyst
And what sort of stops the sort of automatic rollout of online in-store, for example?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Well, it's very much related to the platform transformation we're doing and that we're taking step by step and rolling out. So customers can sort
of enjoy the full omni package that we are having in some markets. So that is a little bit the connection so -- to the technical backbone.

Operator
Next question is from the line of Richard Chamberlain from RBC.

Richard B. Chamberlain - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Consumer Retail
I just had a couple of questions, please. I -- first of all, could you comment on how much the temporary rent reliefs were in the third quarter? And
what we should expect for Q4 in terms of rent relief and government support?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
The absolute majority of the rent reductions are based on our flexible agreements with the landlord. So it's the absolute majority is the turnover-based
rents that has contributed to cost savings here. But of course, we have had also dialogues with some landlords during second quarter that has
affected the start of third quarter. But the absolute majority is the flexible rent setup.

Richard B. Chamberlain - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Consumer Retail
Okay. So the amount of sort of rental holidays, if you like then, that's pretty small, is it, for H&M in the quarter?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Yes. And as a totality, it also is now trickling down. So it's a lot less impacted by that in third quarter. But for some markets, we do have -- for U.K.,
for example, we have the business rates relief, and that will continue throughout the fourth quarter. So there are variations from market to market,
but the majority is the flexible rent setup we do have.

Richard B. Chamberlain - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Consumer Retail
Yes. And presumably, the majority of the government support furlough -- the government support will fall away in the fourth quarter?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Yes, exactly.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Richard B. Chamberlain - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Consumer Retail
Okay. Okay. Okay. I just have another question, please, just in terms -- on the subject of speed to market, which you've commented on already.

But I wondered, are you seeing much faster times of sourcing product coming from Asia. And is that being driven by strong online demand? So
you are seeing a material reduction in the number of weeks that it's taking supply to get from Asia to your markets?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Well, for the industry, as a whole, the speed of flexibility will just become more and more important. So what we clearly see is changes in processes
to kind of tighten some of the time lines in, for example, decision-making, that is also kind of enabling shorter overall lead times than from ID to
customer, if that makes sense.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Simon Irwin from Crédit Suisse.

Simon William George Irwin - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
I'll try and make it quick. Can you just talk a little bit about the timing of when you pay turnover-based rents. Are they accounted for in the quarter
relating to the sales? Or is there any kind of lagging element to those payments?

And can you just talk also a little bit more about some of the programs that are going through. Obviously, there are kind of quite a few big programs
over the last few years, which have been kind of rolling off, I'm thinking particularly some of the IT and accounting and things.

Is that helping the OpEx? Or are they now being replaced by other ones, bearing in mind the -- Helena's comments around the speeding up digital?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
First question regarding the turnover rents. Previously, we have paid them in advance. But now due to the situation, we have adjusted that because
of the uncertainty with the turnover. So there is a slight lagging effect there to the first question.

Secondly, we see that we are able now to work smart in many parts of the business. It's hard to quantify the impact of it. But of course, simple
examples, that's how now we use digital ways of meeting and not traveling and so forth. So it's impacting us in many areas. Difficult to quantify
the total impact, so to say.

Operator
Okay. Next question is from the line of Anne Critchlow from Societe Generale.

Anne Critchlow - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research - Equity Analyst
My question -- my first question is about the different concepts. Are there any big differences in how they've performed through the pandemic?
Did you have any surprises there?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Not sure if you mean the different brands we have in our portfolio or different concepts. But overall, we would say that during the crisis, as we
spoke about in quarter 2, we have seen an increased demand on more basic need products overall and that we can more or less see in all brands.

Anne Critchlow - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research - Equity Analyst
Okay. And then my second question is about the store closures. Do you see this as a one-off program for 2021? Or should we pencil in a similar
number of store closures in the outer years?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
So this is kind of a living agenda. We continuously develop our store network. Obviously, we believe a lot in also physical stores going forward, and
we see that, that is what the customers tell us. They want to meet us in physical stores and online. So continuously, we work with this development
agenda. And difficult to then give numbers after 2021 and onwards. So we'll get back to that later on. But again, back to the importance of integrating
the channels, which would be key.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
And also flexibility so that we can adjust accordingly as we go.

Operator
Okay. Next question is from the line again of Daniel Schmidt.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes, just a follow-up from me. You have an extraordinary sort of impairment charge of close to SEK 500 million. Could you shed some more light
on what that exactly refers to when it comes to development projects?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
We have, as we did during the spring and the summer, I reviewed sort of everything top to toe in the company, and then we have also put some
extra light on both the ongoing development project, but also previous development project. And this is a consequence of that review, and it's
also connected to what I spoke about before, the transition into new platforms and so forth. When we assess it, and we're getting into the more
modern data and tech infrastructure, we then saw the opportunity to do this impairment test and the provision through third quarter.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
But has it really been accentuated by COVID-19? Is that sort of a right way to put it? Or has COVID-19 anything to do with it?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
It's more that we've put extra light on everything we do. So it's more in that part of the process that we really reviewed everything we do and work
with. So it's more connected to the full assessment of everything we have done and are currently doing to ensure we mitigate the effects of the
COVID-19.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
And the sort of the data breach fine that you took, EUR 35 million, that's done and dusted. Is there any sort of more consequences coming from
that in the coming quarters?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
So when it comes to that, we just got it. So we have a provision for it, and we are now reviewing that decision.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
Could it be sort of less? Or it could be reversed? Or is that what you're referring to? Or are you in any way sort of reviewing how you're going to go
forward? Because you took the provision in Q3, right?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
Yes. We took the provision in Q3. Difficult to comment on the question, lower or higher. But we have gotten their decision, and this is now under
our review.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. Okay. And then just a final question on return rates. Many of your peers are saying that they're seeing sort of significantly lower return rates
online since COVID-19 sort of broke out. Have you seen a similar pattern?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
We do see that, and it's also connected to the previous question regarding what we have sold. So we believe it's a lot related to what products and
the basket mix and connected to more basics and what Helena said, the need product, then lower return rates may follow as a consequence of
that. But of course, that will shift over time when demand sort of normalizes. So -- but we see a here and now reduction in returns.

Daniel Schmidt - Danske Bank A/S, Research Division - Research Analyst
Have you seen it shifting already, if you look at the past sort of couple of months more to a normalized return rate?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
As Helena said, the quarter 3 is still -- we see the high -- the relatively higher demand in the need product category. So as long as that sort of sustains,
there will be a slight sort of shift of mix when it comes to returns which is, from a return rate point of view, favorable. Yes.

 Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
Sorry, just a very quick one on the impairment charge. I was just wondering, is this all allocated in OpEx, the SEK 486 million? Or is it partly in the
gross margin? And if so, can you please give us the split between the 2, the reallocation of the charge, please?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Yes, the SEK 486 million is under selling and -- SG&A.

Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
Okay. So nothing in the COGS?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Yes, there are some in the COGS as well. That's always -- as Adam said, we do impairment test continuously. So yes, there are always something in
the COGS as well. But that's not as material.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Andreas Lundberg from SEB.

Andreas Lundberg - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Could you give us some update on your supply chain? I know you opened a few new warehouses, some pure online, some store and online-related,
Milton Keynes, Germany, Madrid and so forth. What's the status there? How are they performing? And are you still running as a double facilities in
some places?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
We are continuing the agenda when it comes to integrating the channels, as we have discussed a lot today. That also means that we are continuing
to develop our supply chain accordingly, and distribution centers is one part of that.

One example where we have kind of merged channels so that the different channel store and online that we can kind of merge the availability is
Milton Keynes. The -- so far what we have seen is good results on that which kind of makes us very confident that our agenda, when it comes to
availability and again, merging the channels, is definitely the way to go forward.

Andreas Lundberg - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
But are you still having some of the old warehouses that you eventually plan to close open? Or have they been closed?

Helena Helmersson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CEO
We -- I mean the journey of integrating channels and doing that also when it comes to distribution centers, is constantly under development. So
we will definitely take more measures to kind of merge the different channels going forward, which is the agenda is about the physical distribution
centers. But maybe even more importantly, also about the technical platform that will make this happen.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Operator
Okay. The next question is from the line of Charlie Muir-Sands from Exane.

Charlie Muir-Sands - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
My first question, sorry, just going back to Simon Irwin's question earlier, I just wanted to clarify. You said previously, you used to pay your rents in
advance. Now there is a lag. I just wanted to check, from a P&L perspective, though, are you accruing as you go? Or is there a lag now in that?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
No, there's no lag from -- the costs are taken when they occur, so to say. So it's only a cash flow perspective.

Charlie Muir-Sands - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
Great. Second question relates to specifically United States. It was one of your weaker top 10 markets in Q3. You also called it out as a market that
might be a focus for store closures in the year ahead, even though you have, let's say, substantially fewer stores in the U.S. than you do in -- across
Europe.

Is there something in particular that's happening in the U.S. which is making you more aggressive in the transformation of your footprint there?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
We've seen that coming into the quarter, we globally had 20% or so stores closed. And now when we exit the quarter, we have 3% closed. But the
U.S. is still the market where we have the highest share of stores, both closed and also affected from limited trading hours and so forth. So that is
reflected in the results for the quarter.

We can also see that different parts of the U.S., and we are very present in -- on the coast, and that has also affected selling in the U.S. proportionally
more than in other markets where we are more sort of densely populated throughout the market.

So other than that, there's no sort of big shift, but rather a temporary lag that when it comes to the effects of COVID affecting us more in the U.S.
than in other markets.

Charlie Muir-Sands - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
Very clear. And my final question is, it would be very helpful to give us an early glimpse on your thoughts for 2021 with respect to store openings
and closures. I just wondered, with respect to CapEx, which this year, you cut your original budget quite significantly down to, I think, SEK 5 billion
was the last figure you gave for Q2. Do you think that you'll need to play a little bit of catch-up when you go into 2021? Or is something close to
SEK 5 billion a run rate which the business can sustain?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
No. We believe that this is a suppressed level that we -- now with a little bit more visibility, we'll start to assess. And we believe that as we get sort
of more solid ground under our feet, we will start to see where we can start investing again towards more normalized levels.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Charlie Muir-Sands - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division - Research Analyst
And would more normalized level be in line with depreciation? Or do you think a little bit below that?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
But we haven't fully set, but we are believing that 2019 is probably a good sort of benchmark to relate to 2019 levels rather than 2020.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) So our next question is from the line of Rebecca McClellan.

Rebecca Anne McClellan - Grupo Santander, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Yes. Just a follow-up from me, please. Can you talk about the composition of your inventory? How much of sort of spring/summer you're still
carrying forward? And also for autumn/winter, is -- are you budgeting towards sort of minus 5% constant currency? Or what sort of levels -- is there
some sort of stress in terms of having inventory, if your budgets were more conservative than that?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
To start with the inventory composition, we spoke about it after the second quarter that this is one of the key questions for us to sort out, how do
we keep a relevant assortment and offering to the customers when we have pulled back on buying. And as Helena mentioned, the teams have
done a tremendous work, reworking the offering to really match the demand from the customers. So sort of the technical worry we had before
the summer is not as big anymore, even though we naturally, with so many stores closed, have a slightly inflated level of spring garments. But as
we can see now, we are able to shift those out without having to take too much discount. So we are pleased with the composition as it sits right
now.

And I forgot your second question. Sorry.

Rebecca Anne McClellan - Grupo Santander, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Oh I was just -- I was talking about for autumn/winter, I was asking whether the sort of the minus 5% constant currency was the level around which
you were actually budgeting for or?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
No. We -- I think also Nils mentioned it, that now when the number of affected stores is constantly fluctuating, we believe that we are having a
conservative approach to the autumn here. And believing that if stores can continue to open and customers can come, we can do better. But we
are also respectful for the situation that it fluctuates. And right now, actually, we have more stores closed than we did a week ago. So we don't --
we didn't dare to make any sharp prognosis for fourth quarter.

Next question is from the line of Chiara Battistini.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Chiara Battistini - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Co-Lead, European General Retail
Sorry, last one for me. On the -- maybe, on the current trading, on the minus 5% for September, I was wondering, would you be able to give us a
bit more color on where you're actually seeing such an improvement regionally. And also is it coming through both online and off-line? Or is it
really off-line starting to recover as the stores have been reopening and consumers are feeling a bit more comfortable coming back to the stores?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Chiara, as you can see on the update, market by market, the big difference is from market to market due to differences in different markets and
how the COVID is affecting. And that is, of course, still the case. And I'd just like to remind everyone that we're still not out of the crisis. We're still
in it, even though we hope that most of it is behind us. So there are big differences also now in these numbers from market to market, even within
Europe, there are big differences.

And between online and stores, obviously, the -- as we've spoken about many times now, and Helena said as well the online continues to do very
well, of course. But the importance of the omnichannel is really the thing here that we see that when customers can shop in both channels, they
are happy.

Operator
Next question is from the line of Magnus Råman from Kepler.

Magnus Råman - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst
Yes. I just want to come back to the online returns question here. You mentioned the higher share of basic items pushing down the return rates.
Could it also relate to a demography change? You mentioned that new customer groups, perhaps older customers, have also been introduced to
the online channel, driven by COVID-19, and they might potentially be low returners. So do you see such effect as well that might be more sticky?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
It's probably also included in the shift we do. So there are a lot of elements affecting. But the big driver of this is the sort of need product versus
the want product, and that we see the increased demand throughout this period on sort of need products, both the basics, as Helena mentioned,
but also kids wear and so forth, that are less prone to be returned.

Magnus Råman - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst
Right. And then just a follow-up also on markdowns. Your markdown increase in Q3 was much smaller than you initially anticipated at the beginning
of the quarter. And now you expect an increase in Q4, 1 to 1.5 percentage points. Is it -- I mean given that the price environment or the ability to
do full price sales in Q3 turned out more favorable than you expected, have you sort of included that better market environment in your projections
for markdown increase in Q4 or not?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Yes. We do have, but it's just to give our fairest and best assessment of how we will act now during the quarter. And as I mentioned before, fourth
quarter as well as second quarter are less of markdown quarter. So that's why the proportionate effect gets bigger here, but it's from a lower
absolute level. So it's to give some kind of indication of how we believe the need of activation will look. So it's not a dramatic increase in absolute
number, but just the relative goes up quite a bit for fourth quarter, as we, last year, went down a lot. So...
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Magnus Råman - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst
Well, the reason I asked also is that, even if it's a smaller markdown quarter in general, if you make a stack comparison like with multiyear stack
markdown increase and decrease in Q4s, you still arrive at a quite soft comparison also on a flat comparison to Q4s, so to speak, just as is the case
with Q3s.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Yes, but you're right. But as Adam said, we need to be cautious here. We're still not out of the crisis, just to remind everyone about that. So I think
it's better to have a cautious view.

And yes, we still have, as Helena said, spring garments that we -- and the level is still higher than we want to get to in the longer term.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Peter Testa from One Investments.

Peter Testa - One Investments S.A.G.L. - Analyst
Two questions, please. Maybe just continuing from that point on the gross margin. Is -- do you have visibility over that because largely, you've
carried out the remaining spring/summer inventory move in September as you prepared the fall/winter?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Say again. Repeat the question, please.

Peter Testa - One Investments S.A.G.L. - Analyst
Do you have stronger visibility over that markdown because you may have carried out the remaining -- moving of the spring/summer inventory
you mentioned before in September, as you prepared the collection for the fall/winter?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
We're constantly reviewing sort of the commercial plan and how that will look throughout the autumn there, and that's reflected then in our
assessment on the markdown levels. So it's both what we see and what we believe going forward, connected to the commercial agenda.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
We definitely have a better visibility now compared to where we stood 3 months ago when we were in -- really in the middle of the crisis.

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
On that note, yes, of course.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Peter Testa - One Investments S.A.G.L. - Analyst
Yes, yes, yes. Okay. And the other question is just on expenses. I mean you have obviously the 400 of furlough going, as you said. And the turnover
rents will move with sales. Is there anything else about expenses in Q3 that will, say, short-term measures that may unwind -- sorry, Q2 may unwind
now and -- excuse me, Q3 unwind now in Q4?

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
No. And we also know now that when stores are opening, of course, and we want to offer the customer the full sort of experience, we will remove
some of the extreme measures, as Helena mentioned, and we closed fitting rooms and so forth. There are some components of this that we believe
will be sort of phased out as we move into a little bit more normalized setup of the stores and operations.

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
But also, as Helena said, we now start to accelerate things. And of course we need people and resources to make that happen. So that's what we
gradually now are accelerating the business again.

Adam Karlsson - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - CFO
Yes. That's right.

Peter Testa - One Investments S.A.G.L. - Analyst
And as you enter a normal environment, things like marketing initiatives and people and so on, will they start to become more representative of
what you would have seen in the prior years -- this time of the year?

Nils Vinge - H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB (publ) - Head of IR/Franchise
Yes.

Operator
No more further questions. Please continue.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Thank you for standing by. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the NovaGold Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator
Instructions) And the conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)

I would now like to turn the conference over to Melanie Hennessey, Vice President, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.

Melanie Hennessey - NovaGold Resources Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications
Thank you, Claudia. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased that you have joined us for NovaGold's third quarter financial results and also for an
update on the Donlin Gold project.

On today's call, we have Dr. Thomas Kaplan, NovaGold's Chairman; Greg Lang, NovaGold's President and CEO; and David Ottewell, NovaGold's Vice
President and CFO. At the end of the webcast, we will take questions both by phone and by text.

I would like to remind our webcast and call participants that, as stated on Slide 3, any statements made today may contain forward-looking
information, such as projections and goals, which are likely to involve risks detailed in our various EDGAR and SEDAR filings and forward-looking
disclaimers included in this presentation.

With that, I have the pleasure of introducing Greg Lang. Greg?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
Good morning, and thank you, Melanie. The Donlin Gold project is in the Western part of the great state of Alaska, as shown on Slide 4, and it's a
50-50 joint venture with Barrick Gold. Mining is an important part of the Alaskan economy and becoming even more important to the state as
revenues and the unemployment and the other businesses decline.

As shown on the map, there are 6 producing mines and numerous exploration and development projects in the state. In terms of scale, quality
and exploration potential, Donlin Gold's attributes far exceed any other gold development project on the horizon. When combined with the
company's excellent partnership with the Native Corporations and co-owner Barrick, the exceptional leverage to a rising gold price, a strong cash
position and key federal permits in hand, NovaGold is in a league of its own.

Slide 5 highlights the strategic focus for the year. As COVID-19 positive cases rose in Alaska over the summer, Donlin Gold's stringent safety measures
and on-the-ground support allowed us to operate 4 rigs throughout the quarter, making up for the time we lost with the pandemic-related shutdown
earlier in the year. In August, NovaGold and our partner, Barrick, reported the initial set of assays from the planned 80-hole, 22,000-meter program,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 the largest program in over 12 years. The work was carried out safely and finished ahead of schedule despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which
impacted activities on the ground and affected the communities in which we operate.

Other resource industries have been experiencing low or no growth in Alaska, and the impact of COVID-19 on the cruise ship and other tourism
industries may take years to recover. With the long history of mining and a skilled workforce in Alaska, Donlin Gold offers the opportunity of a
future with good paying year-round jobs and training for young people to live closer to home and continue a traditional way of life. We are proud
that greater than 80% of our local workforce were native Alaskans.

On Slide 6, we outlined the protocol for the health and safety during the COVID pandemic. NovaGold continued to abide by a comprehensive set
of policies designed to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees and contractors at its offices in Salt Lake City and Vancouver as well in
conjunction with Barrick at the Donlin Gold office in Anchorage. I expect these precautions will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a significant concern in the Y-K region due to the interdependence of communities and frequent travel within
the region. By the time that COVID reached Alaska, our Native Corporation partners had already engaged with the community to assist the needs
of the area.

As shown on Slide 7, Donlin Gold partnered with TKC and tribal councils to coordinate food collection and delivery of supplies to 8 middle Kuskokwim
villages. We took the precaution to pause the 2020 program.

When we did this, Donlin Gold donated thousands of pounds of food at the camp and coordinated with local tribal administrators to deliver these
various goods, such as food and masks to the communities. Donlin Gold also provides support to the CleanUp GreenUp initiative, a program that
we have funded for many years.

The 2020 drill program is shown on Slide 8 with the ACMA and Lewis deposits. Preparations for the drill program started in February with mobilization
of the rigs to the site in March, all before temporarily pausing activities as a precautionary measure due to COVID. The drill program remobilized
in late May, and we had good productivity and kept all 4 rigs running throughout the summer. The original plan was for 80 holes, the largest at
Donlin in many, many years.

The image on Slide 9 shows the 2020 program core hole location highlighted in black, with the initial assay results that were published in a joint
release with Barrick on August 6 highlighted in yellow. The intercepts reported are encouraging and similar to the drill results reported from the
2017 16-hole drill program, which also encountered higher-than-anticipated grades. The Donlin team completed the drilling in September with a
total of 85 core holes and about 23,000 meters, exceeding our plans. Since we had the time and the crews going, additional holes were completed.
As a result of COVID-19, the assay labs were understaffed and the drill results are coming in slower than expected. Staffing level seems to be
returning to normal and the new assay results are starting to come in again. Additional results will be reported by Donlin and the joint owners
when they become available.

The initial results that were issued by Donlin Gold in the third quarter reflect the enthusiasm we have every time we drill on the property. As shown
on Slide 10, these significant high-grade intervals were intercepted in multiple areas, with several of them occurring near surface.

As more results are received, our understanding of ore body and the potential extensions of the high-grade zones will improve. Once core logging
and assay is complete, the newly obtained data should lead the partners to determine the next step to move forward with updating the Donlin
Gold feasibility study. It was truly a remarkable operational milestone that we were able to complete this work ahead of schedule and without any
COVID cases at the Donlin mine site.

Donlin Gold is working with its Native Corporation partners and continues to support the state of Alaska to advance other permits and certificates
needed for the project. As you can see on Slide 11, federal permits are in hand and additional key state permits and approvals have also been
updated. In early 2020, the Department of Natural Resources issued final authorization of the easements, land leases, land use permits and material
site authorizations for the proposed transportation facilities.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 There are other state permits that remain outstanding and they're not on the critical path, and we will continue to advance them.

The partnership of NovaGold, Barrick and Calista has responded well to the COVID-19 and its impacts on the health of our communities. These
long-standing relationships have been strengthened over the last year as we remain united in the common goal of bringing the Donlin Gold project
up the value chain. We focused our culture of safety and social responsibility to corporate and great governance practices. By engaging our
stakeholders through regular contact, interacting with our investors and engaging in meaningful ways to promote the health and safety of our
people on site and on the river through all the seasons. Especially now, Donlin brought much needed support to the local communities. We continue
to provide youth assistance in their education and partner to improve the environment, always recognizing the importance of preserving traditional
lifestyles.

In the third quarter, Donlin delivered on the supportive community partnerships in the Y-K region, as shown on Slide 13. Health and safety are core
values for us. As such, Donlin is working with TKC, the state of Alaska and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium in our initiative to upgrade
as well as improve health and safety standards of water and sewer services in the Kuskokwim area communities. Our other initiatives include Donlin
Gold scholarships, which are granted to students selected by our Native Corporation partners to benefit youth education in the region. As well,
the CleanUp GreenUp initiative continued and included 32 villages who came together to clean up their local environment. Over the past few
years, backhaul efforts to remove household hazardous waste have been delivered to health of communities along the river.

As shown on Slide 14, the project established the Donlin Gold backhaul program in association with other native partners. It was a very successful
program and a total of 45,000 pounds of household hazardous material were collected and shipped out for proper disposal.

Slide 15 presents the life-of-mine diagram for the Donlin Gold project as one of the largest open pit mining development undertakings. The time
invested upfront to build a solid foundation from which to grow and sustain has been critical to the project's success. Permitting is a long undertaking
and not the most interesting segment in the life of the mine. It requires tremendous effort and focus, but it does lay a strong foundation. A typical
gold mine project now exceeds 15 years from discovery to development. Project catalysts for the coming months are complete the drill program,
release assay results and incorporate all of this data into the latest geologic model, and this will help determine the next steps the partners will
choose to make to advance the Donlin Gold project.

The next few slides highlights the attributes of Donlin that led me to join NovaGold after a great, almost 30-year career with Barrick and its predecessor
companies. We saw earlier in the presentation that global grade continues to decline and that mine production is expected to continue this decrease
by 2022. Most major producers have focused on in situ extensions in mine life. This sets up the supply crunch scenario that the gold industry has
never experienced historically. The sharp underinvestment in exploration and discovery, particularly since 2012, has led us to where we are today.
Over the past 10 years, only 25 new deposits have been identified containing only 150 million ounces of gold, which represents only 7% of what
has been discovered over 30 years. And there have been no major discoveries in the last few years. Projects like Donlin are becoming increasingly
valuable.

Now to expand further on Donlin's attributes. It's the largest gold development project in its category. The bar chart on Slide 18 shows 13 other
development stage projects and illustrates how truly unique Donlin is when compared to its peer group. Based on the group average of 7.7 million
ounces, Donlin's resource is 5x greater on average. Grade is also, by far, a category that stands out as a characteristic of Donlin. Grade is king. And
as shown on Slide 19, it's more than twice the global average for large-scale open pit deposits. Not only is the global gold production decreasing
for most of the major producers, but average grades continue to decline. Grade alone is a positive differentiator for the project's economic viability
as it provides extraordinary resilience through multiple commodity cycles and is a key attribute to ensure the successful development of any great
mining operation, especially one blessed with longevity like Donlin Gold.

Producing more than 1 million ounces annually, there are only 3 operating mines in the world today at these levels. Donlin would be in rare
company. As currently envisioned, the project will average during -- average 1.1 million ounces over its life. For the long-term investor, there's
additional value that comes with a multi-decade lifespan from its start, and it's a jurisdiction where the rule of law is well established.

Calista and TKC have been our partners since 1995, and we have life-of-mine agreements with both of them. They have been deeply supportive
and involved from the start, and we are thankful for their long-term support and commitment. We support their mandate through the Alaska Native

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Claims Settlement Act, as highlighted on Slide 21, to help them develop their land for their economic self-determination. With all of the complexities
in many jurisdictions around the world, it's great to be on private land with native partners.

I'll now turn the call over to David Ottewell, our Chief Financial Officer. Dave?

David A. Ottewell - NovaGold Resources Inc. - VP & CFO
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Slide 22 highlights our operating performance. For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $12.7
million, $4.6 million higher than the prior year quarter. The net loss increased primarily due to the drilling program at Donlin Gold, with higher
corporate, general and administrative expenses and foreign exchange movements also contributing to the increase. A reduction in interest rates
also resulted in lower interest income on term deposits and in lower interest expense on the promissory note payable to Barrick.

Third quarter 2020 cash flows are highlighted on Slide 23. In the third quarter, we spent $8 million, $3.9 million higher than the prior year quarter.
Again, the net increase in spending was primarily due to the drilling program at Donlin Gold, along with lower interest income and higher general
and administrative costs. We ended the quarter with cash and term deposits of $126.3 million.

On Slide 24, we note our robust treasury. In addition to our cash and term deposits of $126 million, we have $75 million due next summer and an
additional $25 million 2 years later as a result of our sale of our share of the Galore Creek project to Newmont. A further contingency payment of
$75 million becomes due if the owners approve construction of the Galore Creek project.

We continue to anticipate spending approximately $31 million in 2020, which includes $20 million to fund our share of expenditures at the Donlin
Gold project for the drilling program, permitting and community engagement; and $11 million for corporate, general and administrative costs.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Kaplan, who will give us his insight into gold. Tom?

Thomas Scott Kaplan - NovaGold Resources Inc. - Chairman of the Board
Thank you, Dave. Actually, I'm going to spend a little bit of time today on explaining why as someone who, 99% of the time, is on the side of the
table of the investors on this conference call, why it is that I believe that NovaGold will become one of the very few go-to stocks in this space and
has the potential to multiply many times in value from here.

I know whereof I speak. I have had multiple occasions where I've been able to be lucky enough to make 100x my money. The common denominator
in all those cases was being able to ride great assets, take them up the value chain. Some of those assets were absolute category killers, some of
the best in the world, but none of them could I describe as being truly unique. Now what does it mean for me to say that I believe that Donlin is
unique? I often ask the question of investors and analysts the following, what other gold development stage assets in the gold industry today
compares in its combination of enormous size? You've heard Greg describe it. I don't think there's ever been a gold deposit that began production
with 40-plus million ounces. High-grade for an open pit gold mine. When I first got into Donlin in 2008, 2009, the industry grade was almost double
where it is today. So for a large scale, open pit operation, Donlin's grade of plus 2 to 3 grams of gold is absolutely extraordinary.

And what that means is that ceteris paribus, if you've got 1 mine producing at a gram of gold, another mine producing 2 grams of gold, all other
things being equal, the cash cost per ounce is going to be half for the higher grade mine. That's just simple arithmetic. The exploration potential
on Donlin is absolutely extraordinary. I think that there are very few gold deposits in the world where ounces can be added to resources immediately
adjacent to the pit, which holds reserves so cheaply and so readily. But we'll get to that in a few minutes because I do want to spend some time
talking about why we believe that Donlin has the potential to be perhaps the second most famous gold producing area in the United States today
after Nevada.

The production profile, as you've also seen, means that Donlin will be in either 1 or 2 phases, depending on how the optimizations end up working
and gold prices and all those other things, potentially the largest pure gold producing mine in the world. For those of us who like to be able to

                                                                                                                                                                             
 focus on what we call the monetary metals, gold and silver, as opposed to base metals, this is a huge distinction. It would already be one of the
largest gold mines in the world even if copper were added, such as at Grasberg, but this would be pure goal.

The mine life will be measured in decades. That means that it is not just a tier 1 asset, but it is a company-making asset. Historically, great companies
are birthed out of assets that can lap through multiple cycles. Donlin, even if we never added another ounce, would already be going on for decades.

Jurisdiction. Well, the mantra of you want to be in places or with assets that gives you great leverage in jurisdictions that will allow you to keep the
fruits of that leverage. Anyone who's been a shareholder of NovaGold, anyone who's followed me since 2012, when, basically, I announced that I
was leaving almost the entirety of the developing world in order to focus on jurisdictions where I could sleep well at night, will understand that
for us, Donlin represents the holy grail. It represents the best-in-breed in terms of size, grade, exploration potential, production profile, mine life.
But more than that, it's located in a place that when you go to sleep at night, you know that when you wake up in the morning, what you thought
you owned, you still own. There are no insurgents. You haven't been salami strategized into losing your assets, de facto or through de jure
nationalization of which I think we're going to see much, much more in the precious metals space.

So what we have is we have what we believe to be half of the greatest gold development story in the world, and blessed Barrick shareholders,
they've got the other half. But more than that, it's not just that it's a Tier 1 potential asset, it is in a Tier 1 jurisdiction. So let's continue with why
that's important. Sadly, the mining industry is one in which location, location, location is ultimately the existential factor. We are not in a business
where if you find out that wages are soaring or land prices are soaring, you can go to a lower wage jurisdiction or a place where they give you
subsidies.

What you have is what you've got. And what you've got is a hole in the ground where you live by the generosity of strangers who essentially can
tell you to leave at any time or maybe more subtly, encourage you believe or give up more of the assets. I know whereof I speak. I made my first
fortune in Bolivia, a second fortune in Zimbabwe and South Africa in platinum. I sold the Kibali mine or project to Mark Bristow in Congo. So I'm
very, very familiar with these places. And my holdings used to span everywhere from Peru to Pakistan, from Mauritania to Mongolia.

In 2012, I pulled my team out. We go to only those places where the rule of law is not a novelty item. And that led us primarily to North America
and more recently as well to Australia. But here's the thing, the top 10 gold producing operations in the world, of those top 10, only 3 operations
produced greater than 1 million ounces.

One of those is in North America, in Nevada. But the next one, we believe, is going to be in Alaska, maybe Sukhoi Log in Russia, but I don't think
that many of the people on this call are going to be running to Russia so quickly. The fact is that when you talk about a Tier 1 asset or you talk about
a category killer asset, there's no question that we are in that league and more importantly, we're in the right place to make money and to keep it.

The next slide is one that I'm going to dwell on a little bit longer because I realized 2 quarters ago, I sort of made a passing comment in our conference
call with investors, where I mentioned that Warren Buffett has played a role, unintentionally on his part, I'm sure, in my career. And that when I
took my first company public in 1997, it wasn't a great time for mining companies. But the week that I went public, I got really lucky, not for the
first time. Warren Buffett was revealed to have purchased, I believe, about 130 million ounces of silver. In one stroke, Warren Buffett detoxified
silver in a way that allowed it to be safe for institutional investors to go back into the water. And in so doing, he benefited some of the people who
were out there building silver companies, like myself, like Ross Beaty, Bob Quartermain. It was a boost to us. And ever since then, silver has been
considered to be an investable institutional quality asset.

Well, that got picked up by a reporter for Business Insider, named Theron, a really nice guy. And he called me up, he covers Warren Buffet, and he
said, ""Could you tell me more about the story?"" I said, ""Do you think it's interesting."" And he said, ""Yes."" I told him the story, and he wrote a very
lovely piece in Business Insider, where I basically acknowledged that I owed a lot to Warren Buffet. And I've had the opportunity several years later
to thank Warren personally, not that he had any idea, but I explained to him what had happened and being the charming guy that he is, he said,
""Well, good for you. That's great.""

But when I was interviewed, Theron asked me again, he said, ""What do you think that Warren Buffet -- what do you think the chances are that he'll
go into gold?"" And I said, ""Well, does lightning really strike twice?"" Maybe. But I just have to assume that he won't because he's so invested in the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 idea that gold to quote John Maynard Keynes, ""It's a barbarous relic,"" it makes no sense to him. And I've heard this from Bill Gates when he and I
talked about gold years later. And I said, ""But it would be wonderful if he did."" Well, lo and behold, last quarter, one of the only stocks, I think maybe
the only stock that Warren Buffett bought was Barrick. And this was obviously great kudos to Mark Bristow and in his mission to make Barrick a key
stock for generalists. You couldn't have better validation.

The funny part was, as I spoke to the journalist again, the common denominator in both of those stories was actually me. And between the silver,
when I went public, and Warren Buffet buying it at the same time and Warren Buffett or his lieutenants, most likely, casting a spotlight on Barrick.
This, as I told, the reporter was likely going to make me even more money because of NovaGold than what happens with the silver. The idea being
that the more the people looked at Barrick's portfolio, the more that people examine the assets, the more focus there is on what we believe to be
one of the greatest gold assets in the world, that being, of course, Donlin.

And I firmly believe that as investors and more generalists do look at Barrick, that a number of them will also take a look at NovaGold. And some
of them will say, ""Wow, I wonder what that's all about?"" And they'll look us up. They'll take a look at our shareholder base, and they'll say, ""Wow, I
know John Paulson or Will Danoff or Jacob Rothschild or the Agnellis or BlackRock or First Eagle. I'm going to give them a call and find out what
they think."" And I do believe that they will be told, as far as we're concerned, Donlin is probably the best gold development story in the world today.
There are 2 ways to buy it, a pure-play through NovaGold. And also, if you want to be able to be in multiple jurisdictions with operating mines and
a great CEO, there's also Mark Bristow and Barrick as well.

And my attitude has always been whatever is good for Mark, he's an old friend, a really good friend, whatever is good for Barrick is going to be
good for NovaGold. After all, as NovaGold goes up in the marketplace, Barrick is now in a position to tell all the analysts that follow it, ""Look, we've
got the same thing as NovaGold. They have a little cash. But other than that, it's about Donlin we should be able to get that added to our NAV."" So
if we go up, it's good for Barrick. If on the other hand, people invest in Barrick, with or without investing in NovaGold, it just gives more positive
reinforcement. It's called a virtuous circle.

But one of the things I realized when we speak to investors, it's more and more because there's so much more interest, and we're getting new
investors looking at the story, they ask the question, ""Can you explain the relationship with Barrick from where you can talk about it to where we
are today?"" And when I answered that question a couple of times, I realized, you know what, it's sort of like the Buffett anecdote. There's a lot of
great stuff for our investors, whether they've been with us for a long time and maybe not heard the story or new investors who clearly are coming
into the NovaGold story, how we got from where we are -- or where we were with Barrick to where we are today because this is extremely important.
Everybody always asks, ""What about Barrick?"" And our attitude has always been, Barrick will come around to seeing things as we do. You need a
higher gold price. But if someone wants growth, they've got to look at Donlin.

Now it's true that there's not been any phenomenon as bullish for us as a company as NovaGold than Mark Bristow coming into the Barrick story.
Put aside that he's an old friend of mine, Mark is an unbelievably accomplished and talented operator. He's also a phenomenal geologist and more
importantly, he is a very, very hands-on kind of guy. So for the first time since 2009, when I got into the story, a CEO from Barrick has gone to visit
Donlin, and I think it's fair to say he liked what he saw. And the truth is that we now see Barrick speaking more about Donlin and even describing
it.

I don't want to cherrypick, but you can always go back into the transcript, as a key asset and a nice new gold opportunity.

Well, this is part of last quarter's wonderful sea change in events. We had great drill results, admittedly only 10%. So we'll see what the others have
to bring forward. We had Barrick putting a light on -- or Buffett putting a light on Barrick, and we had Barrick being willing to speak about Donlin
in a way that they haven't in public.

Now this is why I think the next part of the story is interesting because I don't think there's any reason why I can't speak about things that Barrick
used to tell us in private. So at least you'll understand the context of why I believe that the reserves or the resources at Donlin can grow so much
bigger and why I believe that Donlin will be perceived by investors, which will make it a go-to stock, as the new Nevada or the new Carlin. Even
Mark will acknowledge that prior to his coming into the Barrick story, we have turned Donlin into a global brand. That is deliberate. We are building
a global brand in Donlin. We do believe that it has the potential to be on par with Nevada if more work is done on it.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 So let's go back to the beginning. I watched NovaGold go from a $0.50 stock around the turn of the century to $15, $16 when it was the object of
a hostile takeover attempt by Barrick. I did not own a share of stock on the way up, sadly. I watched as the shareholders of NovaGold, which,
obviously, I wasn't one, rejected that takeover offer, and the stock popped into the $20s afterwards. Extraordinary story. Then as a consequence
of some self-inflected wounds and you had superimposed onto that, the financial crisis, the stock did a complete round trip and it went back down
to $0.50, $1. And that's when we came into the story as the Electrum Group, which is my family holding company.

At that time, I was bullish on only gold. We had sold our energy company in 2007, which was the fastest-growing privately held natural gas producer,
in order to pivot into gold and to re-enter silver. When NovaGold made this trip, and I had coveted Donlin from -- for years and years and years, I
decided to buy the company. Fortunately, one of my key lieutenants, who's been with me ever since and hopefully will outlive me, Igor Levental,
that would be the male part of the power couple in mining of Jessica and Igor Levental, our President, said to me, ""I think you should reconsider,
boss. You're not going to get away with it."" And I said, ""Why?"" A couple of hundred million dollars. I have it. It was December of 2007, the world
was not really buying things -- December of 2008, excuse me. And he said, ""Well, look, you may be able to buy it at $2, but Barrick is really, really,
really pissed off that they lost this. There's a lot of resentment about this once they get over the shell shock of what's going on, they'll have plenty
of time to be able to walk you up dollar for dollar. And at some point, you'll fold. In which case, you have nothing. So better to save the company,
which is about to go into bankruptcy and become the largest shareholder of the company and take it from there. Better to own 40% of something
fabulous than 0% because it's okay to be greedy, but not ridiculously greedy."" That was great advice, for which I am forever indebted to Igor for
having that sensibility.

We bought it. And the stock really was something that institutional investors could not have bought. They had no balance sheet. They had no
credibility on The Street. They had environmental issues on an asset called Rock Creek that probably no one has ever heard of by now because we
got rid of it. Shareholder lawsuits, all kinds of stuff. Management was very unloved, needless to say. But we bought it, and we turned all of those
things around and the stock multiplied.

Now around that time, I reached out to Barrick. I had no bad blood with Barrick. To the contrary, any experience I've ever had with Barrick, when
Randall Oliphant was there, was very, very pleasant and professional. And I asked them whether we could have a meeting. And they said, ""Sure.""
They had expectations of what the meeting was about, I had different expectations. Now let me take one step backwards. When we did the deal
with NovaGold, I was afraid that we wouldn't have enough time to get the deal done. And I gave my team 48 hours to do the due diligence on the
company that was like catching a falling knife, to which my team basically said, ""That's not really possible.""

And I said, ""Here's the analogy, which I'd like to give you. There are 2 guys walking in the woods. They encounter a bear. One of them starts to run,
and the other one leans over changes his hiking boots into tennis shoes. And the guy who's running looks back and says, why aren't you running?
And he says, I don't think you understand. I don't have to outrun you -- I don't have to run the bear. I have to outrun you."" I said, ""I don't care what
NovaGold has to say about Donlin."" I just care about Barrick. Barrick doesn't lie. And if Barrick basically is confirming that Donlin is real. I said, ""That's
all that I need to know and I'm willing to take the risk.""

Subsequent to our intervention, I sent my Chief Geologist, Dr. Larry Buchanan, a very, very, very famous and renowned geologists, to visit Donlin.
And basically, what I said was after the fact, ""Just tell me, do you think it's there?"" He visited Donlin. He came back. And I asked him -- I actually
wrote this a couple of years ago in the annual report, but it bears repeating for what's going to happen next. And I asked him, I said, so are the 40
-- I said, ""Is it 40 million ounces?"" And he said, ""No."" I said, ""Is the gold there?"" He said, ""Yes."" And I said, ""So what's it about?""

And he said, ""I see 80 million to 100 million ounces, just a long strike."" And this was after we already owned it. So that was obviously a very, very
big moment for me because Larry had discovered the most important silver discovery of our generation in Bolivia, for me. And so Larry's credibility
was enormous, and it continues to the present day. He may have found something almost that big in Mexico again.

But be that as it may, when I went -- when I heard that, I decided I'll go to Barrick and try to buy the other half. When I went to visit Barrick, I met
with Aaron Regent, I took along with me, as a sidekick, a former ambassador who also happens to be a lawyer. And I met with Aaron and someone
else's name I will not mention because I haven't discussed talking about this anecdote. He's a very nice guy, and we've subsequently done very
nice business together. But for reasons which you'll understand, I'm not going to say his name in any event.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 When we sat down from each other, Aaron, who is a true gentleman and a man of incredible character and integrity and also with an absolutely
delightful personality, said, ""Well, what can we do for you?"" And I said, ""Look, I know this is really bad blood between Barrick and NovaGold. You
hate the CEO. You never want to say anything nice about it because you resent the fact that you lost the hostile takeover bid. So you won't do
anything to promote the asset. You basically only do what's the minimum you have to do to advance the project because you still can't forgive
NovaGold. And you don't want to give NovaGold an opportunity to hit you over the head and say, see, we were right that we didn't sell it to you
because it's so much bigger.""

I said, ""Why don't you just let me buy it from you?"" Well, Aaron being a gentleman, said that -- basically, he said, ""I didn't see that one coming. I
thought you were coming to sell the other half of Donlin to us."" And I said, ""No, I don't want to sell the other half. I want to buy you out."" Okay. The
fellow next to him nearly lunged across the table. And the best analogy for that is the Godfather. If any of you will recall, when Michael Corleone
goes to Vegas and tells Moe Green that he wants to buy him out. And Moe Green basically says, ""You want to buy me out? I buy you out."" And then
the language gets extremely colorful and I'd love to do that, but I don't think I should do that on a conference call. The point being that Aaron,
who had not been there during the hostile takeover days, wasn't as conversant on the bad blood with Barrick. But the other person was, and he
said, ""You don't buy us out. We buy you out. Why would we sell the other half of Donlin when we know that all we have to do is to continue drilling
there? And that -- just that drilling alone would give us another Kinross.""

So this was -- well, my basic response was, ""I take it that you're rejecting the offer, but I have to say that I am going to leave feeling even more
convinced that we did the right thing."" And the bottom line was relations started to improve because Aaron Regent is a really, really decent guy,
smart and of good nature, which is why I told him, as we subsequently became friends, that he'd never survive at Barrick because the culture at
Barrick is sort of like Caligula meets Albert Anastasia on a good day. A very, very Praetorian culture and not the kind of thing for someone with
Aaron's integrity. Be that as it may, relations improved.

Now one of the things that I've always wondered in my mind because I'm a historian by background, I'm not an engineer, I'm not a geologist, is
the great what if of gold mining in that era was, what if Barrick had paid an extra buck and bought NovaGold? Well, these are called counterfactuals,
pure speculation, obviously. But it's interesting because it's entirely possible. I know that they would have put 10 drill rigs on the property. And I
personally believe that they might very well have 9-digit gold ounces there if they'd have done that. I also think they would have drilled all over
the property. Because as we say in the mining industry, if you're going out in search of elephants, go to elephant country. That certainly worked
for me in Bolivia, in Africa, in Texas. Basically, everywhere where I've ever gone, we found districts. That's what we were looking on or looking for.

Now in the case of Barrick, they didn't win the bid. And in order to be able to grow as fast as they wanted to, they decided to build Pascua-Lama,
which a lot of people would say should never have been attempted. And in order to be able to get more copper, they went after Equinox. I should
mention, at that time, NovaGold had half or 70%, I don't remember, of what will, I believe, one day be the largest and lowest-cost producer of
copper in Canada. So they might not have needed Equinox. They might not have needed Pascua-Lama. And Barrick, which was the only AAA-rated
company in the gold industry at that time, certainly of any size, would be a very, very different place. It was such a high-quality story that they could
afford to make one monumental screw up, but 2 was just about too much and still they managed to survive it. That is endurance and sustainability.
Suffice to say that as things moved on and we became more friendly, I met Greg Lang. Greg was the President of Barrick North America. Greg, at
that time, was responsible for more production of gold than Goldcorp. And he was President for 8 years, and the entirety of his career had been
with Barrick or predecessor companies that had been acquired by Barrick. So this was not someone who we jokingly say is promiscuous and would
jump from company to company.

We found a very, very common bond in terms of how we both viewed Donlin. He as an engineer and a man who had been in mining projects all
over the world and had come to the conclusion that this will be the greatest gold mine, new gold mine in the world. I saw it the same way as an
investor. And he agreed to become the CEO of the company, I agreed to become Chairman. He went to Aaron. Aaron called me up and said that
he was going to try to keep Greg. And I said, ""Why don't we just agree that whatever Greg decides to do, we honor his decision and may the best
man win."" Okay. Greg and I came on board at NovaGold, and we set about changing the entire company, selling off the problem assets, spinning
off things that were not related to Donlin, quickly repairing the balance sheet, et cetera, et cetera. And every promise that we made, we kept.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Now as time passed and unfortunately my prediction regarding Aaron proved to be true, and Aaron was ousted in true Roman fashion and replaced
by Jamie Sokalsky another very, very nice guy. Barrick was going through a lot of trials and tribulations. And one of the things that they did was in
order to show that they would be exerting capital discipline in the Pascua-Lama era was basically to throw Donlin under the bus.

Now that did not mean that they weren't going to continue taking the thing along the value chain. Barrick never ever slowed anything down, but
it takes time to permit and so we continued meandering along. We called it the tortoise and the hare because other projects that people said would
be ahead of the line with us actually fell by the wayside for jurisdictional risk or for technical issues. And now it looks like the tortoise, at some point
in the future when the owners decide, is going to cross the finish line and in a very big, big dramatic way with crowd cheering. In any event, we
decided life is long. We're not going to make an issue. Barrick's got bigger problems than we do, and we decided we'll be good partners and just
take a stiff upper lip. Eventually, Jamie was replaced. John Thornton became the Chairman of Barrick and the co-CEOs, co-Presidents were Jim
Gowans and Kelvin Dushnisky.

Around this time, we started to hear from analysts that Barrick in their talks to analysts were talking about Donlin. This was a first for us, and we
were surprised. I reached out to John Thornton, and I said, ""Can Greg and I come to Toronto to see you?"" And so Greg and I made our way to Toronto.
We sat down with John, and we said, ""We've heard you've been saying very nice things about Donlin, something we should know?"" And John
looked at Jim Gowans, and he said, ""Look, when I came into the picture, I asked him, if we were going to grow where would we grow, what do we
have that's something that we can really sink our teeth into?"" And Jim Gowans said, ""I think Donlin is one of the best gold projects in the world.""
And John said, ""Wow, I didn't realize that.""

John and I got along really well and relations with Barrick improved markedly, not just because of that, but also the fact that we had so much Barrick
DNA in our management team. Greg Lang, of course; Richard Williams, who built Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic, a number of people who
-- Dave Deisley, who were ex-Barrick. So we had a lot, we still do, a lot of Barrick DNA, and that was really, really helpful.

Now the mutual respect extended all the way until Mark Bristow came into the story. As I said, I call Mark the white swan. And it's not just because
he says, things that I think are not just nice, but also accurate. I do believe that Donlin is a key asset for Barrick. I love the fact that they see it as a
new gold opportunity. The Barrick and the NovaGold teams worked absolutely beautifully. And for me, my experience with Mark going back to
African Platinum, when I asked him to join the Board, and he did, going back to the Kibali transaction and just the fact that we're friends, this is a
really, really wonderful thing.

But the most important thing is this, Mark is a pro, Mark has a very, very linear Cartesian view on how you take the geology, turn it into the right
geometry, make the perfect mine plan and the like. And that's what we're doing now. We've got everybody's attention, and we're doing it steadily
but surely. I never ask him, ""When are we going to go into production?"" And I know that it sounds funny, but I know that it will. If you're a bull on
gold and you want to be able to have a producer, a big producer that will go on for decades, Donlin is the best story in the world. I'm a bull on gold.
Ergo, to me, it's just a function of when the gold price is higher, when people want growth, where are they going to turn. It's very likely it's going
to be in United States or Canada or Australia. And we've got the tiger by the tail. It really is a holy grail.

And so when I talk about the next big discovery being potentially at Donlin, it's twofold. Number one, the Donlin Gold deposit where we have the
reserves is only 3 kilometers of what we already know is an 8-kilometer mineralized trend.

Hence, Larry Buchanan's comments, which may or may not ever come to pass. It's the ultimate forward-looking statement, but I believe he's right.
But more than that, that 8 kilometers only represents 5% of the total land package that we and Barrick control. When I say the next Donlin could
be a Donlin, it's because there is the entire possibility, conjecture, that we could deal with the district. Even if it didn't turn out to be a district and
there was no other Donlin there, we're still dealing with something that has the potential to have enough high-grade reserves really to be on par
with Nevada, and that would be good enough for me.

And so with that, we can go to the next slide. I think I've covered this point, but the truth is that for all of the reasons which I've outlined, the advent
of Warren Buffett anointing Barrick and the spotlight that that will put on Barrick's assets, has got to be a very, very good thing for us.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 But what's also so important for everyone to understand is that Warren Buffett coming into the gold story has effectively detoxified gold. He's made
it safe for anyone interested in gold to be looking at the gold narrative. Now we've been talking about this for a long time. And I've been commenting
that one of the beautiful things about gold, and we can go to the next slide, is that whether it's Ray Dalio or whether it is Jeff Gundlach or Paul
Tudor Jones or Ken Rogoff or Mark Mobius, you have so many different boldface names coming into what is still one of the most under owned
financial trades in the world. We haven't even -- we're not barely in the first inning of what we can see, if I'm right, that gold is going to embark,
with some volatility, shake out the weak hands, that's what it's supposed to do, on another decade-long leg in a secular bull market. But here we
are with people like Warren Buffet, people like Ray Dalio, looking at these things for the first time and looking at them with fresh eyes.

Next slide. An incredible example of this was the piece that was written by Mohamed El-Erian, who I know. It was on the front page of the New
York Times, and he basically described how he was so surprised that gold is evolving into a must-have asset. And gives all the reasons why different
people are looking at gold for different reasons, basically putting into those words, what I've said for a long time is that investors will have a buffet
from which to choose how they wish to justify to their investment committee adding an allocation in gold.

Suffice to say that I'm happy to answer questions on where the gold market is, but I think I've been doing that long enough with our shareholders
that you really do understand that we think we do understand what's going on with the gold market. If I'm right, gold is headed to at least $3,000
to $5,000 as an equilibrium level. And as I've said before, but I don't like to discredit myself by being too out there, I truly do believe that the chart
for gold will one day look very similar to the charts of the Dow after the Dow broke through 1,000 in the early 1980s. And draw any conclusion that
you wish from that very forward-looking statement.

Next slide. Suffice to say that we are in a long-term bull market for gold. The demand drivers are so numerous that it staggers the imagination.
From asset diversification, god knows that, that has been reinforced and validated this year. Safe haven appeals, ditto. Currency debasement
protection, ditto. Central bank purchasing, ditto. They are the ultimate insider buyers. They pulled back a little bit because prices are higher. My
guess is they will start to go back in again as more QE means that they want to be able to own the asset that they know has no counterparty risk.
There are people who are buying gold to protect against the depression. There are people who are buying gold to protect against runaway inflation.
There are some who say you need one or the other. The reality is gold responds very well to both.

And you've got emerging market demand. Who better than Ken Rogoff or Mark Mobius to know about the emerging markets and for Mark Mobius
to say, which he's been saying for hundreds and hundreds of dollars, buy gold at any price and obviously, correctly. Then you have the supply
pressures. The recovery rates collapsing. Exploration, not yielding anything. Decreasing ore grades. The majors are burning through their reserves
faster than they can replace them. As the grades go down, the production costs go higher. The jurisdictional risk is meant for things that people
thought might be developed won't be developed.

For all of these reasons, you're seeing a perfect storm in gold. That means that a prudent man has to have some gold. And if they don't now, they
ultimately will. Well, here's the thing. Even a 1% allocation of gold is going to lead to gold multiplying because most of the gold in the world is in
extremely sticky hands who have had nothing but positive reinforcement for owning it and protecting their livelihood. Whether it's Indians or
whether it's Chinese, these are very much gold and silver cultures. They understand it. They will continue to buy it over the long term at a time
when the West is seeing it as an asset class again. That has been revalidated not only by the macro circumstances, but by really smart money that
has given the really, really big money out there, the opportunity to take a look at gold. And as we know, the really, really, really big money really
starts to look at things after they've gone up dramatically in price. At that point, it starts to look interesting. You couldn't give Bitcoin away at a few
hundred bucks. But when it got to over $10,000, people were talking about ETFs. Welcome to that curiosity of the financial world, which is that if
something gets more expensive, it starts to look more beautiful and desirable and that also happens with other areas of life.

Next. For me and for our investors, we want the leverage to that higher gold price. But we want to be in a place that will allow us to keep it, that
won't turn around and say, ""Hey, you're making a windfall. We want part of that."" The leverage provided by NovaGold and by Donlin, for us and
for Barrick, is absolutely gorgeous. I do believe that at $2,000 gold, this is a $20 billion asset. We haven't even spoken about optimization. This is
not adding potentially more reserves or any other upsides. That's just merely a function of the fact that I think that very, very scarce North American
assets of high-quality size that moves the needle will be valued using 0% discount rates, especially if they have any exploration potential, and I
don't believe anyone has more exploration potential than Donlin.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Next. One of the beautiful things, as I mentioned, about NovaGold is that in addition to having a lot of cash where we don't need to raise more
money, we have a really, really, really interesting and smart investor base. And as more people are asking for brokers to give them exposure to
assets which are located in places that potentially they'd be willing to take their kids. Alaska with whale watching and salmon fishing falls into that
category. Australia, the Great Barrier Reef. Nevada, you've got gambling, you've got all the other fun things for the family in different places. You'd
be surprised, but the premium rating will be given for those assets which are in places where investors' ICs would say, ""If you're going to go on a
mine tour, are you willing to go there?"" And definitely, Donlin falls within that category. But more than that, when they look at our shareholder
base, what they're going to see is very, very smart money. And some of those new investors are already starting to call up these people and say,
""Hey, can you tell us more about this?"" And pretty much what they're hearing is that Donlin is unique, and this is a pure-play on what will be,
hopefully, the largest pure gold mine in the world over the course of time.

Next. Well, as all of you know, we had an incident with short selling earlier in the year. Up until that time, we were outperforming, by a wide margin,
the GDX, the GDXJ, not to mention other large individual companies. We've put that share performance behind us -- I mean, or the downdraft
behind us. And indeed, what we do believe is in the not-too-distant future, we're going to start seeing NovaGold reap the fruits of the great quarter
that we've had and continue to trade at a premium. I can certainly tell you that the management team and I are absolutely dedicated and committed
to making that happen. We believe we should trade at a premium, and we believe that the market will reward us for all of the factors that go into
making Donlin unique.

Next. Okay. And so with that, I don't need to cover all of these things, but the simple part about it is this, as an investor in the space, I cannot find
anything that gives me the attributes in combination that NovaGold gives me.

And that's because of the asset, so I didn't find it, I can't take credit for it. But the fact is it is a brilliant asset in the best part of the world. And I do
believe that you will see us reap the rewards from our investor base, analyst base and all other ways that will allow us to achieve the objectives
that we've set out for us. Thank you very much.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions)

Our first question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes - B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
Thank you, Tom, for a quarterly description. It's always really interesting to hear the history of this truly unique asset. So I appreciate that. I wanted
to ask a little bit more about the initial drill assays. And you noted in the presentation that they exceeded model expectations with multiple
significant distinct high-grade intervals. And I wanted to ask, could you maybe frame the exceptional results there? In what areas specifically on
what metrics did they exceed your expectations?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
Lucas, I'll take that question. Our drill program has 2 objectives this year. One, validate the new model. That's about half of the holes. And the other
is to look for extensions to the known high-grade mineralizations we would mine early in the project's life. And a couple of those holes where the
grade came in relatively shallow, around 30, 40 meters. I think that was exactly what we were looking for was extensions to the high grade. The
intrusive structures that carry the grade come up like a series of fingers through the sediment rock around them. And as our modeling focused on
the intrusives and their high-grade nature, we really saw the opportunity that with small equipment, you can mine these discretely and selectively
and enhance the grade. So the -- to answer your question, we have a model, and as results come in, we compare them to anticipated intervals.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And across the board, what I'd say we're seeing is less thickness, but it's substantially higher grade, which is exactly what we were hoping to find
through this program. And we'll do to release the next set of results later this month. And we continue to be really encouraged by what we see
and that there is a very real opportunity for us to add value by drilling.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes - B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
And I heard you right there you said additional results should be forthcoming later this month?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
That is correct, yes. Assay turnaround times has been slow this year related to staffing issues at the laboratories caused by COVID. But we're working
our way through that, and we're starting to get more coming in every day. So look for something -- an update later in the month.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes - B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
And Greg, would you be able to share what percent of the drill program would be released at that point?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
Lucas, we're getting assays in all the time. The initial results we released were about 10% of the program, and we anticipate maybe the next 20%
of the drilling with the balance to follow later in the year.

Lucas Nathaniel Pipes - B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
Very helpful. And then one more question for me today. Can you speak a little bit about the alignment between Barrick and NovaGold at this time
in regards to the development of Donlin? And what is the risk, for example, that Barrick would like to go forward with Donlin development but
NovaGold isn't or vice versa? Would appreciate any thoughts on that framework.

Thomas Scott Kaplan - NovaGold Resources Inc. - Chairman of the Board
Greg, do you want me to take it?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
Why don't you start, Tom, and I'll fill in any gaps if needed.

Thomas Scott Kaplan - NovaGold Resources Inc. - Chairman of the Board
Sure. Look, from an operational standpoint, Greg will provide his answer. From the very bird's eye view, we have never been more aligned with
Barrick than we are today.

The fact that we've just completed the biggest drill program in the 12 years in which I've been in the company -- or as an investor in the company
is a very big statement. The fact that Mark has been out there and then approved this drill program. Mark has taken the attitude, as I said, he has
described it as a key asset, a nice clean gold opportunity, new opportunity. All of these things are extremely heartwarming. And they indicate that
                                                                                                                                                                             
 we are -- where Donlin is being viewed for a lot of good reasons, the permits and everything else, as being in a very different class than it was 12
years ago.

The methodical way in which Randgold works on being able to get the geometry down just right on the deposit in order to plan the optimal
throughput and therefore, to be able to tell us and everyone else what the CapEx will be, this is exactly the way that smart, prudent operators take
what will be the largest gold mine, pure gold mine in the world ultimately, up the value chain.

There is complete and utter alignments. As to when it goes into production, it takes two to tango. Our attitude is Barrick has more needs, in effect,
for production as a large-scale gold producer. And when they decide that this falls into that category and want to take it forward, we have 0 doubt
that we have access to whatever capital we need to meet our needs. And I think it's inevitable. The only question is when, and that will be done
when Mark views it as being optimal for his shareholders and when we do for ours. I have no doubt that we will be in sync at that time. Everything
that we've seen since the Randgold-Barrick merger has confirmed that this really is a game-changing event for us.

We have people in charge who really love to build great projects. They know how to do it right. And candidly, when the time comes, I don't think
there'll be any stronger promoters of the assets than they are. We're one voice, but Barrick is the 800-pound gorilla in the mining industry.

And when they put Donlin on the map, it's going to be transformative. Let them do it right. They're taking ownership of the story after their merger.
As far as we're concerned, it couldn't be going better. Greg?

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
All right. Well, thank you for that, Tom. Well, Lucas, I'll tell you great drill results are exciting in any company, and I think that's especially true with
a geologic-focused company and CEO like Mark. But to answer your question, day-to-day interactions are very common right now with the geologists
and the technical people as the results come in. And yes, it's really exciting to see that Barrick brings a lot to the party in that regard. And Catherine
Raw, who is their senior executive with responsibility for North American operations is the Chairman of Donlin Gold this year, and she's also very
involved. So yes, I would say that Barrick is probably -- this is as great an involvement as they've had since the preparation of the feasibility study
back in 2010 and '11. Nice to see, very capable people there.

Melanie Hennessey - NovaGold Resources Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications
We have one more question coming online, and I'll just read it out.

Is it fair to say that at the current price, NG stock is a bet on the future rise in the gold price and additional exploration potential at Donlin?

Thomas Scott Kaplan - NovaGold Resources Inc. - Chairman of the Board
Short answer, no.

Melanie Hennessey - NovaGold Resources Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications
Tom, you want to...

Thomas Scott Kaplan - NovaGold Resources Inc. - Chairman of the Board
Yes. The short answer is no. The longer answer is hell no. That's a thing I picked up in Texas. The reality is that we view NovaGold as substantially
undervalued in the marketplace. We don't have any doubt that we're going to regain the premium rating that we had. But if you look at what --
where we should be, in our view, if we had not been the results -- or the victim of a securities fraud, then I think we would have seen the stock

                                                                                                                                                                             
 already in the high teens, $20, maybe pulling back a bit with the rest of the industry. But our history over the last year, certainly since permitting
and all of those good things, is that we outperformed the indexes. And so by that measure, catching up, and in fact, now surpassing where we
were when the short report came out is an indication that, that's being put behind us because, candidly, there was no merit to it.

But we want to see that the stock regain the premium rating that it should have. Adding reserves and higher gold price, that will just put fuel on
the fire. But I've always said, even when the stock was with a 3-handle or a 4-handle, that we saw ourselves going into the $20s and considerably
beyond that. Everything that's happened since we made those statements -- obviously, forward-looking, but since we made those statements,
we've only had good reaffirmation of the reasons why we made those statements. And so that's the long answer of saying we are not -- or the stock
-- the stock price does not reflect today where we think it really should be. Higher gold prices, obviously, and more exploration, that's all going to
only be icing on the cake.

Melanie Hennessey - NovaGold Resources Inc. - VP of Corporate Communications
Thank you, Tom. There are no further questions. So I hand the call back over to Greg for closing remarks.

Gregory A. Lang - NovaGold Resources Inc. - President, CEO & Non-Independent Director
Well, thank you, Melanie. It's already been a fairly lengthy call. So thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Stay safe. Goodbye.

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Good morning, and thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. I hope that you, your families, your friends and neighbors are all healthy and well.

Today, we are resuming our practice of holding quarterly earnings conference calls after an unfortunately prolonged absence. As you know, on
February 14, we suspended quarterly earnings reporting when it was determined that we needed to restate fiscal 2018 financials as well as the
first 3 quarters of fiscal 2019 before completing the audit and filing our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019.

We are finalizing our second quarter financial report, and we will release these results as soon as they are complete. We're hopeful that we will be
current with the SEC reporting requirement with the filing of our third quarter results sometime in late 2020.

I'm going to devote my prepared remarks today to our first quarter performance, record defense backlog, our near-term priorities and other factors
that give us confidence that we will deliver revenue growth and improved profitability for 2020. Tom will provide you with a detailed review of
our financial results for the first quarter and the terms of our new amended credit facility. And then I will offer some concluding remarks before
opening the line to your questions.

Starting on Slide 4. Item 1 is a summary of our first quarter results. As I hope to make clear in my prepared remarks this morning, we believe that
these results are not indicative of our expected performance for fiscal year 2020.

The first quarter decline in revenue was largely a matter of timing as we had significant revenue in the first quarter of 2019 for our Next Generation
Jammer Mid-Band pod we produced for Raytheon Technologies. The engineering and manufacturing development phase of the NGJ Mid-Band
pod program was virtually complete by the end of 2019 and there was little revenue for this program in the first quarter of this year.

CPI Aero has recently begun the system development and test phase of the program, and we expect that this will be a strong revenue program
during the second half of 2020. Additionally, revenue declined as our commercial programs had lower demand even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic
that, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, resulted in deferred and canceled orders for certain business jet programs.

An unfavorable product mix also negatively affected margins during the quarter, created largely by the reduction in the NGJ Mid-Band pod program
revenue mentioned above. We also revised our estimate for our factory overhead rate for 2020 that had a cumulative catch-up effect on program
profitability that resulted in a gross profit of 4% for the quarter.

We expect that margins will trough in 1 -- in the first quarter of '20, and that full year 2020 gross margin percentage will be higher than it was in
2019 as our product mix for the remainder of 2020 returns to a more favorable mix between commercial and defense programs. Despite the
reported GAAP net loss, our continued focus on working capital management resulted in an improvement in cash flow from operations of
approximately $900,000.

Moving to the second bullet on that page. Since the beginning of the year, we have announced $77.4 million in new firm orders, reflecting our
consistently strong performance on high-quality, multiyear defense programs.

On the E-2D program with Northrop Grumman, we received $48.1 million in new firm orders for wing kits and $4 million in firm orders for welded
assemblies. We have received $1.2 million follow-on order from Lockheed Martin for F-16 structural assemblies, $14 million in new purchase orders
under our A-10 rewinging contract with Boeing, and we received $10.1 million in purchase orders from the U.S. Air Force for T-38 modification kits.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 By leveraging our established and long-standing relationships with the largest aerospace OEMs, we ended the first quarter with a record total
backlog of $556.3 million and a record $499 million in defense backlog. As a result of strong bookings during the quarter, book-to-bill for the quarter
was 4.7:1 and is 2.2:1 for the trailing 12-month period. We ended the quarter with a funded defense backlog of $206.4 million, up $69.4 million
since December 31, 2019.

The largest programs in this funded backlog are the E-2D wing panel kits we supply to Northrop Grumman, A-10 assemblies we built for Boeing
and our Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band pod program we performed for Raytheon.

Turning to Slide 5. As you can see from the line chart on the right side of the slide, we are reaping the reward of successful execution of a strategy
started around 3 years ago to concentrate on building our backlog of long-term defense programs.

We have seen a $165 million spike in our backlog of long-term defense contracts over just the past 4 quarters. As a result, 90% of our backlog as
of March 31 consists of multiyear defense contracts. However, our commercial business has been facing headwinds from the global COVID-19
pandemic and from order cancellations and deferred deliveries.

Our backlog of commercial contracts decreased $7.9 million to $57 million as of March 31, with the funded portion decreasing $6 million to $4.7
million due to reductions in order quantities on the HondaJet and Gulfstream programs. After the end of the first quarter, Triumph Group canceled
nearly all open orders with us, decreasing the G650 leading edge backlog by an additional $3.6 million. In May, Triumph Group announced it had
reached an agreement in principle to sell the G650 wing program to Gulfstream Aerospace.

We have begun to receive communications from Gulfstream that are expected to lead to purchase orders for G650 wing components. However,
the company is unable to predict at this time when Gulfstream will begin purchasing G650 wing components from us, if at all, or how many.

Most of what remains in our commercial backlog are 2 multi-year programs with Embraer. As of March 31, our funded backlog stood at $211 million,
of which $206 million were for defense industry customers. The current defense backlog is scheduled to convert to revenue over an approximate
24-month period and is expected to generate in the aggregate positive operating margins and cash flow.

Slide 6 displays the broad array of high-value defense platforms we are supporting. On one hand, we have contracts that support legacy aircraft
like the A-10, F-16 and T-38. On the other hand, we are working on military programs for technologically advanced systems like the F-35, Next
Generation Jammer and other undisclosed pod and missile platforms that are aligned with defense department priorities and have CPI positioned
for growth and margin expansion in 2020 and beyond.

I'll now turn the call over to Tom Powers, our acting CFO, who will walk you through our financial results for the quarter as well as the amended
credit facility with BankUnited. Tom?

Thomas E. Powers - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - Acting CFO & Secretary
Thank you, Doug. I'll start my remarks on Slide 8. As a reminder, results for the first quarter of 2019 are the restated values as found on Form 10-Q/A
filed with the SEC [25th].

Revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $16.9 million compared to $22 million for the same period last year. As Doug mentioned, the lower revenue
was primarily attributable to the Raytheon Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band pod, wherein we had essentially completed Phase 1 development
by the end of 2019. We have recently transitioned to a new development phase on this program.

In addition, revenue for our commercial programs declined $1.2 million, reflecting continued weak demand for business jets. Gross profit was $0.7
million compared to $2.5 million, reflecting, in part, an unfavorable product mix as a result of lower revenue on the Raytheon pod program. We
also revised and increased our factory overhead rate forecast for 2020 on all contracts to account for the lower absorption of fixed costs largely
resulting from the Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band pod production gap and the anticipated impact of the pandemic on certain commercial
programs.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 This revision resulted in a onetime cumulative catch-up on program profitability and pulled gross profit down to 4% for the quarter. We expect
full year 2020 gross margin percentage will be higher than it was in 2019 as our product mix for the remainder of 2020 returns to a more favorable
mix between commercial and defense programs.

SG&A expenses increased 6% to $3.1 million compared to $2.9 million and included approximately $578,000 in nonrecurring accounting and legal
expenses related to the restatement and the ongoing litigation resulting from the restatement. Combination of lower gross profit and higher SG&A
expenses resulted in a net loss of $2.8 million or $0.24 per share for the quarter.

Slide 9 presents our balance sheet highlights. Cash and restricted cash stood at $3.4 million as of March 31. Net contract assets and liabilities were
$11.1 million compared to $11.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The vast majority of contract assets at March 31, 2020, consists of physical
inventory that will be used for the fulfillment of firm orders to customers. Total debt was $30.4 million, including $26.7 million outstanding under
our revolver.

Also as disclosed in an 8-K filing and in our earnings release for the fourth quarter, on August 24, we finalized an amendment to our credit facility
with BankUnited. Under this agreement, the maturity of the credit facility has been extended to May 2, 2022, and $6 million of the outstanding
balance under the revolver has been converted to and added to the term loan. As a result, the outstanding principal of the term loan has increased
to approximately $8 million, and availability under the revolver has been permanently reduced to $24 million.

And as a reminder, in April, we received a $4.8 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program Provision of the CARES Act. We expect the PPP
loan to be converted into a grant before the end of the year.

I'll now turn the call back to Doug.

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Tom. Turning to Slide 11. Our defense backlog consists of multiyear programs, many of which have life remaining through at least 2025.
A few noteworthy programs that we have either won recently or have had extended recently by customers include the following.

E-2D Advanced Hawkeye was the second 5-year contract for Northrop Grumman and the potential for additional growth as the U.S. Navy plans an
expansion of the program of record and anticipates additional foreign military sales orders.

Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band Pod program. This has significant upside as the program moves through system development and demonstration
and into low-rate initial production and then full-rate production. We estimate this program has the potential to generate an additional $150 million
in revenue for CPI Aero over a roughly 10-year production period.

A-10 rewing program with Boeing. The program is just spooling up, and a significant portion of the backlog is already funded.

T-38 Pacer Classic III TRIM program. We are the prime contractor to the U.S. Air Force in support of extending the life of the T-38 trainer airframe.
Program is valued at more than $65 million, with orders being placed multiple times per year.

And finally, the F-16 Rudder Island Drag Chute Canister Assembly. Significant growth potential with Lockheed recently announcing a $5 billion
deal for 90 aircraft for Taiwan and Morocco, and they've negotiated pricing with U.S. Air Force for additional countries considering the F-16.

Turning to Slide 12. In Aerosystems and Aerostructures, we have attractive term program opportunities that should allow us to end the year with
an increased book of business, particularly for those programs where we're already the incumbent and to sustain momentum in our defense
business.

Turning to Slide 13. I wanted to spend some time on today's call discussing our outlook for 2020 and our priorities over the next several quarters.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 First, the pandemic has galvanized our focus on liquidity, cash preservation and the efficient use of capital. Like many companies, we have experienced
supply chain disruptions, higher-than-normal employee absenteeism, suspensions in manufacturing at some customer facilities.

While New York was in lockdown during the spring, our classification as an essential business sustained our defense business but could not cushion
us from slowdowns in our commercial business as demand for business jets has all but evaporated, and the disparity and profitability between our
defense and commercial programs has widened. In response to these challenging circumstances, toward the end of the first quarter, we took
immediate action, curtailing discretionary spending, implementing a hiring freeze and reducing staff.

After the first quarter ended, we were quick to act on new government programs aimed at improving liquidity of businesses impacted by the
coronavirus. We qualified for and received a $4.8 million Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act, which enabled us to retain our
workforce, preventing further job cuts at CPI.

We have also taken the opportunity to look at our operations, attacking waste and reengineering several processes to enhance capital efficiency.
For instance, we are focused on compressing the cash cycle for each program by shortening build time and more closely managing the flow of
materials into our operations.

Keep in mind that the cash cycle of our defense programs is better than our commercial business, and therefore, continuing to increase the mix
of defense business will inherently help improve cash conversion. We believe the cash saved from these working capital improvement initiatives,
careful control of inventory levels and continued cost management will largely offset the cash we expect to pay for nonrecurring professional
expenses in 2020.

Second, through these various liquidity enhancement measures, we intend to strengthen our balance sheet. Our goal is to apply the increased
operating cash generation to paying down approximately $2 million of debt in 2020.

Third, margin expansion is a key priority for us. As our newer defense programs start to hit our assembly floor over the latter part of 2020, we expect
the increased direct labor hours will improve overhead absorption and convert to higher profit margins across our portfolio of products.

Higher revenue and the improved payment posture we should have with key supply chain partners could also help improve our buying leverage
and over time, lead to improved bill and material costs. Approximately 65% of our direct costs are from materials we purchased from suppliers, so
even a small improvement can lead to big improvements in cash and margin.

And by putting behind us this year's professional fees and certain COVID-19-related costs, which, combined, we estimate will amount to approximately
$1.5 million, we'll have a more typical SG&A cost structure starting in 2021 and be positioned to realize operating leverage on rising revenue.

These 3 near-term priorities will set the table for what we believe will be a much improved 2021 where we project higher revenue, improved
profitability and cash flow compared to 2020. The goal is to use the increased cash flow to accelerate debt repayment to further deleverage the
company and provide a solid foundation for 2022 and beyond.

On Slide 14, using 2018 revenue as a baseline, we are providing our growth outlook for the 3-year period 2018 to 2021 in each of our business
areas. In Aerostructures, we started $35.1 million in revenue in fiscal '18. On the strength of new contracts with Lockheed for F-16 assemblies and
Boeing for the A-10, we believe this business will grow in the range of 12% to 14% through 2021.

The bulk of our commercial revenue are in this Aerostructures business area. And as such, this growth rate projection has no contribution from
potential future orders by Gulfstream for G650 leading edges, and it does include the impact of COVID-19 to our other business jet programs.

Aerosystems remains our fastest-growing area, driven by our electronic warfare pods and electronic systems programs. This is a great niche for us,
one that we believe can generate growth across the programs indicated at a 3-year compound annual growth rate in the range of 22% to 26%.
This is largely driven off of expected increased production of the various electronic warfare and intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance pods
we built for Raytheon and Northrop Grumman as well as increased orders for certain BLACK HAWK systems from Sikorsky.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 In our kitting and supply chain management area at the bottom, we started a revenue base of $17.7 million for fiscal '18. We believe that the funded
orders we received for the E-2D program and the T-38 program, among others, should produce a compound annual growth rate in the range of
8% to 10%.

Before opening the call to questions, I'd like to say in closing that we are now reaping the rewards of our efforts to foster durable relationships with
the premier aerospace and defense OEMs and win long-term contracts. Thanks to our high-quality backlog and record funded defense backlog,
we are well-positioned with a stable business near term.

And because we have earned a reputation as an exceptional, reliable supply chain partner, we plan to leverage these relationships to bid on and
win new awards, giving us attractive long-term growth opportunities. In fact, our business defense -- our defense business is at the starting block
of what could be decades-long programs.

Finally, I want to recognize the dedication of our employees who have risen to the occasion these past several months to continue their work in
service of our country's national security. They have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances, and they have my heartfelt thanks.

Elisa, you can open the line for questions, please.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Ken Herbert of Canaccord Genuity.

Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD and Senior Aerospace & Defense Analyst
Doug, I just wanted to first ask around gross margins. Can you provide a little bit of -- just maybe a bit more specific on the EACs in the quarter.
Sorry if I missed it. And to get to obviously better gross margin this year than in 2019 implies a pretty nice ramp over the second, third and fourth
quarters. Can you just talk about the sequential improvement we should expect as we go through the growth of the year on the gross margin?

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I don't want to specify by quarter, but I can tell you that the cumulative effect of the change in our EACs for the quarter was roughly around
$1 million. And so we don't have that headwind in the second, third and fourth quarters.

And so when you -- I would prefer to leave it as we've publicly stated, which our gross margin at the end of the year will be higher than '19 without
going into how we think that will ramp up over the period. But we would expect our fourth quarter to be the highest gross profit margin quarter
of the year.

Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD and Senior Aerospace & Defense Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And appreciate the details on the slides. I know obviously you haven't been able to say much. But as you look at sort of your
revised outlook for 2021, is just to apply these growth rates, I get to revenues next year sort of well over $100 million, maybe $105 million, $110
million, somewhere in that range depending upon the growth rate. Can you just talk through -- I know you've outlined a lot of these. Just maybe
talk through your confidence in those 2021 numbers with the backlog and a couple of the key moving pieces as we think about the step-up
obviously from '19 to '20 to '21.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
The -- I can say it's a very high confidence in the growth rate. And the derivation that you picked is in line with our own internal thinking at the
moment. And I would say that the vast majority of that is already in the funded backlog.

So things that could derail that, obviously, a program execution. We have to execute on the backlog and deliver it when the customer wants it. But
that's just an ordinary risk. And the risk of -- always the risk of an order cancellation here and there. But I can tell you that there is not a lot of white
space in the forecast for 2021 revenue.

Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD and Senior Aerospace & Defense Analyst
Okay. And then just finally, can you just walk through -- I mean, obviously, a lot has happened over the last several months. Can you just walk
through maybe some of the changes you've put in place just regarding on the finance and control side as we think about coming out of the
restatement and what you can say that will give investors confidence you're moving forward that, obviously, all those issues are behind us, and
you feel very good about what's in place now moving forward.

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, as we stated, this was a long and complex issue that we had to address after we announced that we discovered the error. So one of the first
things that the Board directed we do, and we did do, was hire a Big 4 advisory firm with expertise in this particular area to help Tom and the team
develop very detailed and complete processes on how to recognize revenue for its various types of contracts that we get.

That has already been done, and we are -- and we use those to develop the 2018 and '19 restatement as well as, of course, the first quarter. We still
have work to do on the remediation side, a lot of training. We still have to get comfortable that the internal controls are tested, so we have to have
time during the year to do those tests. But we're highly confident, and I know our Board is highly confident that the steps that we have in place
now are the right ones. And we'll document the remediation effort in future quarterly reports.

Kenneth George Herbert - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD and Senior Aerospace & Defense Analyst
Okay. And just finally, it sounds like you expect the second quarter results out maybe in the next couple of weeks. Is there anything else specifically
you can say on timing?

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. It might be a little longer than the next few weeks. Honestly, I'd rather not -- we have until -- October 15 was our deadline to get some of the
-- kind of get current. I don't expect that we'll achieve that. So you can probably look towards maybe the end of October, early November-ish for
the second quarter and near to the end of the year for the third quarter.

Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug McCrosson, CEO, for any closing remarks.

Douglas J. McCrosson - CPI Aerostructures, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Elisa, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Tom and I look forward to speaking to you again soon when we report on the
second quarter results. Thank you.

PRESENTATION
Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
Good morning, and welcome to Lamprell's 2020 Interim Results Presentation. My name is Christopher McDonald, and I'm the CEO. Joining me on
this call is our CFO, Tony Wright.

The picture shown on this opening slide is one of the batches of our offshore wind foundations we built arising at the U.K. marshalling yard prior
to their installation in the North Sea earlier this year. It is undeniable that the topic of energy transition has moved to the fore. What is particularly
noticeable to me is that the tone of debate has shifted from if and by how much to how fast can we get there.

At Lamprell, we embraced this shift 4 years ago and since have established ourselves as a leader in offshore wind foundation. I will touch upon the
subject of renewables and in particular, offshore wind throughout today's presentation, including our views of this fast-growing industry and how
we're using digital technology to drive improvements in our end markets of renewables and oil and gas.

I would like to draw your attention to Slide 2 and remind the audience of the disclaimer relating to forward-looking statements.

On Slide 3 is the agenda for this morning's call. I will first discuss the group's year-to-date 2020 highlights, followed by a review of our group
performance, including an update on our operations and bid pipeline before handing it over to Tony to walk you through the financials. I will then
conclude by addressing progress made with respect to our strategic initiatives and close out by addressing our outlook at which time we will open
it up for Q&A.

Pictured on Slide 4 is a welding robot and is one of several components of our digital strategy, which we have been working on over the last few
years. The technology was successfully deployed on the Moray East offshore wind project earlier this year. Robots are hardly new. But this is adaptive,
which means we can move it around their facility with minimal setup, which is a huge advantage.

Another key attribute is that we have begun to teach the robot digitally so that it can weld automatically regardless of position and ambient
conditions.

Turning to Slide 5 and to the year-to-date highlights. I cannot underscore enough how pleased I am with this set of results. It is both a testament
to the merits of the strategy we set out several years ago and to the tireless efforts and dedication of the entire Lamprell team in face of unprecedented
challenges.

Throughout 2020, we made very good progress with respect to our strategic goals and significantly improved our financial performance despite
the twin headwinds of a worldwide pandemic and low oil prices. Specifically, we have finalized contracts totaling circa $575 million in the first half,
including the award of 2 new build jackups from the IMI, the supply of 30 wind turbine foundations for the Seagreen offshore wind projects in the
North Sea and closer to home, the engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning of a new 25-kilometer export line for the Mahani gas
development in Sharjah.

Meanwhile, a few weeks ago, we delivered the last batch foundations for the Moray East wind farm. This is a great accomplishment, especially in
light of the ongoing operational challenges arising from the global pandemic.

During the period, we progressed a number of strands of our digital strategy, including the aforementioned welding robot, finalized the deal with
Akselos to utilize and market digital twins and advanced our joint venture with Injazat, which is initially focusing on asset integrity solutions for
our customers.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 With respect to our financial performance, our first half revenue was USD 142.5 million, representing a 34% increase as compared to the same
period in 2019. Meanwhile, EBITDA was a positive USD 300,000, while our net loss for the period was $19.6 million, excluding exceptional restructuring
costs and noncash impairments.

As at 30 June, we were debt-free with all of our assets unencumbered. Meanwhile, net cash increased to USD 71.4 million at 30 June, from USD
42.5 million at 31 December 2019. Pleasingly, and subject to audit, our net cash continued to rise post period and as at 30 September, that is
yesterday, our net cash stood at approximately $125 million. And lastly, backlog increased to $580 million at 30 June.

Before moving to operational highlights, the picture on Slide 6 is a great example of how we've invested in our facilities, particularly as it relates
to offshore wind. In 2019, we invested in building a growing line, that is a production line with a series of overhead cranes. This investment helped
improve operational efficiencies for the Moray East project and it is very satisfying to see that these efforts have translated to the bottom line.

Now turning to Slide 7 and a few words on COVID. Firstly, I am pleased to report that our yards in the UAE continue to be fully operational. 70% of
our professional staff are continuing to work remotely with screening and contact tracing protocols in place since February for all persons entering
our facilities.

We have a trained professional medical staff at our facilities providing round-the-clock support and have secured separate accommodation for
those requiring isolation. We have also recently begun surveillance testing for our yard staff as an additional layer of protection. Despite the
challenges, we are making good progress with all our projects, although we are seeing incremental additional costs and lower productivity associated
with the preventative measures that we have implemented at our facilities.

And lastly, given the extreme uncertainty, we took the decision in April to temporarily reduce fees, salaries and allowance for all employees, including
the Board, by 25%. This decision is anticipated to yield a cash savings of approximately $10 million for 2020.

Moving to Slide 8 into operational highlights. Firstly, with respect to health and safety, I am very pleased that our 12-month trailing total recordable
injury rate, TRIR, as at 30 June 2020, was 0.16, marking continued excellent group-wide safety performance. Last month, we delivered the last batch
of jackets for the Moray East offshore wind project. In total, 48 jackets were successfully delivered to the client at our UAT site.

Offshore wind is a core market for us and represents a key element of our growth strategy, which I will discuss a little bit later on in the presentation.
Meanwhile, the 2 IMI rigs are tracking to plan with fabrication activities well underway. The first half was very active for us in rig refurbishment
projects, which has continued throughout the summer and into Q4, while our services business, while initially impacted by the pandemic in Q2,
has since started to normalize.

Earlier this year, we implemented certain restructuring actions, which resulted in approximately $20 million in annualized cost reductions as
compared to 2019. We achieved this by optimizing our operational footprint by consolidating into our biggest and most versatile yard in Hamriyah.
In doing so, we took an additional 140,000 square meters of space, which is shown on the graphic on the right hand of the slide. In the meantime,
we have mothballed our Jebel Ali facility, which will work -- which time work volumes justify reactivation and have exited our Sharjah facility last
month.

Moving on to new contract awards on Slide 9. As previously announced and in addition to the IMI rigs awarded in January of this year, we had 2
other noteworthy awards in the first half. The first is for the Seagreen project in the U.K. North Sea, our third offshore wind project. We will be
supplying 30 wind turbine generator substructures, including the jacket transition pieces and suction bucket. Fabrication has already begun in our
yard with expected completion in the second half of 2021.

The second award is for the Mahani gas field, which is closer to home in the UAE. Mahani is a new discovery with significant strategic potential.
Our scope of work includes engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning of a new 25-kilometer export pipeline for the Sharjah
National Oil Company in partnership with Eni.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Turning to Page 10 and to the bid pipeline. As at 30 June 2020, our pipeline of opportunities was USD 5.5 billion, down from USD 6.2 billion as at
31 December 2019. Unsurprisingly, this decline was largely due to a reduction in our oil and gas segment, while opportunities in renewables remain
steady.

Post period, however, the total pipeline has returned to growth and now has increased to back over $6 billion, driven by additional opportunities
in the U.S. offshore wind market. Over time, we expect offshore wind will constitute an ever-larger percentage of our overall bid pipeline. Meanwhile,
the opportunities in oil and gas are largely made up of projects in the Middle East, namely Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The bidding levels and project scopes on the LTA program remain consistent with our original estimates at around $3 billion. We remain very
disciplined as to how we identify, pursue and differentiate ourselves with respect to new business and remain confident as to the quality of our
pipeline, given current circumstances.

With that, I'll turn it over to Tony to walk you through the financials.

Antony Wright - Lamprell plc - CFO & Executive Director
Thanks, Chris, and hello to everyone joining us on the webcast today. My name is Tony Wright, and I'm the CFO for the Lamprell Group. The picture
you can see on Slide 11 is the lifting of a transition piece for the Moray East project, a project that has manifested our experience and strategy in
renewables and has shown a positive impact on our financial performance in the first half of 2020, as we will see in a later slide.

Moving to Slide 12. And I'm pleased to report that a series of actions taken at the start of the year, coupled with excellent operational delivery, has
given us a set of results with improving profitability and cash. Our EBITDA for the first half of 2020 was positive at $300,000, a significant improvement
of nearly $30 million on the previous year.

The principal drivers to this improvement have been our ongoing projects generating positive margins and our decisive action to optimize and
reduce overheads as part of our organizational restructuring in the face of the challenging market and then COVID-19. Our net loss for the first half
of 2020, including exceptional restructuring costs and noncash impairments, was $27.1 million, a decrease in losses of $24.8 million on the same
period in 2019.

When the exceptional and noncash items are excluded, our net loss for the first half of 2020 decreased further to $19.6 million. The exceptional
and noncash charges totaled $7.4 million during the period, of which $4.2 million relates to a noncash impairment of some of our assets and is
based on an interim review of the business's property, plant and equipment and investments in associates. $3.2 million relates to the overhead
restructuring program and the closure of the Sharjah yard. We expect a further $4.3 million of restructuring costs to be incurred in the second half
of 2020.

In the first half of 2020, excluding the exceptional charges I've just referred to, we have reduced our overhead by 31% to $35.1 million. This is a
result of the operational restructuring and significant overhead reduction plan put in place at the beginning of the year as well as COVID-19-specific
cost-cutting measures. I will provide more detail on overheads in a later slide.

Our revenue for the first half of 2020 is $142.5 million, an increase of 34% on the same period of 2019. We expect revenues in the second half to
be stronger as the IMI rigs and Seagreen projects ramp up. The table on the right shows our revenue mix for the first half of 2020, which continues
to be dominated by the EPCI segment with the majority of the revenue in the period, being from the Moray East project.

We have seen strong growth in our rig refurbishment business with a portfolio of projects that have been executed well and have been profitable.
Our services businesses, in particular, our O&M business, also continue to perform solidly, providing a steady flow of revenue and profit.

In May, I said our focus was to preserve and enhance our liquidity. And I am pleased to confirm that we have delivered on that, reporting a net cash
position of $71.4 million at 30 of June, an increase of $28.9 million in the first half of the year.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We remain debt-free and have the capability of raising project-related facilities from our banks when needed, as demonstrated by the facility put
in place with HSBC on the Seagreen project. The debt market is challenging, but our relationship banks continue to support us.

So turning to Slide 13. Returning the group with positive EBITDA in the first half of 2020 was critical to navigating the current market conditions
and continuing this trend supports our focus on maintaining liquidity. This familiar chart sets out in more detail the factors that have contributed
to the move, positive EBITDA.

The first half of 2020 was a critical period on the Moray East project as we progressed through final fabrication stages and deliveries to the client
in line with project scheduling. The project has delivered strong margin and demonstrates how our experience in renewables continues to grow.
An excellent project, both financially and technically.

Our other value streams, in particular, rig refurbishment and O&M, have performed very well in the first half of 2020. Revenue levels within the rig
refurbishment business have increased and margins have held up well. Revenue levels within O&M have reduced due to COVID-19-related
demobilizations, but the business continues to make good profits.

COVID-19 has impacted our business in many ways, but as Chris mentioned earlier, we have dealt with it well and continue to do so. Putting
measures in place to deal with the crisis, whilst continuing to deliver for our clients, has cost us $1.2 million of direct overheads in the first half of
2020. These costs are mainly associated with social distancing measures we had to put in place, a simple example of which were the additional
buses required moving our staff to and from the yard to allow for extra spacing.

However, these overheads and the lower productivity arising from COVID-19 that has pressured project margins have been more than offset by
the salary and fee deductions implemented on 1st April this year. Salary deduction was one of the main contributors to delivering the overhead
reduction in the first half of the year. The other primary reason for the reduction was the organizational changes we made at the beginning of the
year before COVID-19 swept across the globe.

Taking such a significant amount of overhead out of the business was difficult and challenging, but necessary to deliver positive EBITDA in the first
half of the year and sustainable profitability as we move forward.

So moving on to Slide 14. I introduced this slide in May to assist the understanding of our overhead structure as we move forward, and it now gives
clarity on what we expect our full year overheads will be in 2020 and 2021. We took decisive action in the first half of 2020 to achieve a significant
and sustainable reduction in overheads.

As the Hamriyah yard gears up to deliver 2 large projects through the latter part of the year and into 2021, we do expect overheads to be higher
in the second half of 2020, an increase to an underlying level of $80 million for the full year. This is still a $24 million reduction on 2019, well over
20% year-on-year.

The pie chart on the bottom right of the slide shows the split of our full year 2020 overheads between cash and noncash with $50 million being
the cash element, a reduction of $20 million when compared to 2019. We expect overheads and the cash noncash split to be similar in 2021.

The reorganization and temporary COVID-19 measures have been difficult decisions to make, but have positioned us to deliver on our strategy
and continue on our liquidity pathway, which leads to Slide 15 and our cash position.

In the first half of 2020, our net cash has increased by $28.9 million to $71.4 million. Whilst the contribution from operational cash flow is small, the
significance of a positive swing of $30 million in EBITDA to preserving our liquidity cannot be underestimated.

Securing the 2 jackup rigs from the IMI and converting the rig kits held in inventory to cash was a significant milestone in the first half of the year.
It enabled us to fund the working capital requirements of the Moray East project as it neared its completion in Q3.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Throughout the first half of 2020 and into Q3, we continued to see strong collections of receivables from our customers, supporting our strategy
of working for Tier 1 clients. We had mentioned in May, we have taken steps to minimizing our CapEx in the first half of the year and within other
cash outflows, our settlements at UAE end-of-service maturities.

So on to Slide 16 and in summary. In the first half of 2020, despite the well reported challenges, Lamprell has demonstrated a much improved
financial performance, delivering against our strategic goals and the performance targets we set out in May. This includes securing the IMI rigs and
the $88 million down payment to monetize the rig kits held in inventory, implementing the cost reduction scheme in Q1 and cutting CapEx levels.

As we move through the rest of 2020 and into 2021, we will retain our sharp focus on maintaining liquidity and delivering positive operational
cash flows from our current portfolio of profitable projects. This will also require us to keep our overheads and a tight control. Our balance sheet
remained strong, and we remained debt-free with a solid asset base.

The debt market remains challenging for new business, and we have demonstrated through the facility put in place with HSBC on the Seagreen
project that support is available in the market for credible projects. We continue to explore other opportunities to strengthen the balance sheet
further and support the growth that our strategy is delivering. Our CapEx investments for the rest of 2020 will remain modest and focused on
supporting our renewables business to improve productivity and efficiency. One such investment is into a lifting frame for the offshore wind
foundations that we build in our Hamriyah facility to reduce the need for expensive crane rentals.

In regard to our strategic investments, we remain in discussions to defer any equity contribution to the IMI until the second half of 2021. As I've
already said, our net cash at 30th of June of $71.4 million and we have seen this improve in Q3 to approximately $125 million of net cash at the
end of September.

I do expect projects to draw working capital in Q4. But I am confident that we will finish 2020 with net cash levels similar to those at 30 of June.

So in conclusion, the first half of 2020 has seen Lamprell delivered on its financial targets of positive EBITDA and preservation and enhancement
of our liquidity. We have made strong steps to position the group financially to continue to support our strategic pathway, which is a good time
for me to hand you back to Chris for an update on our strategy. Thank you.

Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
Thanks, Tony. Turning to Page 18 and to our strategic progress. As a reminder, the key pillars of our strategy are outlined on the left-hand side of
the slide, while on the right-hand side are the specific strategic milestones achieved since the beginning of the year.

With respect to strengthening our position in our core markets, namely rigs and offshore wind, we were awarded 2 new build jackup rigs by the
IMI. These are the first 2 jackup rigs awarded to anyone anywhere for many, many years. And as mentioned earlier, we were awarded 30 foundations
for the Seagreen offshore wind project, marking our third successive project solidifying our position in this fast-growing market.

With respect to implementing our EPCI strategy, the majority of our revenues is now attributable to EPCI. This is an important leg in our strategy
as we have moved up the value chain, thereby allowing us to capture more work in revenue than pure fabrication scopes. Meanwhile, we continue
to bid scopes of work on Saudi Aramco's LTA program, which opens up over $3 billion in EPCI opportunities every year and have progressed several
offshore EPC wind opportunities in the renewable space.

With respect to improving our business through innovation and digitization, we have successfully deployed a number of technologies into our
yards, which are already yielding tangible results. Meanwhile, we have made significant progress with respect to developing new revenue streams
from digitization.

Speaking of which, we partnered with Injazat, the region's leading information technology, data and managed service company, wholly owned
by the UAE sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company. Together, we are developing a number of technology-enabled digital ventures,
                                                                                                                                                                             
 the first of which will be focused on asset integrity solutions. In addition, we announced our partnership with Akselos to market and offer digital
twins to our customers.

Moving to renewables on Slide 19, and specifically, the fast-growing offshore wind segment. Globally, offshore wind is expected to quadruple in
the next 5 years and increase by 15x by 2040. It is estimated that nearly 7,000 foundations will be required in the next 5 years globally, of which
half are expected to be jackets. We estimate that the jackets segment of the market alone to be worth $25 billion plus.

Despite COVID, Europe has seen a record commissioning of new capacity this year, and the pace of growth seems to be accelerating, unlike oil and
gas. Furthermore, we are seeing a significant uptick in activity and interest worldwide, including the U.S. market, a topic I will address in more detail
on the next slide.

The U.S. currently has no commercial scale offshore wind capacity, but this is all about to change. In the next 10 years, it's expected that over 22
gigawatts of installed capacity, representing nearly 2,000 foundations will be commissioned up and down the eastern seaboard, as shown on the
graphic on Slide 21 (sic) [Slide 20]. And this is only the beginning. It is estimated that nearly 90 gigawatts of capacity will be installed by 2060. The
opportunity is enormous and believe that our experience and know-how developed over the past 4 years will be a key differentiator. To this end,
we are already engaging with a number of potential customers with the first award decisions expected to begin in 2022.

Moving to oil and gas in Slide 21. Unlike renewables, the oil and gas industry is under extreme stress with the collapse in prices earlier this year.
However, we are well positioned in the Middle East, which is home to the lowest cost reserves anywhere in the world, and therefore, expect that
offshore CapEx spending in both the UAE and Saudi Arabia to continue.

Specifically, ADNOC are in the middle of a previously announced rig acquisition program. We also have a place on Aramco's coveted offshore LTA
program, which is a 6-year framework agreement plus potential options to extend for a further 6 years. The LTA is predominantly work required
to maintain production and therefore, scopes of work continue to be bid and awarded. In fact, we expect a number of award decisions to be made
very soon.

Hydrocarbon fuels will be a significant part of the energy mix for the decades to come, presenting an opportunity for highly skilled and disciplined
contractors with significant local presence, such as ourselves.

Turning to Slide 22. Our digital strategy is integral to our planning, and we are excited about the major opportunities open to us. To this end, we
are progressing innovative digital solutions in our yards that drive improvements across our business. These include successful deployment of
adaptive robotic welding, installation of facial recognition technology within our yards, digitizing our proprietary QA/QC quality management
system and implementing smart nondestructive testing techniques.

These examples are just a sampling of what Lamprell are doing to maintain competitiveness and improve productivity. But our digital strategy
doesn't stop there. We intend to monetize our unique experience and know-how by developing new revenue streams. For example, the energy
industry is highly capital intensive. Therefore, those that can provide differentiated solutions to reduce the cost of those assets as well as make
them more productive over their lifetime will be well positioned going forward.

As mentioned earlier, we partnered with Injazat in 2019 to progress a portfolio of digital ventures, including asset integrity and various other
initiatives to enhance fabrication efficiencies in our core markets with limited investment at this stage. We are piloting these initiatives already in
our yards and have already started to discuss them with a number of clients. Meanwhile, we have further partnered with Akselos, who'll provide
the computational platform for digital twins, which we believe will be a great value to our clients.

Turning to Slide 23 and to outlook. As we navigate the pandemic and current operating environment, we are and continue to be focused on 3
overarching principles. These are maintaining the health and well-being of our employees, protecting our net cash and maintaining liquidity, and
three, progressing our strategic initiatives.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 This laser-like focus has helped us generate cash operationally in the first half. Furthermore, we are on track this year to deliver year-on-year revenue
growth of approximately 24%, with secured revenue for 2020 of $325 million.

For 2021, we already have secured revenue of $400 million, which represents a further growth of 21% as compared to 2020. With respect to the
balance sheet, we are in a net cash position of $71.4 million as at 30 June, a figure which has grown to nearly $125 million as of yesterday, 30
September.

Our bid pipeline is growing with high-quality prospects in both of our end markets of oil and gas and renewables and expect that renewables
portion of the pipeline to show significant growth going forward. Furthermore, we took decisive action earlier this year to reduce our overheads
to significantly reduce our breakeven cash flow level relative to 2019.

Meanwhile, we continue to be confident about our efforts with regards to the LTA and are excited about sharing developments with regards to
our digital aspirations over the coming months. With that, I would like to thank you and open it up for Q&A. Please log your questions via the
webcast, and we will try to answer them as best we can.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thank you, Christopher. (Operator Instructions) And so we do have a question that's coming off -- the first one from Michael Brown at Lombard
Odier. I think this is more for Tony to answer. He asked what cost savings executed in FY '20 are expected to annualize in FY '21?

Antony Wright - Lamprell plc - CFO & Executive Director
And -- thanks. And good morning Michael. Yes, I think obviously, we have got a really, really, really massive focus on overheads this year, and it is
absolutely my belief that the savings that we've crystallized this year will carry forward into 2021. And as I said on my voice over, I expect our cash
overhead to be $50 million in 2020. And I absolutely believe that we will continue that run rate through 2021.

Unidentified Participant
And actually, there's a follow-up from Michael. He just asked if you could just clarify that as of today, you have $400 million of revenue contracted
to be delivered only in FY '21.

Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
That is correct. We expect roughly around $400 million of secured revenue in 2021.

Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thank you. We're just fielding a couple more questions through here. We've got one that's coming from Alex Brooks at Canaccord Genuity.
And can you tell us a little bit more about the strong rise in cash in the end of June? What are some of the moving parts here? And that's probably
more for Tony.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Antony Wright - Lamprell plc - CFO & Executive Director
Yes, if you were -- obviously, the key moving parts were set out in the chart that I put up. I mean clearly, monetizing the rig kits in early Q1 gave us
a real boost in our cash balance. We have to use part of that cash to manage through the working capital requirements of the Moray East project
as they headed towards a conclusion. So clearly, that was helpful.

Really, apart from that, the -- I would say that the major influence on us, maintaining our liquidity pathway has been our ability to swing EBITDA
of $30 million to being positive. And it's a bit of a game changer for us to be able to do that, and it's really supported our cash position very strongly.

Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thank you for the question coming from Daniel Slater at Arden. He's asked, ""Can you tell us a little bit more about the U.S. wind opportunity,
please? I'm assuming it's nothing in the bid pipeline of [segment], but how much might there be bid over the next couple of years? And when is
it realistic to expect some of these U.S. projects that you might bid on being awarded?""

Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
Yes. So I'll take that. Dan, thank you for the question. The U.S. wind opportunity is one of the exciting things about what we're seeing in the offshore
wind market. Currently today, there are no commercial scale offshore wind. U.S. is a big wind producer, but it's all onshore as of now. But there are
now 13 permitted projects that exists in the U.S. And as of June 30, none of those were in the bid pipeline, but what we try to say to date, post
period, over the last few months, we are starting to engage with various opportunities and clients in the U.S. and that was one of the reasons why
the bid pipeline is now well over $6 billion.

These are names that you would -- that we're seeing from Europe. There've been some high-profile oil and gas companies that have bought into
it recently, BP announced a couple of investments in the U.S. We've got Shell. We've got Equinor and some of the traditional offshore wind players
as well. And so there's capital flowing into the segment and into the industry, and the bidding process has started. And some of those will start to
get awarded from 2022 onwards. And we expect that growth to accelerate as we go forward.

Unidentified Participant
Okay. And we've got another question from Alex Brooks at Canaccord. ""My understanding is that Hamriyah is budgeting capacity before the
additional space being brought online, of course (inaudible) what's the additional capacity that this phase brings?""

Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
Yes. That's a difficult one to give you a direct answer on other than to say that it depends on the mix of work. Right now we've got the 2 rigs in
there. We've got Seagreen in there. We're very busy on rig refurbishments and some other smaller opportunities that we're working on in Hamriyah.
So what -- the key thing that we have done this year was to close Sharjah, which was about 20 kilometers away from Hamriyah. So we have
consolidated these efficiencies that we have seen from that consolidation is probably, as I said, about $20 million in the restructuring.

So there's opportunity for us to expand further into Hamriyah, if necessary. And then once work volumes come back, and we're confident that they
will come back, then we -- that will be a time then we'll open back Jebel Ali. But for now under these current circumstances, we're going to continue
to put work into Hamriyah.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Participant
Okay. We've got -- at this stage, I think we don't have any more questions that have come in. So Christopher, if I could just turn it back to you for
any closing remarks.

Christopher McDonald - Lamprell plc - CEO & Executive Director
I would like just to thank everybody, and particularly every -- all the employees who are listening today from Lamprell, fantastic results, keep it up.
And again, thank you, on behalf of myself and the Board, and again, thank you very much. And we look forward to speaking with various stakeholders
in the weeks and months to come.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the Orexo AB audiocast Teleconference. (Operator Instructions) Today, I'm pleased to present Nikolaj Sorensen, CEO. Please
begin your meeting.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Thank you very much, and thank you for all of you who have taken time out of your busy schedule to listen to this presentation. I just heard that
we are approaching 200. So that's a pretty good attendance for Orexo update telephone conference. So the purpose of today's meeting is to give
you an update on how we progress in digital therapies. And I will start on moving to Page #3. And just slightly give us some perspectives on what
we want to accomplish with this meeting. So the first one is, we, of course, want to share the progress on where we stand with our digital therapies.
We're about a month away from our next quarterly call and it's about 3 months ago since we had our last update. So we thought it's a good time
to give a little more flavor on where we stand.

Another thing that we have noticed is that there is a decent interest, and we'll understand the science behind these digital therapies. And we tested
presenting some of the scientific material in a way that we presented to our customers in the U.S., that would say, insurance companies and health
care providers. And the feedback we got here in Sweden from 1 large investor and an analyst was very positive, and we felt, okay, that's probably
something we should do for more people. So everyone have a solid understanding on where we stand. And there, I'm very proud to have Dr. Mike
Sumner to participate on this call, and he will basically present the same material that he does more or less on a daily basis with potential customers
in the U.S.

Then we have also had a couple of news that have come some -- one from Orexo and one from -- directly from the customer. One is for GoGoMeds
and the other one is for Trinity Health in North Dakota. Both of those have created a little, say, noise on the different chat forums. And so what is
this? And why haven't we gone out with that from a corporate perspective? I want to underline that whenever we have an agreement that we find
is material, we will, of course, go out on a corporate basis with the news for any material agreements. The reason why we didn't do it this time is
the first one with GoGoMeds, was together with GoGoMeds we went out with a press release basically to announce the partnership to GoGoMeds
existing customers. So this was a promotional press release stand out from our U.S. subsidiary to announce to those who are today customers of
GoGoMeds that they now have a new product. The agreement with GoGoMeds, Dennis will talk a little more about that. So Dennis Urbaniak who
is also joining me for today's call, our Executive Vice President of Digital Therapeutics, will go a little more into that deal. But the basis for the
agreement is basically a distribution agreement where GoGoMeds has today a pretty broad reach with their own sales force and commercial
activities, and they will now promote Zubsolv, but they are not buying our digital therapies, not for most Zubsolv, but our digital therapies. And
we basically decided this was a promotional news and not material for the company. We did send it out through the financial media in Sweden
also. But as it was in English only, we noticed that it was not picked up by the -- a lot of the Swedish online channels.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The other one is with Trinity Health, and that press releases is actually not from us. It was them. So they asked us that they would like to announce
this partnership or say the -- that they provide access to our products for their own employees. Trinity Health is part of a wider network of Trinity
Health organization in the U.S. and the one that we have an agreement with is Trinity Health in North Dakota and some surrounding areas. Very
important stepping-stone for us to get into the full network of Trinity Health but as such, that agreement is relatively small. But of course, it's a big
sign of confidence in the science behind the products and in the products that they actually want to make it available for their own employees as
a first step.

Then we also have -- today, we will launch the brand name of OXD01. It will be modia. We'll talk a little about that in the presentation. And then
we also have made a lot of advancement in our development of material commercial material for vorvida, in particular. And for those of you who
are following us on video, I hope that -- online you will see a video being played. And for those of you who are following us only through telephone,
you will be able to hear the sound, but of course, not the video, but I will invite you to go into the homepage to see the full video when you have
an opportunity.

So moving to Page #4. As I said before, the 3 speakers today is myself, Nikolaj Sorensen, I'm the CEO of Orexo. Together with me is Mike Sumner,
Dr. Mike Sumner, who's the Chief Medical Officer. Mike is working both with our pharmaceuticals and have done that for several years and also
Dennis Urbaniak who is only focused on digital therapeutics and is leading that effort in the U.S.

I move into Page #6. And here, I just have a very brief introduction to Orexo, for those of you who are new to the company. So we started out as a
specialty pharmaceutical company. Today, we have 4 commercial products that we have developed in terms of pharmaceutical products. We're
doing that from our head -- our site in Uppsala, where we have the head office and also our pharma IND functions. Since 2013, we have our own
commercial infrastructure in the place in the U.S., where we have all of our field force, but also Dr. Mike Sumner, as Chief Medical Officer for the
entire company is located in the U.S., and he is running clinical operations, [sales force] is also ramped out of the U.S. We are a little unique in terms
of being a pharma company in Sweden is that we stand on pretty solid grounds in terms of both revenue, EBITDA and cash position.

So moving to the next page. When we look at the situation in Orexo is that we have converted from being an investment phase in 2012 that was
before the launch of Zubsolv, then it took us 3 years to turn Zubsolv profitable. And since then, Zubsolv has basically been a cash cow for the
company, a both cash cow and growth generator. That amount of money that we've generated from Zubsolv and I recognize a number that's on
the homepage is actually from Q1 and not from Q2. So the number in Q2 was SEK 680 million. The difference is due to the acquisition of deprexis.

When we look at the money that we have in our bank account today, the logic behind that and where we want to invest them is to create future
growth. And what we have done now is that we have acquired the U.S. right to vorvida and deprexis, deprexis most recently. We have initiated a
development of a digital therapy for opioid use disorder. We have invested quite heavily in building up a platform for distribution and reimbursement
for digital therapies. The investments we're doing here are not unique to neither the deprexis or vorvida or our digital therapy for opioid use
disorder. The strategy we have is, of course, to expand and get more products into the same platform. So we are deliberately designing a platform
that should be scalable and be able to support other products in the U.S.

And then finally, we're also advancing our pipeline where we have 1 pharma product that is entering the last phase of development, OX124. So
the cash that we continue to generate from Zubsolv, the cash flow that we have generated during the last 4 years. The strategy for the company
is now to invest some of that cash into the development of the digital therapy area and some of that into finalization of OX124 our new pharmaceutical
product.

Moving to Page #8. This is an overview of our pipeline at the moment, our products and pipeline. You see we have 3 pharmaceutical products that
are all revenue-generating Zubsolv that we promote ourselves in the U.S. It's approved in Europe, and then we hope soon to be able to close a
partnership for Zubsolv distribution in Europe. We have Abstral for breakthrough cancer pain went off-patent in the 2 main markets, U.S. and
Europe and (inaudible) last year, but there's still some income coming from Abstral from other markets. Edluar, we still receive royalties on a global
basis. Then we have OX124, which is quite far the most advanced product and that is now entering into the final development stages. That is
required decent amount of investments right now as we're building up commercial manufacturing of this product. And then we have the focus --
we have a few other pharma products, but in favor of time, I won't go so deep into those now. The focus of today is our digital therapies, and this
is where we are going to explain much more about these products as we progress.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 I just shortly highlight that what we have today is deprexis and vorvida where Orexo has the U.S. rights for these products. Our partner, GAIA, have
other partners for deprexis in other markets. And for vorvida, they are promoting that themselves in Germany. For modia, we have the global rights.
Our focus right now is on the U.S., but Orexo has the global rights to modia, so we can decide where and how to promote that product when it is
finally developed.

Then I'm moving into Page #10. And this is a little -- so just to the -- what is the background for Orexo to decide to move into digital therapies.
Some of you have probably heard me talking about this before, but for those who are new to the company, I'd say the logic that we have is actually
twofold. One is that we have an established infrastructure inside into the C space in the U.S. where we see a significant need for improved psychosocial
support. We see that the majority of the patients who today receive Zubsolv and any other buprenorphine-naloxone products in the U.S. do not
receive adequate psychosocial support, which is in all recommendations, the pharmaceutical is one leg of the treatment, but it's as important to
work with the mind and the behavior of the patients. When we see that, we have seen -- is there a way that we could solve this and drive it in the
-- with the same thinking that we had around pharmaceuticals, where we could basically build a scalable business where we could add on additional
patients without a significant amount of cost.

And that's why we come into detailed therapies because when you look at the advancement in digital interactions, we see that the digital therapies
have an ability and a potential to replace a lot of the interaction that today require human interaction in the health care system. And for me, that
appears to be a way that we could solve some of the issues that we have in the health care system on a global basis where we lack access to health
care providers, to physicians, to psychologist, psychotherapies and similar, where we can basically complement the existing infrastructure and
replacing some of those resources with a digital solution. It's a way to vastly improve the efficiency in the health care system. I'm absolutely convinced
this is going to happen, but I also recognize that we are in some early stages. So logic for us is basically this place where we act with our current
products, we see a significant need. We have found a solution, digital therapies, and we believe that this long-term is going to be a fantastic growth
opportunity for the company.

Moving to Page #11. The other areas is, so why are we now moving into alcohol addiction and into mental illness like depression. And then when
you look at the comorbidity or cooccurrence of mental illness with any kind of addiction, it's a significant cooccurrence. It's up to 50% of those with
suffering from drug addiction also reports some kind of mental health issue. So it's very simple that we go from where we stand. Opioid addiction,
we see a lot of mental health issues for those patients. We expand into that space. We see a lot of cross substance misuse where opioid addicts or
alcohol addicts are also using the other substance. It's quite logical to move into alcohol addiction. So it vastly became very natural to go into these
other disease areas, apart from opioid use disorder.

Moving to Page #12. So what is it that we want to accomplish? Today, we have the right to 3 products, all developed by GAIA, German company,
probably the world leader in these digital therapies. When we look at the U.S. market, we're seeing that one of the main issues for these products
and for the rollout of digital therapies is the ability to establish a platform for reimbursement for distribution of the products that's integrated into
the health care system in the U.S. We have decided to invest a sizable amount of money and resources into building such a platform, and we are
now discussing, of course, with payers and health care providers, how we can smoothen out the process to ensure that patients who need access
to these tools can find a smooth way to do it, where they can get reimbursed by the health care -- by their health insurance or by the health care
provider.

So we are certain that when we've solve this issue, we have an ability to expand into new products. And what are we doing to position ourselves
there? We have a partnership together someone called Lyfebulb. Where we have an innovation challenge, where we have the final is coming up
just in a few weeks. You can read more about that on our homepage. It's a way for us to create presence and get insight into a lot of the entrepreneurs
that you see in digital therapies that you won't really see in pharmaceuticals because the cost of developing a pharmaceutical is so high. But when
you get to digital therapies and you have an ability to start from a much smaller scale. And in those smaller scales, and in particular, when the -- a
lot of them come out of the health care sector, we believe there could be opportunities for Orexo to play a more active role and here, Lyfebulb
challenge is one way for us to get a good insight into what is going on. And again, I'm proud to see both the amount of interest from companies
and also pretty -- a very strong jury that we have been able to attract to participate into this.

And then we, of course, we are participating where digital health are moving, there's something in U.S. call Digital Therapeutic Alliance. Orexo is
a member of that together with several other companies because we really believe that this sector deserves a role in the health care sector -- in

                                                                                                                                                                             
 the health care system, and we want to play an active role in this. So we are -- right now, the strategy for us is to build this platform starting with
the products we have today. But we're not done with these 3 products. We are going to expand into more new disease areas when we get
confirmation that our reimbursement and distribution system works.

On Page #13, the next page. We have an overview of our 3 products, and you will hear much more details about those by Mike, in particular, and
a little from Dennis later. So I won't go too much into the details behind them. But as you can see here, we see them to have a pretty sizable sales
potential. And if you want to get a little more data behind those estimates, and we presented that at our Capital Markets Day in March this year,
so you can access that on our homepage. And you will see we have taken, we believe, a relatively conservative estimates in terms of what we can
reach in terms of patients and the market share we can get in the market. And with just a little market share we can actually get to a pretty high
number because the number of people who are affected from depression, from alcohol issues and from opioid issues is significant. Then said that,
that we have a significant potential. I also feel it's my duty to say that we also recognize that this is in a very early stage. There are a lot of hurdles
that we and other players in this sector needs to address to ensure that this market really takes off. We see that commercialization and this how
do we scale it, how do we get the commercialization out to more than just a few customers is something that start to loosen up, but it's not really
there. There are a few companies like Livongo, who was just acquired a few months -- a few weeks ago, for $18.5 billion, I believe. Livongo, I think,
is one of those companies who have succeeded to find a route to commercialize on a broader scale. And we, of course, find that they're paving the
way for others like Orexo. Pricing is an area. It's -- as I said, it's quite easy to enter this space. But how do you really differentiate and show those
companies who have invested a lot in development and creating clinical evidence that those products are actually better. And this is a dialogue,
you, of course, need to have with all the insurance companies who get calls from a lot of different entrepreneurs who often come with just a concept
and some powerpoints. What's the difference between these products that we come with and those who are much lighter and you can download
from App Store for maybe $10 or $20. Here, I think there's an educational efforts that we need to put behind. But I think, again, the evidence we
have from the dialogue with payers is that they do recognize there is a quality difference.

Reimbursement is another area. Of course, when a patient want the product. Since a few days back, we now make it possible for patients to pay
online directly for purchasing vorvida but the optimal way and for this market to really take off, we want the health insurance to cover this. We see
there is a great interest. There is a great understanding about the medical need for these products but we also recognize that for a lot of the health
insurance companies, there's no established reimbursement process, no established review process for these products. And this is something we
need to work with. And this comes out of this being a disruptive technology that while it has been proven clinically, there are still a -- it's coming
in as a completely new treatment tool in the box for the health care sector in the U.S. and other countries. All of these hurdles is something that
we can overcome. There are so many other companies who are working on the same in a very serious manner, in particular, through the Digital
Health Alliance in the U.S., and we can see that the way we're received from health care insurance companies, from providers, this is clearly top of
mind. One of the largest national in health insurance companies in the U.S., we have set up a meeting with them later in the autumn. And why
haven't we done it yet? Because they have just recruited a person who's going to sit up in the top management of this organization with a full
responsibility for digital therapies. That just happened right now. And that's kind of showing where we are. One of the largest insurance companies
in the U.S. have just decided to appoint one person who has a full responsibility to implement digital health solutions into that insurance company.
So we are working in parallel with a lot of the payers.

So with that said, I gave you a little introduction to why do we have this telephone conference and also to this strategy behind Orexo and digital
therapies. But I guess the main interest for a lot of you should be listening to Dr. Mike Sumner presenting clinical data behind deprexis and vorvida.
Mike, the floor is yours.

Michael Sumner - Orexo AB (publ) - Chief Medical Officer
Thank you, Nikolaj, and good morning, good afternoon to the people on the call today. If we could move to the Burden of Depression slide, please.
So I'm sure to many on this call, burden of depression is well recognized. In 2017, there were actually 7.1% of the U.S. population who had a major
depressive episode defined as a period of 2 weeks or more having significant symptoms. That is actually also with over half of those classified as
actually having severe impairments along with those symptoms. And unfortunately, that data is obviously pre-COVID, and we know that there has
been a significant increase in depression and also that will relate to vorvida problematic drinking later on. In transitioning to the next slide, that
burden generated 200 million prescriptions. But as you will see on the slide, that actually only represents 50% of the population. And there is
                                                                                                                                                                             
 actually 35% of that population who are untreated. And there is a recognized relationship between the lack of treatment and worse outcomes
down the line. So that's a significant shortfall in the management of these patients.

Moving on to the overview of deprexis slide. Just like if you are a look and feel of what deprexis looks like and actually also applies to the other
products. All 3 of the products that I'm going to discuss today are based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. And they include the patented
artificial intelligence aspects that is being developed by our partner, GAIA, which allows for the customized nature of both the content of the
patient receives and also the nature that they receive that. And as you can see on this slide, embedded in the program are audio recordings, text,
which can be delivered in different lengths, if you like, a short description or a more lengthy clinical description that's inside the program and there
are animations and illustrations and videos, which just make it more engaging for the patient.

So if you took 2 people going through deprexis who had different background, means, their journey through deprexis could be entirely different.
And that is, in some ways, as you would imagine, very similar to how therapists could interact with their patient and change how they deliver their
therapy. So moving on to the next slide. What is actually obviously more important, though, is what's the actual clinical effect of your product. Our
partner GAIA has done an excellent job supporting research, and it is actually quite a challenge to get through the -- all the different clinical studies
with deprexis in the time we're allocated sometimes. So -- but I -- just to highlight some of those today. They have studied deprexis in multiple
clinical situations. And one of the main studies, the U.S. study by Professor Beevers out of the University of Texas, was actually in a clinical setting
with very minimal interaction from the clinicians overseeing the clinical trial. So in some ways, akin to a patient going in to see their family practitioner
and receiving deprexis without much wraparound services. And I'll show you the clinical benefit from that study. But they've also looked at it
integrated into face-to-face therapy. And what was actually interested -- interesting in that study was -- it was a 12-week study. And in that 6-week
time point, they looked at what the relationship was between the patient going through the therapy and the therapist. And if deprexis wasn't in
that included in their treatment program. The working alliance between those 2 actually predicted the outcome, which I think is fairly constant.
However, once you integrate deprexis into the face-to-face therapy, it didn't matter as much of what that relationship was, it wasn't able to predict
whether there was a successful clinical outcome.

And they've also used deprexis in specific to these states -- many disease states are associated with significant depression. And so they've looked
at multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and that's gambling addiction as well. So moving on to the next slide.

So what is nice about all those studies is that they -- every single one of them showed a positive clinical impact for deprexis. And this leads into the
concept of effect size. What effect size really means is it's the kind that a patient can actually notice an improvement from an intervention. And in
depression, that is given a score of 0.2 and if you look at sort of depression research in the whole, people start getting excited around a clinical
effect size of 0.3 as a meaningful -- as the intervention has proved a meaningful output. But when you put all the deprexis studies together, you
actually see a clinical effect size of 0.51. And so we're seeing a significant clinical impact across the deprexis studies.

So moving to the next slide. This is the U.S. study that I said by Professor Beevers. It recruited 376 patients, there was a 3:1 randomization. So actually
just 8 weeks of deprexis. So we allow access for 12 weeks in United States. So that gives the patient, obviously, more time to access the exercises
in the program. But the 8-week study also shows in some ways, how quickly a patient can get a clinical improvement in their symptoms. The patients
were required to have a moderate level of depression. And if they were receiving other treatments, they had to be stable for 30 days. And you were
excluded if you had a suicidal risk or another major psychological diagnosis.

So moving to the next slide. The primary endpoint used to be quick inventory of depression symptoms. This is a scale from 0 to 27. And as you'll
see on the slide, patients had a score of around 15 to 16 on average. And this actually put them at the upper end of the moderate depression range.
And you can see from following the interventions there was some improvement in the care as usual, but there was a significant improvement in
the patients that received deprexis. And that the effect size, as you mentioned from the previous slide, I said there was an average of 0.5. But in
this study, it was actually an effect size of 0.8, which was a very large clinical effect size. And patients actually had a 12x greater chance of receiving
a 50% reduction in their depression symptoms. So that was very nice to see. But also it's not just the depression symptoms, depression affects all
aspects of their life or many other aspects of their life. And there was also a significant impact on the disability. They use the Sheehan Disability
Scale. And so these patients were not only seeing an improvement in their depression symptoms, but it was also translating into other elements
of their life.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So the next slide, this is actually from the first German study performed. It's, in some ways, a very similar design to the Beever study. So I'm not
going to go into detail there. But what I used this slide to demonstrate is that you could -- these patients actually had a 6-month follow-up. And
obviously, one of the questions that we received is, is there a sustained clinical effect after the use of the product? And when you actually think of
what CBT does, I mean, it actually changes the way you think about issues. And I think one of the sort of simple example is actually a sort of vorvida
example. If you walk into a bar and you have a single drink and then your thought process goes to, oh, well, I've had a single drink. Now I can -- I
might as well just finish the night and drink how I used to. That clearly isn't a good thinking process. It will be much better to train yourself to think
I've had a single drink. I enjoyed that. Now I can go home or whatever. So the fact that CBT helps you with your cognitive restructuring goes to the
point that you would expect to see sustained clinical effect with these products.

So with that, I am going to transition into vorvida and problematic drinking. So if we can move to that slide. So problematic drinking isn't something
that is often talked about. But when you actually look at the statistics, it actually is -- has a very similar impact to depression with 16.6 million people
binge drinking greater than 5x in the month, in the United States. And as you can imagine, this has significant impact in both short and long-term
disease conditions and has a very significant economic burden, which is actually largely related to binge drinking.

So if we move to the overview of vorvida slide. Vorvida, again, has a similar look and feel to deprexis organized in sort of 4 modules, but there is a
lot of content into those 4 modules that the patient can access over 6 months. And it takes the individual through recognizing their drinking
behavior, setting the goals that the patient would like to achieve. And then it gives them exercises to integrate into their daily life. And then also
has a module that plans for after vorvida so that they can take those behaviors and successfully transition them into their day-to-day life.

If we can move to the next slide, please. So vorvida has a single study, but a very well-designed and significant study. It was conducted in Germany.
There were 608 patients who were equally randomized to vorvida or care as usual. The inclusion criteria were basically you had to be drinking more
than what was the normal recognized safe level of drinking. So at that time, that was 1 drink a day on average for a female and 2 for male. And
obviously, in the United States, those recommendations have actually just been reduced to one drink for all. However, the patients, as you'll see
in the study, were drinking considerably more than that when they entered the trial. And 1 question I have got is this was a German study, the
drinking laws are different in Germany to the U.S., so how does it translate to the United States population? And when you actually look at the age
of first drinking and also the time that they started drinking regularly, they are very similar to the U.S. population with an age of around 15 for their
first drink and starting to drink regularly at around 17.5 which probably isn't that different for a lot of American children going off to college.

So if we can move to the next slide, please. So this is just a brief look at what they measured in the study. They used the Quantity-Frequency-Index,
which is a self-report for the past 30 days of drinking and the timeline follow back, which is a report of the past 7 days. These are well recognized
ways of reporting alcohol intake in clinical trials. But what I think is an easier concept to grasp, but for people to buy into is, everyone can recognize
binge drinking as greater than 5 drinks per day on a single occasion. And obviously, the elements of drunkenness, and I'll present data on those in
a couple of slides.

So if we can move to the next slide, please. So vorvida was associated with a significant reduction, as you would hope in this trial as measures both
the QFI and the TFB. And there was also an impact on the care as usual, which you might expect as these patients were seeking help with their
drinking behavior. So it was -- it's nice to see also that the patients can impact their drinking without vorvida. But what they weren't able to change
their drinking behavior as we move to the next slide was when you look at the binge drinking and drunkenness parameters. So for binge drinking,
they started off in the clinical trial drinking -- binge drinking every other day and by the end of the 6-month time period, they were roughly down
to only being able to binge drink on average once per week. And drunkenness also went from 4.4 days at the start to 1.5 days on average at the
end of the 6-month period. And as you can also say, there was no real impact in the care as usual. So vorvida was doing something very different
than just the self-motivation of trying to reduce your drinking.

So then on to my last slide on modia. This is the product that is still in development, but certainly in the final stages. As you heard Nikolaj mentioned,
there is a significant lack of access to psychosocial support for patients with opioid use disorder. Looking at the data there out of 93% -- out of --
looking at the health care providers, 93% of them reported that most MAT patients would benefit from counseling, but only 36% of them reported
an adequate number of counselors in that area. And when you actually look at patients who were starting buprenorphine therapy, 41% of those
reported they didn't have access to counseling at all in their first 30 days of treatment. And when I think back to the Zubsolv data, you see considerable
drop out of those patients in the first few weeks of treatment. So getting that access to behavioral therapy as well, we think could have a significant

                                                                                                                                                                             
 impact on treatment outcomes. Modia is going to be available to patients for 6 months. It's going to be structured into 24 exercises, and we will
be bringing this product to market in quarter 4 under the recent enforcing policy for digital health devices during the COVID emergency, and we
will be planning a very robust data gathering exit -- exercises around modia to ensure that we can demonstrate the efficacy and safety going
forward. And so with that, I would like to hand over to my colleague, Dennis.

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
Thanks, Mike, I appreciate that. And if we could go to Slide 31, I'm very happy to introduce formally the modia name and logo. We're incredibly
proud of this product at GAIA and at Orexo and we think this does represent a new modern-day for patients with opioid use disorder. We're also
proud of how we've got the patient insights along the way. I'll point out the smaller the speech bubble in the A that's representative of individuals
in recovery, the insight is there a lot of moments, which to -- people that have an experience recovery may not seem like a big deal, but those
individual moments really matter and their progress in milestones to recovery that we know modia is going to be a key part of. And so we brought
that directly into the branding and to the logo and you can see the color design. And so this will be our formal reference for modia as we go forward.
Obviously, we're excited to turn what Mike just described into reality for so many that need it.

Moving to Slide 33. As we talk about our digital therapeutics portfolio across the board, we get a lot of questions around what are these therapies?
Help me understand them a little bit more. And when you have 3 or 6-month therapies, it's not always easy to demonstrate that, but I'm really
excited to share what we call a trailer video in the concept of a movie trailer. And so I am going to press play now so you can see the trailer video.

(presentation)

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
So we'll move to Slide 34, please. So you've seen from Mike a lot of clinical elements and some of the important aspects. But hopefully, that trailer
it shows you some of the common features of our therapies and why we're so excited to bring these forward with the evidence that they deliver,
they're all based on CBT, as you saw, they are supported by peer-reviewed clinical evidence and that's so important to demonstrate the true impact
that's been tested of these therapies. Also this evidence has been done in pragmatic trials, so they're translatable into real-world situations. But
the other thing that we love about them is that patients can access them in the privacy of their own home. They are incredibly simple from a user
experience point of view, nothing to download. You just need a connected browser on any type of device and you're ready to go. And the patient
can set the pace and adapt it to their own situation. And for areas like problematic drinking, for example, this is highly relevant to the needs that
are out there. And as Mike mentioned, the power of our platform is we can individualize the therapy, mimicking those actions that the best therapists
would take in a counselling session so that you have a highly relevant experience, and we know that, that translates into outcomes.

And so if we could move to Slide 35, I'd like to just share, since we talked in July and mentioned our launch, we've made great progress, and I'm
incredibly proud of the efforts the teams put forward. What we're seeing from the market in our initial discussions, the medical need and the
treatment value here is recognized for both deprexis and for vorvida. Our customers are dealing with these issues, they understand the challenges
and they're clear on the unmet need, and that's incredibly positive.

We're advancing dialogues with -- we mentioned in July that we're targeting commercial insurers, integrated delivery networks and other types
of distributors and employers. And I'm very happy to say that despite the challenges of the pandemic in terms of normal call patterns and conversation
patterns, a lot of conversations are moving quite significantly with key partners on the access front. And obviously, that's an important development
that we'll keep everyone posted on. And of course, this past weekend, on the 25th, we had another major milestone with our full vorvida experience
and this represents a little bit of what Nikolaj mentioned earlier, how we're building a comprehensive service-based platform for all of our digital
therapies, Vorvida being first out of the gate, that makes the process simple that helps people understand the reimbursement landscape and also
for those individuals that want to purchase the products directly for the discrete nature, for example, with vorvida and problematic drinking, we
can make that happen. Another great milestone is with our partners at GAIA, we've completed technical development on modia and are now
moving forward on the testing.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So terrific progress in a short period of time. Of course, we still have more to do. And we're very focused now on navigating the landscape that
Nikolaj described earlier, reimbursement, while the medical unmet need is clearly recognized, individual customers and payers don't necessarily
have established pathways. Not only for access but for administration. And so we're working now on creating that together with those partners.
We're moving to demand generation. So we will have initial media, targeted media efforts for vorvida as well as we're very excited to unlock the
power of our terrific sales organization in the U.S. to educate physicians, and that's all starting beginning in October, which is today.

Finally, the deprexis updates, you'll see a little bit later in Q4 following some of those features that we have with vorvida. And then with modia,
we'll move into a testing phase, both from a technical and clinical point of view, which will set us up for a broader commercial launch in the second
half of 2021.

So with that, if we you could go to Slide 36, just want to emphasize, we shared this information with you in July on where our launch focus was.
And we're looking at a payer approaches that follow traditional pharmaceutical models, also a lot of framework based agreements, which are
different types of agreements, whether it be value-based, et cetera, and patient direct models. And so we're continuing our focus on the top 2
obviously, the patient model for vorvida is out and ready to go. And what we're seeing in these payer discussions is the models are definitely
evolving. And I think the benefit, they like the fact that we're open to the framework agreements. That offers the flexibility to find a way to make
these fit, aligned to how care is being provided and delivered and paid for. And that flexibility, I think, shows a strong partnering opportunity when
you line that up with the unmet need, we're very optimistic about the progress we'll make with access.

And a good example of that, if you could move to Slide 37 is the 2 deals, the 2 very recent partnerships that we have announced. So GoGoMeds
on the left. This is very unique because this is an organization that's quite innovative that's leveraging an infrastructure in place where they work
with states and different types of customers, both private and public, but this is an organization that has a very strong understanding capability
around behavioral therapies. And so the fit here with deprexis and vorvida was perfect. Our initial focus with GoGoMeds is looking at courts and
surrounding systems. So probationary and attorney based approaches with vorvida. And from there, we will move to expand to deprexis, particularly
with some of their employer-based customers. And I have to say, we just kicked this partnership off. We have been very impressed by the response
we've seen from some of the judges we've been speaking to in our initial target states and so more to come there, but a terrific progress.

And then equally, on the right-hand side, Nikolaj referenced Trinity and Trinity in North Dakota for those of you that might be tracking the continued
progress of COVID in the U.S. Unfortunately, this region of the U.S. right now is experiencing a lot of the frontline surge that the East and others
saw earlier and Trinity serves North Dakota, Montana, a very large catchment area, I think a very innovative decision by Trinity management to
make these therapies available to their frontline workers. They have a very sizable employee base. A large population that they're serving. And
equally, we have seen, in a very short period of time, the uptake in terms of utilization and questions and positive response in the therapies has
been quite significant. So early signs, early steps forward, but very positive around the patient experience.

Moving from there, I'll just remind you on Slide 38. Where we are in our commercialization approach. And as we've talked about -- as we've done
these updates for you, we are taking a highly targeted approach to market, creating access. So we're still in Phase III of access creation and then
we're starting to move to customer engagement and value creation. We'll do that quite carefully, meaning we'll target our commercial efforts as
access is created, so that not only our investment's appropriately placed but more importantly, that, that experience for both the physicians, the
payers and the patients is aligned and is positive along the way. That's a key learning we've had as a heavy focus on patient experience.

I think a great example of that is on Slide 39. We, in July, announced to you on the left, our day 1 site for deprexis, for example, which is up today.
We announced some of the vorvida marketing materials, which is the picture you see of our campaign in the middle and what's new and what
we're extremely excited about on the right-hand side is a snapshot here of the full vorvida platform, where you can learn about the product, there's
information for patients, for health care providers. And the full customer service and hub services, which help with things like reimbursement
questions as well as any product questions. And I think another thing, I'm very proud that the team has been able to do is align with that we've
started conversations on both Instagram and Facebook to educate individuals about vorvida, where it fits and how to learn more. So very nicely
aligned social approach to support the product. Again, it demonstrates that anchor on experience.

And if we could move to Slide 40, the other thing we're very proud of is along the way, whether it be development or as we now go to
commercialization, our involvement and focus on patients and patient needs and patient engagement has been a top priority for everyone at the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 company. And now you can go to our Orexo homepage and read our blog, and we've had the great opportunity and benefit, frankly, where
individuals have agreed to share their own personal stories through recovery, through mental health, all the aligned areas. And so this is just a
snapshot of some of the amazing people we've got to know along the way who are providing incredibly valuable insights to us. And I'm proud not
only that we're highlighting these very important stories, which are specific and give you real tangible examples. But on the next slide on Slide 41,
we're also taking those insights and we're embedding that into everything we do to serve the market. And so it's recognizing their stories, but it's
also providing them the tools and the access.

And what you see on this slide is just a couple of examples of the way that we put together supporting tools, either directly from the website or
through other channels to make the experience of learning about our products, in this case, these are vorvida examples, as well as acquiring them
and then using them along the way as simple and as clear as possible. And we've seen across the board, that's a need that individuals have
communicated on both the health care professional and the patient side, and so we're embedding those insights into our services. And as Nikolaj
mentioned, that's the rationale for that investment on patient services and platform services that are serving vorvida today, we'll start to serve
deprexis quite shortly and we'll become a core component of the experience we deliver for all of our assets going forward.

So in summary, we've had tremendous progress in the commercialization front, we're very encouraged by the early response that we've seen from
the marketplace. And obviously, we have a lot in front of us that we're continuing to push forward and drive with digital therapy, and we'll look
forward to continued updates on commercialization as we go.

So with that, I'll turn it back to Nikolaj for some closing comments and the Q&A.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Thank you very much, Dennis, and to Mike, for a -- for 2 very good presentations. I am a salesman, and I can't help telling you, if some of you have
a U.S. credit card, I invite you and you think you have a need for vorvida, I can invite you to go into our homepage and you can buy a full subscription
of vorvida for $750 for a 6-month treatment period. So that is available right now.

So moving to page number 43. So why should Orexo be an interesting value story for you? We believe that when we look at our pipeline, we look
at the need, and in particular, the need that it's emerging in the world right now as a result of the pandemic, we are placed in a very large and
definitely growing market. We are moving into digital therapies, which we are absolutely certain, is going to be an integrated part of health care
delivery when we look x number of years ahead. The only thing that I'm not certain about is the pace, but that we intend to 15 years that all of us,
whenever we access health care, will have a digital health element into that interaction. I'm absolutely certain about.

Orexo is there right now, when this market takes off, just like I said, there are several of these large insurance companies who right now are recruiting
people to lead their own efforts into this space.

Moving to page number 44. So one of the things that makes us unique compared to a lot of the other companies is we do have Zubsolv. Zubsolv
is profitable. We had a more than 50% EBIT margin in the last quarter of Zubsolv. It's going to generate cash that we can now invest into both the
digital therapies and into our pharma pipeline. And it will continue to do that for the next many years. This is enabling us basically to take this cash
and now invest into the future growth of the company, which I think differentiate us from a lot of the other digital therapy companies who are
more focused on this space and basically don't have that solid ground to lay on as we have from an Orexo part.

The other unique thing that we have, and I think this is differentiating us, in particular, again, for companies who are coming from the [tax] horizon
is, we do have an established U.S. commercial infrastructure that is meeting hundreds of physicians every single day, all relevant for modia in
particular. But as you're seeing with the comorbidities and co-occurrence of alcohol addiction and depression. Of course, they are very relevant
for that group also. And as we progress, and we will, of course, expand our sales presence into the other disease spaces as well using digital therapies
as a stepping ground.

And finally, we have a pipeline that even on the pharma side, is expanding and targeting some very unique needs, and I'm very sorry to see that
the number of people who are affected from alcohol addiction, but maybe even more serious on opioid addiction has basically accelerated

                                                                                                                                                                             
 throughout the COVID-19 period. In some of the states where we have seen a lockdown, we've seen the number of people dying from opioid at
the overdose has grown with more than 10% compared to the same month last year. So when being in this space, I'm sure we are in a position as
a company where we, unfortunately, are in the aftermath of the pandemic, Orexo is very well positioned to play an important role.

And with that, I will stop the formal presentation and open up for any questions. I apologize that we're getting close to the hour, but we will stay
on as long as there are questions to be answered.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Samir Devani from Rx Securities.

Samir Devani - Rx Securities Limited, Research Division - Research Analyst
I've just got a couple, I guess, Nikolaj, you've talked about some challenges in terms of reimbursement. I guess, since over the last few months and
since we last spoke to you, perhaps you can just outline the sort of the -- a bit more granularity what those challenges are? What are payers asking
from you? And then secondly, just -- one of your slides, you're talking about going out to physicians this month. But is that premature if the
reimbursement isn't in place?

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
So on the reimbursement. So what payers are asking us for is if you look at the distribution channels you have today, you have the pharmaceutical
distribution channel, it's very well established. The payer process -- the payment process are going through the pharmacies to the wholesalers
who will then pay to the pharmaceutical companies. That required that you have a prescription and goes into the pharmacies, the prescriptions
in the U.S. for pharmaceuticals is very well established with a certain code. And there, we know some of our colleagues in the industry are working
a lot with what they call prescription PTX. But the process is still not there. So it's everything from upgrading the IT systems to be able to reflect
the -- are these new products, which are often based on an FDA approval with a certain number, a unique number for the products. So that is not
there. The other alternative you have is medical benefits. And that's basically when you have a physician who is sending in a bill to the insurance
companies. And then they will ask for getting reimbursed for whatever hours and other services that they have provided. Here, we are a little in
the middle. We are providing what is much more like a medical service but we're providing in a way which is much -- which is more similar to the
pharmaceutical therapy. And I think that is kind of the clash, where do we belong? Are we Unipharma product? Or are you a medical benefit? And
how do we integrate that reimbursement process into the existing system and processes?

And the same goes, you can say, for the review of pricing and benefit of the products when you get to pharmaceuticals, it's a very well-established
process. All of the insurance companies have forms that we need to fill in. They have what they call P&T committees often. But there's no such
things for digital therapies. And I think this is where you end up is when we are talking to a lot of the insurance companies from the medical
perspective, they're really positive about this. I think we can say that unanimously across the companies we have talked to, they like the idea, they
get the medical benefit. The question they come back is, but now we need to find a way, how do we put this into our systems? And here, I actually
think there's a difference. There's not 1 answer to your question, it is different. But I think the problem is this kind of we are an -- in the middle
between a pharma and a medical benefit. But at the same time, there's a huge interest in solving it. But I think this is something that is taking time,
but it's very positive now to see several of the large insurance companies are actually hiring people to take care of this. So we are able to work
along with them.

And then with regards to the field force. So the opportunity we have right now is, of course, that our field force is already out there. The main
targeting for the field force will be the existing physicians who are working with Zubsolv. It will basically be for those who are also seeing alcohol
-- patients who are suffering from alcohol addiction. And if you compare the alternative for a lot of these patients is to go to a rehab center, it is to

                                                                                                                                                                             
 pay for their own counselor and when you look at the price of that, even $750 that we're charging is quite attractive for these patients. So for
patients who do have an issue with alcohol addiction and for the physicians where we meet there is now an opportunity for them to purchase
access to the product. So this is more direct to patient. It's basically paying out of pocket. At the same time, we are working with a lot of the -- with
more and more physicians to put pressure on the insurance companies to reimburse it. So you're kind of working from 2 ends. One is from our
market access team meeting the insurance companies asking them or trying to -- asking them to reimburse the product. And at the same time,
creating a demand from physicians who are going to the insurance company and say, we want you to reimburse this product. So it is kind of from
2 edges. But right now, the main focus is on existing targets, so to say, the price for us to go out with our field force is not that high because we
have a significant synergy with the established organization. So I don't know, Dennis, if you have anything to add to this.

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
Yes. I think that addresses it. I think there's kind of 4 phases, there's awareness of DTx, what are they and how do they work? There's the medical
evidence generation. Then there is how do we create access? And finally, the logistics of how do we administer it? Which are the practical ways to
get things paid for. So we're kind of moving through each of those phases, as Nikolaj described. And with each payer right now, they're unique
and individual. So it's a matter of connecting within each of those steps. But the evidence we have gives us tremendous momentum to do that.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Okay. Any other questions?

Samir Devani - Rx Securities Limited, Research Division - Research Analyst
That's great.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Klas Pyk from Nordea.

Klas Pyk - Nordea Markets, Research Division - Research Analyst
Two, if I may. So first, thank you for elaborating on the challenges ahead in the previous questions, but could you please be a bit more concrete
about your expectations on the timeline ahead? What is a reasonable expectations for getting, for example, vorvida reimbursed? And second, in
the out-of-pocket segment, even though vorvida has only been available for around a week, can you give any indication on the very early uptake
of new users?

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
So on your first question, that's, of course, it's a difficult one. There's a lot of discussions going on with both regional and national insurance
companies. If we take just from the response we have from the medical part, we would believe it's something that is going quite fast, but then
some of these organizations are very large. But we do anticipate to see reimbursement building over the next quarter. But as we've said all the
time, we believe the real acceleration in sales is going to come next year, but we do believe there will be reimbursement during this quarter. But
to be very -- I can't be more specific than that because you can say we have some very positive discussions with large national players. But at the
same time, we're also seeing that it's difficult for them even to get together their team partly because of COVID-19, which is delaying that a little.
But we do believe that we see some reimbursement come during the first -- this fourth quarter, but consistent with our previous message, we
believe the real buildup is coming next year.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Then around uptake for our for homepage. So first, I say the homepage is live, but the promotion of the homepage is starting now. So whatever --
whoever is coming into the homepage is more by accident and actually more through some investor relations like impact and then maybe some
of my friends on LinkedIn have found out because I published the link at LinkedIn. So it's -- we have not gone out wide this. So our expectations
to sales this first week is not high. And at the same time, I will also say, we will not comment on the sales as we're just closing our third quarter, and
we have our Q3 report coming in about a month's time. So I can't comment more specific on that.

Any other questions?

Operator
As there are no further questions, I will hand it back to the speakers for closing comments.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Thank you. We have received a couple of questions through the Internet. So there's a question here. So in the vorvida [ICTs], where the self-reports
of drinking cooperated by significant others. So were there any significant others involved in the self-reporting? It's maybe to you, Mike if you know
that vorvida?

Michael Sumner - Orexo AB (publ) - Chief Medical Officer
No, that was not part of the study design.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Then I received a question says, I wonder how long time it will take before you have reached a reimbursement solution with insurance companies?
And my response here is, again, I believe that we'll see some of the first reimbursement coming through this quarter, and we will then expect to
build up during next year.

We have another one. Here's the civil one to U.S. market intention. The U.S. market in regards to patients treated with antidepressant somewhat
40 million to 50 million patients on a yearly basis. Of course, the addressable market for deprexis is a smaller portion of the total number of patients.
How large do you assume the addressable market is?

I believe the number we are looking at, Dennis, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what we have identified is about 15 million to 20 million
patients. Dennis do you have a more exact number?

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
That's correct. There's in terms of the mild to moderate to severe and experiencing depressive episodes, 20 million would be the full base and
about 10 million of that are those that are undergoing some type of treatment today. And in both categories, deprexis is an option as an adjunct
approach.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Then I have a question is how large is the accessible part of the addressable market? So how many of these patients, 10 million to 20 million are
accessible?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I think this is really about reimbursement. So this is how fast we get reimbursement. And I do think that the main focus for us are commercial
reimbursement. So the ones who are on Medicaid, and I don't know exactly how that looks like for depression is definitely coming late or much
later than the portion who have commercial insurance. And for most spaces, I believe that it's about a little more dominance on commercial
insurance and Medicaid. So to make it easy, maybe half of this is commercial.

Then I have a question, I like here, as Orexo's assumption predictions for future sales potential of deprexis, $150 million to $225 million in light of
the number of patients seem low as that is only 225,000 patients annually. I must admit, I haven't done the math behind this. So -- but the question
is, why are your ambitions predictions forecast so or low?

I like that at the same time, also recognizing, and I know that from previously that if I go out with a much higher number than a lot of you will come
and tell me, why didn't you get to that number. So this time, we have decided to be a little more conservative. And if you look at the assumptions
that we shared at the Capital Markets Day, we believe that the assumptions behind these sales forecasts are reasonable. We also recognize that
there is some uncertainty into the market. But of course, if we really see that is taking off, given the very sizable patient population, there's, of
course, a -- you can have more optimistic scenarios than what we have shared.

From the price ranges, $600 to $1,000 per patient revealed by Orexo, how much may be considered as gross profit, net profit? And then the third
question is who manages the system maintenance in market support of DTx ,Orexo, GAIA?

I can, of course, not right now share that number for gross profit and net profit, you would need to follow that when we report our financial numbers.
I can say basically, the cost we have for this is the royalty we are paying to GAIA that cost is different by product. And so we're paying a different
level of royalty for each product to GAIA. And that will be visible as we start reporting. But I would say if you compare our digital therapies it's very
comparable to a pharmaceutical where you have a royalty and a cost of goods sold. So the rise is a little higher than what you have to see for
pharmaceuticals, but then we don't have any cost of goods sold. And here, actually, I see, net profit is defined here is gross profit minus cost of
sales and royalty to GAIA. So for me, that was sort of just explained to gross profit.

And then there's a question about maintenance. And here, the way that's set up is that we pay a fixed fee to GAIA as a maintenance fee on an
annual basis. That's not included in the gross profit report that we have that will be under our running cost. And it is GAIA who is doing all of the
system maintenance, which is coming to the product. So when it comes to the reimbursement systems, the data analytics that we're building up,
customer support system, all of that is Orexo or companies that we work with from Orexo. So we don't have any IT team even internally yet. So it's
all through partnerships with different companies.

Then I have one here again. And so could you shed some light on the safety features of deprexis, particularly relating patients which are worsening
symptoms during the programs?

Mike or Dennis, can you comment on that? So what will happen with patients who are seeing worsening symptoms?

Michael Sumner - Orexo AB (publ) - Chief Medical Officer
So I mean, from a safety perspective, we obviously encourage people having such symptoms to reengage with their health care provider. To date,
there is -- and we as part of the instructions use, the patients are warned that such things could happen. But on the whole, based on the data we
have seen, this is a very infrequent event.

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
I can comment that when we were negotiating with GAIA, we have, of course, tested the products, of course, different employees tested the
product. And we took on a little different role and one of our employees was deliberately trying to become suicidal in the way that he described
his symptoms in the system. And the system basically came up with an immediate warning, say, we recommend that you immediately take contact
                                                                                                                                                                             
 with health care. And I believe there was even a phone number for the suicide helpline on the system. So it basically triggered. You should seek
help from the health care professional.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Okay. Are there any further questions?

Operator
We have one more question from the phone -- from the line of Gergana Almquist from Redeye.

Gergana Almquist - Redeye AB, Research Division - Equity Analyst
I have a question about the strategy of Orexo going forward because you compare to Livongo, but they own the technology. Do you plan to
develop your own technologies? Or will you continue in-licensing from GAIA?

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
No, that is correct. And there's, of course, other differences with Livongo. So they also had a device included, which, in some way, helped them in
the reimbursement process. But at the same time, if you look at the distribution model here, this -- the way that we are trying to build the control
of one very, very important step in the value chain, and that is the reimbursement and logistics systems. And those systems we all own -- we own
at Orexo. And while we, of course, are partners, a lot of the partners are different IT companies for helping us building this entire system. We will
also own all of the data analytics capacity that we have around this and how we're going to use this data. All of that is something that we right now
are using partners, but where we see that we will internalize some of these competencies. When it comes to the actual product, we will continuously
review opportunities for business development. I can't foresee the -- I can't see that we right now should start employing IT specialists to start from
a blank sheet of paper to build something. That is too long and it's too far away from our competencies. But what I do see is that Orexo can take a
very active role either in a partnership or as an acquirer of a company that sits with competencies and technologies that are proprietary to that
company. And in that way, building the system. And I will say that what we are looking for right now is to take some of all of the cash that we have
in the company and we're generating from Zubsolv to look for acquisition candidates who have proprietary technology that we find would be
valuable for the company moving forward. So -- but to start hiring IT specialists to start on a blank sheet paper is not in the strategy right now.

Gergana Almquist - Redeye AB, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Okay. And my next question is about the marketing and sales. Have you addressed or do you plan to address the largest employers in the U.S., like
Walmart, Amazon, I mean, large companies?

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
The short answer is yes. And the way that we -- but the way that we're looking at it is some of them, we will reach out to directly, and we are in
process of hiring people on that experience. But what we have found is that a lot of these large companies have partnerships already with different
suppliers who have a broad range of services. And the strategy we have is to reach out to distributors who already have that access to these large
employers. I've worked with this before, although that was in Sweden, where we -- when I worked at (inaudible), we were reaching out to companies
with a smoking cessation solution, but we quite fast found that a lot of them have different health partnerships with different suppliers, who as
part of that total package also have these smoking cessation solution. And when we start to partner up with them, that became much more efficient
distribution channel. And GoGoMeds is actually a good example of that because GoGoMeds is today selling services directly to some of these large
                                                                                                                                                                             
 employers that you just mentioned. So that's one distribution channel, but we don't see that they are an exclusive channel. We are actually discussing
actively with other companies who have that relationship established, who also provide other services.

Gergana Almquist - Redeye AB, Research Division - Equity Analyst
I understand. And in this mode of collaboration, I mean or this middleman, what kind of fees will they charge? Do you know about roughly?

Dennis Urbaniak - Orexo AB (publ) - EVP of Digital Health
We know the deal with GoGoMeds, but that's not something we share. So we will -- we can't -- we will -- you will see the financial list. We won’t
share the exact figures.

Operator
And that was the 1 question from the phone.

Nikolaj Sørensen - Orexo AB (publ) - President & CEO
Okay. I must admit, those of you who have been following us all the way until now, we are 15 minutes later than I think we have said we would. So
I appreciate that a lot. I appreciate the amount of questions both through the web and also those of you who have dialed in.

We had a very exciting time at Orexo and like I say, the energy in the organization is tremendous, despite having the COVID-19 obstacles that we,
like everyone else, have to address. But we're really looking forward to opening up our offices in the U.S. for all new colleagues that have been
hired during the last few months, so we can start to really create a new company focusing on digital therapies under the leadership of Dennis in
the U.S.

So thanks a lot for your attention today, and I hope all of you will have a great day. Goodbye.

It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Tony Milikin. Sir, you may begin.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Thank you. Welcome, and thank you for joining us. My name is, again, Tony Milikin. I'm the Chief Procurement and Sustainability Officer at AB InBev.
I'm excited to join you today and discuss what we at AB InBev are doing to build the company for the next 100 years.

So approximately about 3 years ago, Carlos Brito has moved sustainability under procurement to incorporate an agenda better suited for our
commercial strategy and to make sure we are addressing the sustainability challenges most important to our businesses. In my opinion, this is
Brito's greatest gift he could offered to our sourcing teams. Our procurement professionals have renewed purpose to engage our suppliers,
collaborate and innovate.

My teams oversee -- just to give you an idea, my teams oversee sourcing. We have vertical operations; sustainability, as I mentioned; and circularity.
And as for everybody on the call, circularity in our view is managing our waste. And we're looking -- we are working across different teams and
                                                                                                                                                                             
 functions in the business from marketing, supply to finance, from a global and a local point of view to embed sustainability in everything we do
as a company.

We have a strong history of sustainability at AB InBev, but our 2025 goals are our most ambitious yet, not only addressing what we're going to do
within our walls but also ensuring that our communities and environments where we live and work daily are thriving and resilient.

Now more than ever, our sustainability goals are relevant and business-critical. While the pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges for
our communities and businesses, our teams have shown tremendous ability and agility throughout the process. If anything, the pandemic has
strengthened our commitment to sustainability, and it's shown us that we have a set of right goals at the right time for the business and our
communities we operate. We're also learning quickly and sharing best practices across our global footprint, working collaboratively to build a
resiliency across our supply chain, whether it's making sure our farmers can continue to grow and sell their crops but also make sure that the cash
flow to them continues, to ensuring our small retailers can continue to not only operate but grow their businesses.

And so I'd like to, at this point, introduce you to Ezgi Barcenas. She's our Global Head of Sustainability. She's the brains behind the strategy and our
goals now. And so I'll introduce her to just take over now. And I look forward to joining you at the end of the presentation for your questions. Thank
you for being with us today. Ezgi, it's all yours.

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Thank you, Tony. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I'm Ezgi Barcenas. As Tony mentioned,
I'm the Global Head of Sustainability at AB InBev, and I've been with the company over 7 years. So I'm excited to speak with you today. Today, we'll
share with you an overview of our approach to sustainability, the key strategic pillars as well as programs that we put in place, all in order to
future-proof AB InBev.

You're all likely familiar with our company, but just to reiterate our size and scale, we operate in nearly 50 markets around the world, sustaining
over 5 million jobs globally and with about 50 million consumers buying our products daily. And we keep that global scale and local reach in mind
in how we show up in our communities every day, how we design our programs for supply security, for business continuity and community
resilience.

So we buy, make and sell over 90% of our products locally. This requires a healthy natural environment as well as thriving communities. And we're
building a company to last. And when you couple our diverse and global reach with our local focus, you see why sustainability isn't just part of our
business. It is our business.

And if you look at our entire value chain, you will see how at every touch point we invest in building vibrant, thriving communities a healthier
environment and a resilient value chain. And our sustainability strategy, as you can see on the screen, is a reflection of the UN Sustainable Development
Goals. We're an engine for local economic growth, and we proudly contribute to broader sustainable development, whether it's how we show up
to improve the livelihoods of our farmers, how we enhance the water availability and quality for our communities in high-stress areas or how we
champion the transition to a low-carbon economy, invest in road safety and green logistics in order to strengthen our communities and value
chain and also to strengthen micro and small enterprises at the end of our value chain, and these are just to name a few examples.

As I mentioned, sustainability makes business sense, and it's really very simple. At the core of it, sustainability is about supply security and business
continuity. When you think about raw material sourcing, water availability, this is why sustainability makes business sense. But it's also about our
own employees, our own employees that are increasingly seeking that sense of purpose, that sense of pride. We always say our greatest strength
is our people, and sustainability is a genuine concern for the modern workforce. So it's not only critical for talent attraction but also for talent
engagement and retention, and we know that.

Thirdly, with the rise of conscious consumerism, we're seeking -- we're seeing consumers are asking more questions about environmental and
social impacts and turning to their favorite brands, some of our most iconic brands, to step up in authentic, purpose-driven ways.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And we witnessed this trend for years. Our Stella Artois brand has spearheaded this internally and externally since 2014 through their partnership
with Water.org, which I'm sure many of you have seen, in order to provide water access to women and families in need. And more recently, our
Budweiser brand has championed our corporate efforts, which I'm really proud of, to switch to 100% renewable electricity by launching a campaign
in Davos a couple of years ago at the World Economic Forum and with one of the most successful and commendable Super Bowl ads last year to
tell the story of our commitment to renewable electricity for a more sustainable future.

Last but not least, sustainability is really truly all about innovation. It's about the future. We know we need to think about the future of agriculture.
We're thinking about the future of packaging, future of logistics, future of consumerism in our efforts to build the company for the next 100-plus
years. And it allows us to remain ambitious, differentiated and competitive.

So if you think about it, sustainability is, in fact, doing what we do better, whether it's sourcing the highest-quality ingredients, being efficient,
resourceful and effective with our resources or embracing new technologies and innovation or telling great stories about our iconic brand. As the
world's leading brewer, we remain firmly committed to creating a better world for all of our stakeholders while also creating value for our business.

So when we set out to redefine our sustainability strategy in 2017, following our transformational combination with SAB, we brought together 80
of our colleagues from around the world to create our next set of public commitments. So as you can see, sustainability is not a siloed team or
organization in our company. Colleagues from all of our 6 operating zones across procurement; supply, which is our operations team; logistics;
corporate affairs; and R&D teams came together to identify the most material issues and the biggest opportunities that we have in order to create
value for our business but also future-proof our value chain.

And these are the 4 pillars: agriculture, water, packaging and climate, that are core to our dream of building a profitable growth company, and
we're putting resources and effort behind them. We're also sharing targets linked to our compensation with hundreds of colleagues around the
world that are working across zones and across functions to deliver our sustainability goals.

I'd like to also note how we're taking an outward-in approach in every one of them. And this is really critical, and it's evident in our farmer-centric
approach to smart agriculture, our focus on communities and water availability and quality in high-stress areas, our commitment to protecting
and promoting our 2-way packaging, which I think is arguably the largest circular economy in the world and in how we're working with our supply
chain to reduce emissions and contribute to local grid transformation through additional renewable capacity that we're putting in place.

And we're making great progress towards our 2025 commitments only 2 years in. And what's not visible on this page is really the programs and
partnerships that we're putting in place to ramp up our efforts for 2025. And we're working hard to hold ourselves accountable with clearly defined
KPIs in true ABI fashion and an assurance process as part of our integrated reporting.

By having sustainability integrated into the core business, we have been able to quickly take action internally and across our value chain to deliver
early progress, which gives us confidence that we're on the right track, and we're proud to share some of the results with you today and some of
the programs we put in place.

So as we're building programs and partnerships to ensure 100% of our farmers are skilled, connected and financially empowered, we're investing
in economic guidance and remote field-level advice in order to improve farming practices, lower their environmental impact and improve farmer
productivity. Again, you can see how we're taking that farmer-centric approach in everything we do.

We're also investing in climate modeling and predictive analytics, so that we can better forecast risks and opportunities in our sourcing regions.
This is a key priority for us, and we're utilizing climate prediction data from NASA, which I think is a unique opportunity for us to demonstrate
practical use case applications of their data.

We're also making progress on regenerative agricultural efforts. And we're building out our global approach to soil health with our economists
and our partners, key partners like The Nature Conservancy and Sustainable Food Lab. In fact, you may have seen coverage a few months ago of
our Indigo Ag partnership with our rice farmers in the U.S., which showed really good results and provides learnings on how we can expand our
approach more broadly. Through this partnership with rice farmers and Indigo Ag in the U.S., we've seen over 20% reduction in water use, nearly

                                                                                                                                                                             
 15% reduction in nitrogen savings and over 25% reduction in methane production and all of this while increasing farmer profitability. So again,
sustainability makes business sense.

And we know that biodiversity will be high on the agenda in a post-pandemic world as COVID-19 has really exposed an urgent need for regeneration
and resilience. So we're working to build out a really robust strategy, which I'm really proud of, that includes biodiversity with partners like The
Nature Conservancy and Sustainable Food Lab, as I mentioned. In addition, with the pandemic, we're seeing growing inequality within and between
countries. And this makes our work with smallholder farmers all the more essential, both for our supply security and for their livelihood.

So we continue to invest in their resilience and the development of these vulnerable supply chains. And one way we do that, if I can give an example,
is by investing in technology solutions like BanQu. It's a blockchain-enabled platform to strengthen our smallholder sourcing through transparency
and empowerment, ensuring that farmers are paid a fair price and have greater access to financial services. It also helps us run these programs
more efficiently and effectively.

So across all of our agricultural programs, whether it's smallholder or commercial market, our local teams are partnering with farmers to implement
our responsible sourcing policy to ensure that farms are a safe place to work and that human rights are respected, a key element to building resilient
agricultural supply chain.

And if we move on to water, water is really our #1 ingredient in all of our products, and more importantly, it's a basic human right and a critical
resource for the health and well-being of our communities, which is why we've taken an outward-in approach, again, as I mentioned earlier, in our
water commitment strategy in order to ensure 100% of our communities to have measurably improved water availability and quality in high-stress
areas. This really enabled us to drive what some stakeholders have called a sector-leading agenda in water stewardship. Bringing accountability
and measurable improvement to our watershed work really positions us as the leader in this space and helps us manage our water risk more
effectively.

We're taking a science-based approach at each and every one of our high-stress watersheds. One example is the great results we're seeing out of
Bucaramanga in Colombia, where our collective efforts with partners like [GIV] has really allowed us to set up a water fund that, in addition to a
number of benefits, is helping retain over 2 million cubic meter of additional water annually in the ecosystem. It's really an incredible project. It's
the buffer zone of 13 municipalities, and our local team is doing a fantastic job bringing together all the key stakeholders and raising funding for
this project. Water security is very complex, and we can't do this alone.

Additionally, this past March, as part of the UN Global Compact, we also proudly cofounded a CEO-led cross-sector coalition to help inform corporate
water stewardship evolution and shape ambitions and frameworks into industry standards. Our own CEO, Brito, has been a champion of this
initiative, which marks the beginning of the water-positive future for all of us. Furthermore, we've been rated CDP Water A-lister. It's great to see
our efforts are being recognized in a world where water stress continues to be magnified by climate change.

If we move on to packaging. In packaging, we've set a really ambitious target to have 100% of our products be in packaging that's returnable or
made from majority recycled content. Through this commitment, we're really working hard to eliminate over 1 million tons of virgin materials from
our supply chain. I believe it's over 1.3 million tons, actually. We're investing in recycling programs, and we're co-innovating with suppliers and
commercial partners.

So you'll see on the left side of the slide that, in partnership with our marketing teams, we're also thinking about our environmental footprint in
sponsorships and events, so at every touch point, at every product that we put out in the marketplace. We're partnering with our R&D arm, our
GITEC team in Leuven, our Global Innovation and Technology Center in Leuven and our suppliers to explore more sustainable packaging options,
and also, we're looking for alternative solutions for plastic beyond primary packaging, which is really where the opportunity to make an impact
truly exists.

Another example, if I can give another example, is in markets like Brazil and Colombia and many others, we're also collecting ""lost"" glass bottles
and bringing them home through our accelerator start-ups that are improving our supply security, lowering costs and improving transparency
and dignity of those vulnerable supply chains as well.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 We're also working with our largest suppliers to think about the future of packaging. As I mentioned earlier, sustainability is really all about innovation
for us. So in China, for example, late last year, we brought together can sheet suppliers to better understand the gaps and opportunities in recycled
aluminum scrap, so that we can continue to identify opportunities for partnership.

Last but not least, we have over 50 circular packaging programs globally and more than 20 working with formal waster -- informal waste collectors.
And we're taking all those learnings from our agricultural programs in trialing BanQu in Zambia and Colombia. So it's our blockchain platform that
we utilize in our agricultural supply chain to bring greater transparency and financial access to waste collectors as well in these previously informal
markets.

In most collector programs, women make up about 50% to 60% and, in Zambia, even up to 70%, where the program is focused on increasing
women's participation. And we're really excited to take some of the learnings from these pilots to ensure that we're scaling social impact alongside
environmental impact across our circular packaging programs.

So when we think about carbon, our commitment to reduce 25% of our carbon emissions across value chain -- across our entire value chain is a
science-based target. It's approved by science-based targets initiative, and it's in line with our 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory. The biggest opportunity
in climate action truly for us is in value chain. In fact, over 80% of our carbon emissions are Scope 3 emissions. And it's really another reason why
sustainability and procurement need to go hand-in-hand in our efforts to build a more sustainable future and a more sustainable company.

In our 100% renewable electricity commitments, we're looking to convert over 5 terawatt hours of electricity from brown to green. And so far, we
contracted over 60% of our global volume to come from wind and solar power. And we continue to grow our understanding of the renewable
space and even proudly sit on the Advisory Committee of RE100 to work -- to provide best practices and recommendations on enabling policies
to governments and other local stakeholders around the world as we go from market to market, looking at renewable electricity opportunities.

We're also continuing to electrify our fleet wherever it makes sense, championing new technologies and innovations across our zones. And we
also launched a sustainability dedicated to supplier platform, named Eclipse. Some of you may have seen this. This program is fairly new. We
launched it late 2018, where we're working together with over 50 of our biggest suppliers to set a shared vision, identifying gaps and opportunities.
And the whole ambition here is to really co-innovate with our supply chain.

We've gotten an A- score in CDP Climate. We've also been recognized because of our great efforts in working with our supply chain as a CDP supplier
engagement leader. Again, we're really proud of these achievements, and huge thanks and shout-out to our procurement teams now for their
growing supplier collaboration efforts for sustainability.

We mentioned our accelerator program a couple of times when we gave the BanQu example. Our sustainability accelerator, our award-winning
100+ Sustainability Accelerator, was launched in 2018, and it continues to deliver really strong results. We created this to be an open platform to
support promising ideas and technologies to help us solve some of the biggest sustainability challenges that we face, that the world faces today.
And our 100+ Accelerator runs annual boot camps in 9 markets, followed by a 10-week program for select entrepreneurs to pilot test and scale
their solutions in our operations and value chain. And I think that's what makes our program really special because we truly pilot their solutions
and we test to see if their results are worth scaling.

12 out of 21 start-ups in our first cohort have received a commercial contract from us, and we're scaling up their solutions following the success of
their pilots. Collectively, our start-ups have raised over $200 million from prominent investors. So now we're in the second cohort. And they're
offering us the potential to capture over $80 million in savings by 2025 based on some of the solutions that we're seeing and scaling right now.

I mentioned BanQu before for agriculture. I also mentioned it in circular packaging. But just another example of one of our start-ups in the
sustainability accelerator, EW Tech, which is a green caustic soda replacement that's used in our breweries for cleaning purposes, really comes with
an incredible innovative solution that comes with huge water, energy and time savings, which then translate, of course, into cost savings for our
operations. So that's another solution that we identified out of Colombia that we're piloting and scaling and really excited about the results.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 This year, we're piloting in our second cohort. As I mentioned, we've got 17 start-ups. And again, the idea is to test game-changing solutions in our
field, in our watersheds for our consumers and with zero waste.

Maybe a few examples that I can provide. OKO is an Israeli company that's providing weather-indexed crop insurance to our body farmers in
Uganda, which is really a first for many of our smallholder farmers. Gybe is another one that's providing real-time water quality data in one of our
high-stress watersheds in agricultural supply chain in the U.S. We're also always in search of circular and renewable sources of water. So with Asarasi,
we're working to understand the opportunities in plant-based water for maple processing. This is -- if you think about it, this is really tree water
that's harvested harmlessly during maple syrup production. It is the by-product of maple syrup industry. And then with Nomo, we're investing in
the transparency of vulnerable recycling supply chains to collect bottles and improve the livelihood of waste pickers and, of course, lower our costs.
At every step, everything we do makes business sense for us.

And I think Tony mentioned this earlier. Our purpose has never been more relevant than it is today. COVID has strengthened our commitment to
building a better world, to bringing people together for a better world. And it's made the need for innovation and collaboration to support local
communities even more critical than ever before. So for us as a company, the health and safety of our colleagues, the supply chain partners, the
communities has always been our top priority, and that's what's informed our immediate response to the pandemic.

In agricultural supply chains, the relationships that we built throughout our programs over the years, with our farmers, the relationships that we've
built there and the digital platforms that we put in place have really enabled us to quickly adopt to market disruptions because of the pandemic,
whether it was managing through the harvest, getting farmers feeds and inputs, ensuring that farmers have the information and support they
need to produce a quality crop because they rely on that economic guidance from our economists. And because of this, we've been able to maintain
supply throughout this entire time, and we've had no interruptions, and we're really proud of that. We're really proud of the local connections and
local investments we're making in these farmers.

And we also -- I think it's worth noting that we also continue to support our farmers by keeping buying sites open, operating safely with protective
equipment, of course, which is critically important for farmers' cash flow. We also are working to ensure their access -- they have access to credit
and inputs. We're offering health and safety training and remote economic advice and guidance, as I mentioned, using radio or SMS, where if a
smartphone is not available, we're using radio and SMS to reach smallholder farmers that we typically need in person but we can't now because
of the pandemic.

In water, we were able to produce and donate nearly 3 million bottles of hand sanitizers and disinfectants to hospitals and frontline workers in
20-plus countries. This is, of course, especially critical in communities that face water access or water availability challenges. Water security is very
complex. There's no single solution, as I mentioned, and we continue to invest in our community resilience.

We also work with the waste pickers in our recycling supply chains to ensure their safety and well-being. And we haven't stopped partnering with
our suppliers throughout the pandemic. Our Eclipse platform is really a first of its kind in the beverage industry. And then throughout the pandemic,
we've offered educational webinars, workshops with sector experts from RE100, Goldman Sachs and Albion Power and others, really providing
opportunities to share best practices and continue to learn from each other. The idea here is how do we continue to learn from each other and
collaborate on critical enablers that we need for that transition to a low-carbon economy.

So we're really committed to building a company for the next 100-plus years, to bringing people together for a better world. And we'll continue
to invest in local supply chains and communities because we really believe that the future is local. And we're constantly looking for ways to design
for resilience and to build the long-lasting change. And our own CFO, Fernando Tennenbaum, has joined as a founding member to the UN Global
Compact CFO Taskforce for the SDGs a couple of weeks ago, to bring the corporate finance and sustainability world closer together, and we're
really proud of this. And the idea here is to continue to identify innovative financing mechanisms to ensure that we're tackling material issues to
our business and solving shared challenges with our communities across the world.

So in closing, thank you for your time today. I'm really excited to be here with Tony. We hope you have a more thorough understanding of our
sustainability strategy and ambition. Some of you may have heard it for the first time. Some of you may be following our sustainability journey for
                                                                                                                                                                             
 quite some time now. And we're really excited about the progress that we're making. We don't have all the answers, but we're looking forward to
learning, testing and scaling solutions.

So I'll -- maybe without further ado, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.

Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Beverages Research & Fundamental
Research Analyst
Great. A couple of questions. Obviously, in -- when you're in the beer business, relations with governments is very important. And all of these issues
that you discuss and sustainability are important to governments and their populations. I was wondering if you can talk about that side a little bit,
how maybe these efforts are integrated with your local community and government relationship teams, whether you've seen any tangible benefits
from that in terms of tax credits perhaps and ability and license to operate. So that would be the first question.

And then the second question. Perhaps, is -- are there any advantages that you can quantify on the capital expenditure side from these efforts?
Obviously, it can be more efficient with waste that there should be some tangible results. Any way to quantify any of that?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Thank you. Thank you for your question. Of course, as I mentioned, the future is local. We're continuing to invest in our local communities everywhere
we work. So whether you look at our efforts in agriculture or in water or in packaging or in climate action, everything we do, we do with our local
stakeholders, right? We can't do this alone. So we have to work through industry associations. We have to work very closely with our government
affairs, industry affairs and corporate affairs teams around the world.

And sustainability is really our business, and we set the goals that are material to our business. So we continue to have the right conversations,
knock on doors to figure out what the opportunities are around the world. And we have great relationships around the world with governments,
and we don't really comment on taxation. But yes, we are seeing an emergence of conversations on green taxation. So I think a lot of our efforts
and the way that we continue to invest in solutions and innovations are going to put us in -- position us well in the future as we see more policies
up here.

What we're really looking for here is the enabling policies and the regulatory backbones that are needed for us to invest in new technologies. And
if you think about renewables, for example, we're taking our learnings from one market to another. And we're sharing with our supply chain, with
our suppliers, with the local authorities what some of our learnings are.

If I can give one example, in Argentina, I believe, it was in Argentina where the government opened a brief consultation period with companies
and public and experts and scientists. And we weighed in on that. We weighed in on what we expect to see from the technology and how companies
like ours are looking forward to scaling these technologies, so that, again, our approach to sustainability really goes beyond being efficient. We're
focusing on how we can be resourceful, how we can champion innovation around the world and by leveraging our core competencies. So yes,
absolutely, we're working very closely with local stakeholders, including government.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Hey, Robert, with your second question, not like by quantifying, but it's good to talk to you. The thing that you need to know is that when you were
with us back in '08, when I started the company, we were about 6 liters to produce 1 liter of beer. We've made those investments, and now we're
down to 2.8, and we're on our way towards as -- getting as low as the water use there is.

I think the other part is that when you start thinking about investments, we look at this from a procurement standpoint. We're working with our
suppliers. And everything that we're doing right now, so if you think about renewable electricity, our costs now are lower. If you think about bottles,
our recyclability content in those bottles, that's actually less carbon footprint, less carbon being used and lower cost to us. So the whole supply
chain of those cutlet coming back to the glass factories.

Same thing with cans. I mean if you look at aluminum around the world, there's plenty of aluminum. We just got to get it back into the cans. And
so when you think about that, it's lower on our carbon footprint and lower cost, ultimately. So everything that we're doing, we look from an
efficiency, but it's also about being effective. And so hopefully, Robert, I've answered your question best we can.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of [Lisa Lang] of [Federal Adherence].

Unidentified Analyst
First of all, thanks so much for this presentation. It's really good to get some insights on your sustainability approach. What I felt really interesting
is that you said you -- for your sustainability targets, you have very clear KPIs. And you also said you're working a little bit more on biodiversity. So
I was wondering if you could share a little bit more on that, in particular, what KPIs you're considering to measure your impact on biodiversity.

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. Thank you. This is something that we're looking at very closely, as I mentioned, because in agriculture, it is really about shifting behaviors and
introducing new technology and innovations. So we're testing. We're testing new technologies and new farming practices through partners like
Indigo Ag, and I've given some examples there.

For me, at the end, what it really comes down to is good agricultural practices, right? So someone may call it regenerative agriculture. Someone
else may call it smart agriculture or conservation agriculture, right? At the end, we really want to be very mindful of our resources, whether it's
water and water quantity or quality, right, because the runoffs and the fertilizer use also make an impact in water quality; or whether it's soil health.
And it really -- this is what it comes down to. And for us, those are some of the metrics that we continue to check. It's this water quality, quantity,
soil health and yes, so similar topics like that.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Forry of Investec.

Alicia Ann Forry - Investec Bank plc, Research Division - Consumer Analyst
Thanks very much for these insights. It's very interesting. My 2 questions are: one, you talk about farmer security being critical. But ABI is also pretty
well known for having quite an aggressive days payable outstanding position, i.e., you're very tight on your working capital. So I'm just curious
how you square that circle and where trade-offs occur. And then secondly, I'm curious, given your broad geographic spread, if you notice a difference
in consumer and government acceptance of sustainability across the various regions, if you notice any differences, that would be interesting.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Ezgi, let me address the payment side of it. Yes, we are aggressive. And yes, we're very smart about how we do cash management. But it's not a
one rule for everything. We're very smart about segregating our supply chain or our suppliers. And so when you look at our farmers, especially our
small shareholders or stakeholders, sorry -- I'm sorry, small suppliers out there, we address that differently on our cash management.

I think the other part would be is this. We're looking at our small farmers. So I'll just give you an example. Ezgi brought up BanQu earlier, a blockchain
solution. And in that situation, we didn't even -- we couldn't even see our suppliers. So it did not even have a financial identity. And so we didn't
fully understand our ability to get the money to those farmers, those small, small farmers. And so through BanQu, we basically unlocked that. And
ultimately, now those farmers have a financial identity. We're working directly with them through blockchain to make sure they are paid on time
and in an expedited manner, instead of going through a broker and then going into a black box.

So I think when you start looking at how we are addressing our supply chain and how we make those payment decisions, you can rest assured
we're doing our best to make sure that we have a differentiated way of going to market.

The second question, Ezgi, on consumers. I didn't -- repeat that question, and then I'll get back to that.

Alicia Ann Forry - Investec Bank plc, Research Division - Consumer Analyst
Yes, sorry. It's really just across the different regions, do you notice differences in consumer and government's level of acceptance or interest in
sustainability. Are there variations?

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Wow. I got to say -- Ezgi, do you want to go with that? I've got another thing, so go on.

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. Of course, we see variation across the markets, right, just like you would in anything that you look at. One thing I would say is, definitely, we
are seeing the rise of conscious consumers. As I mentioned, we're seeing the rise of health and well-being. We're seeing a focus on locally sourced
products. So all of these things are trends that we've been following for years. But also we're seeing from consumer groups how they want to
choose brands that share the same values and principles that they do as individuals. And that may vary depending on where you are in the world
and your market conditions. There are, of course, nuances within your local context. But I would say more developed countries are likely to be more
in tune with environmental challenges and environmental risks out there, whereas some of the developing country consumers are focused more
on social development and economic empowerment.

So we have a wide variety of ways in how we engage with our consumers, and it really goes back to that local context and what's the most pressing
topics in that market and how they expect our brands to show up or our local operating businesses to show up in those communities every day.
So yes, there is a variety that we see around the world.

Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Stirling of Bernstein.

Trevor J. Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior Analyst
Just one question from my side. Ezgi, I think you referred in the presentation to returnable glass bottles as the ultimate circular packaging. But
historically, in developed markets, there's been a lot of resistance both from consumers and retailers to that system. Do you think there's any scope
for reintroducing returnable glass bottles into developed markets? I'm just thinking maybe there -- if [present tune] can train people into not flying,
can they -- can there be a certain movement towards returnable glass bottles?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. Thank you, Trevor. I think this is, honestly, one of our biggest opportunities as a company and as citizens of this planet. As I mentioned, our
circular packaging commitment really gives us that -- empowers us to continue to protect and promote our returnable volumes. As you mentioned,
as markets mature and consumers opt for more one-way solutions, more convenient solutions, we see a decline in returnable volumes. And we've
seen that for years. And our marketing teams are working relentlessly to meet the consumers where they are and also protecting some of those
infrastructures and cultural norms.

If I can give some examples, in Colombia, we are -- together with one of our start-ups, accelerator start-ups, Nomo, specifically, we're working to
improve the consumer journey. We're using our waste collection system to collect empty glass bottles to be cleaned and refilled. So again, trying
to make it more convenient for the consumers.

In Brazil, we're looking at new returnable solutions with some of our biggest brands, a new returnable long neck with our Brahma Duplo Malte that
we're launching. And we're using Corona more broadly and -- to support our circular packaging goal. But I think most -- one of the initiatives that
really excites me the most in the U.S., how we're working with one of our start-ups, again, in the accelerated program. It's called Conscious Container.
We're piloting returnable bottles. In a market like the U.S., that has been one way since 1980s. So this is something that we're really excited about.
We're not only trying to slow down this trend but maybe even reverse it, and we know how incredibly difficult it this is, but we are looking at
solutions. We're trying to pay more attention to what the consumers of today are asking because, again, going back to the earlier question, we are
seeing a shift in consumer behavior. And yes, there may be a moment in time when the consumers will go back to returnables, maybe even in a
market like the U.S.

So stay tuned. We'll definitely share the results of that pilot by the end of the year when our second cohort graduates from the second -- from the
accelerator program.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Hey, Trevor, it was a fantastic question because that's the one that we think about. There's a couple of angles on this. It's deals with the consumer,
deals with the retailer, but I'd also just say that when you look at -- I'll just use the U.S. because I think that's some of the areas you're pointing to.
Look at the states that have deposit loss, and then look at -- once they make waste actually a currency, you see that, that actually gets into the
recycling market. I think that's one part of it.

The second part of it is our teams are working with our suppliers right now to see if one-way bottles can be used more than once, all right? And so
the design of returnable bottles is totally different than the one-way bottles. But is there the science within the glass that allows us to use one-way
bottles, right, currently, if we can get them returned, can we use them multiple times? And so there's a lot of work going on with our teams just to
see how we can keep the life of the bottle and continue in its life to be more -- used more than once.

Our next question comes from the line of Celine Pannuti of JPMorgan.

Celine A.H. Pannuti - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Head of European Food, Home, Personal Care & Tobacco and Senior Analyst
Yes. I hope you can hear me. I have 2 questions. The first one, you mentioned earlier some of the savings that you were able to do on this sustainability
journey. I'm also wondering if there are as well costs associated with that. We heard some of the other companies, the subsector are spending a
lot of money in terms of packaging, trying to find alternative or setting up funds. I presume as well, electricity must be more expensive when you
buy green ones. So could you share your thoughts on that? That's my first question.

And my second question is on the -- your direct farmers you're pledging on the agriculture pledge you've made. How much of your buying is linked
with direct farmers? And how do you do on what is not linked to that to ensure that there as well a sustainable way that this agriculture or farmers
are treated or behaving?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. Thank you for your questions. So maybe I'll start with the second one. In agriculture, when you look at barley, which is our largest crop, about
50% of our global barley volume we buy directly from farmers. So those are the farmers that are in scope of our public commitment of ensuring
that they are skilled, connected and financially empowered. So right now, we're trying to -- we're fortunate, I believe, as a business that we have a
short and simple supply chain compared to other companies out there of our size and scale.

So that said, we still are trying to close the gap on transparency into that direct supply chain. So about 50% of that volume -- that barley volume
that comes from direct farmers, direct relationship with farmers. So we're investing in blockchain technology like BanQu to be able to really pinpoint
exactly which farmer and which farm that barley came from, and we continue to invest in those local operations.

But I think your question -- and the direct farmer volume is -- I think it varies depending on the year. It's a little bit less than 50%. But we're also
working with our malt suppliers. I think you're raising a great point on how are we working with our indirect supply chain, and we're working very
closely with our malt suppliers to look at the other half. And our Europe team is really spearheading this effort. They're working very closely with
their suppliers and especially their malt suppliers to better understand what are some of the environmental considerations or social considerations
that sit within that volume. But great question. Thank you.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Yes. Ezgi, let me add on to that. I think when you talk about maltsters, we're one of the largest maltsters in the world, I mean, our vertical operations.
And so we have our own KPIs of operating, and we work closely with our suppliers to compare those benchmarks back and forth. So whether water
usage, the amount of energy, waste, just everything that goes into malting, we're pretty good at it ourselves, and we work closely with our suppliers.
So you find the actual benchmarking between our suppliers and our verticals is very, very healthy and robust, and that helps us lower all our costs
and become much more sustainable over time.

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. And we -- I was just going to go back to your first question. Sorry, go ahead.

Celine A.H. Pannuti - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Head of European Food, Home, Personal Care & Tobacco and Senior Analyst
Yes. No, that's all good.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. And I may turn it over to Tony. I believe, if I understood you correctly, you were asking about how do we invest in these programs and how
do we handle the cost of these initiatives. So maybe I'll turn it over to Tony to talk a little bit about how everything we do really has a very strong
ROI.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
Yes. Well, when we talk to our suppliers, we're working with our suppliers, I mean, there's a lot of just pure procurement that comes into it. But I'll
just give you some -- I'll give you an example. In Europe, when we're actually buying corrugated, which is a secondary packaging for us, we're
actually finding out the green of the supplier, which means the supplier that has invested more in sustainability actually has a lower cost. And so
the ones that have not made those capital improvements and had a focus towards sustainability, they actually are not being able to compete. And
I'm just giving you that example, but you start looking across whether it's the can industry, which we're the largest can buyer in the world. Whether
we make the cans ourselves or we're buying, we're the largest in the world. So those companies that are most green tend to win our business, and
it's on the pure economics, but it's also because of their thoughtfulness and making it part of their strategy. And it's always at a positive ROI. We
have exceptions, but in general, it's really around smart business.

I'd say, the only exception out there for everybody who's listening is water. Water is the one that is -- we've got to invest. But I would tell you, it's
really about working closely with our competitors in the beverage industry. We all have a situation of dealing with water. It's precious. It's our most
precious resource. You can talk to anybody in the beverage industry, but let's just talk about beer. You can make beer with other raw materials,
whether it's malt, corn, sorghum, cassava and any other type of starches, but you cannot make beer without water. And so that's our most critical
resource. And we know that we can't do it by ourselves, and we're looking to partner with every one of the other beverage companies and
competitors to do a better job.

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. And if I can quickly comment on that water comment from Tony. Absolutely, I think this is where if you actually take a closer look at our public
commitment of having 100% of our communities to have measurably improve water availability and quality, you will see that we are trying to
bring that sense of accountability into that commitment. That measurable improvement piece is really incredible there because if you look at prior
corporate efforts, there has been discussions of replenishment, replenishing back in the same watershed, replenishing another watershed and
offsetting.

Our previous commitment was around protecting watersheds. All of those are great. But they are not -- water risk is very local. It's not like carbon.
So you need to identify what the context-based metrics are that you need to track, so that you can look back and say, ""Okay, now my investment
has paid off, and I have measurably improved the watershed health or the quality and availability of water to my business and the communities
that are at it."" So we need to continue to invest in those long-term restoration conservation efforts in water. And we're bringing that accountability
on ourselves and on our partners, like The Nature Conservancy and WWF who've been working very closely with us to better understand what are
those key indicators at the watershed level, everywhere around the world, where there is high risk for us to continue to monitor and track, so we
can improve the watershed health but also better track what the ROI is.

Tony Milikin - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Chief Procurement, Sustainability & Circular Ventures Officer
I think the other part of the question, Ezgi, was around buying green or green certificates, and that's not part of our strategy. Our part of our strategy
is to actually do the hard work. It's not to piggyback on somebody else's work. It's about us doing the hard work and making the investments
working with our supply chain.

Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Stern of AllianceBernstein.

Nicholas Stern
It's great to see you guys actually put some metrics down in relation to your goals. I know from some of your competitors, they give us their targets
but not actually any KPIs that they're tracking. So that's great to see. One question I had was in regards -- you mentioned earlier with
compensation-linked targets. I was hoping you guys could provide a little more context or clarity around that. Is that for -- is that in relation to your
sustainable goals you outlined before? Is that for the executive branch -- or sorry, the executive compensation? And just could you potentially
provide some examples of what those may be?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. Absolutely. So maybe like let me take a step back and tell you a little bit more about how sustainability is managed within the company. We
sit within the procurement organization, but we have an internal sustainability council made up of 4 chiefs who meet monthly to review our
progress and to continue to provide guidance and weigh in on our efforts. And those are Tony on the line who's our Chief Procurement, Sustainability
Officer. We have our Chief Supply Officer, Pete Kraemer; Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer, John Blood; and Chief Marketing Officer, Pedro
Earp. So the council oversees our sustainability commitments and strategy. And in addition to that, we have a bi-monthly or sometimes, if needed,
more frequently review, with Brito on the sustainability agenda. So we are very close to leadership at the highest levels in the company, and we
continue to get their input and guidance on how we build our strategy.

I would also add that our Board is very engaged on the topic of sustainability. They really understand what's material to our business. And we
typically have at least 2 updates annually to the Board on our progress against the commitments. And of course, there is other frequent updates
as well on supply security sourcing strategy, which, again, goes back to our raw materials and water efforts that we discussed before, our packaging
efforts that we discussed before.

So all of that to say that sustainability strategy is really governed at the highest levels within the company with at least 1 C-suite member carrying
a target on sustainability annually, and that would be Tony. But I would say that our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, John Blood, also carries targets
linked to our broader, better world strategy. Depending on the year, we may even have -- we don't carry a target. Again, it depends on how the
target is written and how it ladders up. But again, it depends on the year, but at least 1 C-suite every year carries a target linked to their variable
compensation, that will be their bonus.

And we treat sustainability like we would treat any other business initiatives, so it becomes part of our target setting and cascading process, which
is very rigorous inside the company. And our global team leads on the strategy and then works very closely with the local teams across different
zones and functions to cascade down the target that follow a very clearly outlined road map that will get us to our 2025 goals. So that's really how
we integrate sustainability into our business priorities because we see them as business priorities, and it's not just sustainability or procurement
teams that carry these targets. Depending on the year, you may have someone on the people team, marketing team, R&D, brewery operators. We
really can't get all the way down because we can't do this alone. We rely on a big team of teams to achieve these. But yes, we're really proud of
how we connected to our target setting and cascading process and to our bonuses as well. It really helps drive alignment very quickly inside the
company.

Our final question will come from the line of Edward Mundy of Jefferies.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Edward Brampton Mundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
I've got a couple. The first is comments made on the opening presentation, but can you remind us what proportion of your volumes are you buying
in local crops to then benefit from taxation breaks, for instance, with sorghum? And do you have a target to roll that out or an actual target you're
aiming for as a proportion of your volumes?

The second question is around the slide where you have responded to COVID with the likes of the hand sanitizer. Could you perhaps provide a bit
more color on the other side of the pandemic? As we go into the recovery phase, what other plans do you have in place to support the communities
to get them back on their feet, which would also boost your recovery?

And then the third question is going back to Slide 5. I know it's slightly off-topic from sustainability, but it's one of your important -- your 10 factors
that's for the UN's SDGs. When it comes to smart consumption, could you remind us of this target to get to 10% lower, and where are we? And is
that the ultimate cap? Or do you think you can go beyond the 10%?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
Yes. So I think there were a number of questions in there. Could you go over them really quickly? I think your first question was around the percentage
of crops that we buy locally and if we have any tax breaks that we get. This is a small percentage of our volume, but it's growing rapidly. It started
in sub-Saharan African markets. So this is something that's growing, and we're seeing it around the world. Now we expanded it to Latin America
and in Peru, Ecuador and 5 states in Brazil. So those are our -- kind of part of our affordability strategy to ensure that we're investing in subsistence
crops and commercializing them, so that we can continue to put out new innovations in the marketplace but also improve the livelihood of the
farmers and also to bring new consumers into the category, right? Because again, this is part of the affordability strategy that's incredibly linked
to the commercial strategy. And we're taking a lot of the learnings from our SAB operations and applying them now in Latin America. So very small
percentage of the volume but growing, and we're excited to see the learnings. And again, once something works, we definitely make sure that we
scale it up.

Edward Brampton Mundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
You don't have any formal -- no formal targets at this stage in terms of how big you expect that to get to?

Ezgi Barcenas - Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV - Global VP of Sustainability
We have targets at the local level that the teams are operating against. But no, we have not set any public commitments externally. We don't have
a global target that we can share with you, but we do have targets at the local level because we have set a strategy, right? So once you have a
strategy, then you set the targets and KPIs, so that the local teams can drive progress towards that.

Your question on hand sanitizers, as we go into recovery, how are we continuing to support the community. I believe Brito has spoken on this
multiple times as well. For us, health and safety of our communities was our kind of first response to the pandemic, and that, soon after, we quickly
figured out how to make hand sanitizers and disinfectants and then -- and share those with our communities and with also frontline workers. As
we go into recovery, we are part of the communities, right? So our government affairs teams, our local supply teams, we're working very closely
with everyone to better understand the local needs.

I think maybe one piece that I can quickly highlight here is -- and you may have heard this again in other meetings is how we will continue to
support our retail partners. We supported them from the beginning. But as we shift our focus from response to recovery around the world, what
we're doing now is working more closely with the local pub bars and restaurants that have been forced to close their doors as part of the measures
announced to contain the pandemic, this pandemic. And these are places that we gather with our friends and colleagues, and in many ways, we
really think that these are the heart and soul of our business. So we launched a series of initiatives to prompt financial support during this time of
uncertainty to these retailers.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And I believe today, we have over -- we have live initiatives, what I would call live initiatives, ongoing initiatives in over 20 countries around the
world that support more than 23,000 POCs. So again, this is a growing number. As societies are opening, we're continuing to figure out the needs
of our retailer partners. Some examples are there in our Cafe Courage program. [Pub bars] in the U.S. was open for takeout program. We've got
several others. But again, we're working with a sense of urgency. Our teams around the world are continuing to explore the opportunities in which
we can continue to support our business partners. Yes, so we have a number of them. And at the end, we want our suppliers and our customers
alike, we want them to thrive. So you will see that recovery support ongoing.

I believe those were all your questions. Oh, I think your last question was on the UN SDGs, I think you referenced. And then you asked about our
no- and low-alcohol volumes. We're continuing to make progress there, taking the learnings from one market to another. Our commitment is to
get to at least 20% of our global beer volume to be low- or no-alcohol beer products. We believe that providing consumers with high-quality no-
and low-alcohol beers, which we call NABLAB, can play really an important role in reducing harmful consumption of alcohol. So in 2019, I think this
was published in our report as well, NABLAB accounted for about 7% of our global beer volume. And to date, we have over 80 NABLAB offerings
for different consumer occasions. So this is just one way of how we approach reducing ample consumption of alcohol. Another one is looking to
place guidance labels on all our beer products in all of our markets, ensuring that we're increasing alcohol health literacy by 2025.

We're also investing in social norms campaigns to shift individual behavior, so that we can reduce ample consumption of alcohol. So there's a lot
of programs that are really evidence-based programs that we're working with our experts to shift social norms and behaviors on one hand but also
to continue to offer choices to our consumers through products -- NABLAB products on the other hand.

So I think that was probably our last question, unless there is another question queued up. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us today. We
really enjoyed speaking with you, sharing with you a little bit more about how we think about sustainability, how we approach our programs, how
we continue to invest in our supply chain and community resilience. Excited to keep the dialogue going, and looking forward to seeing you next
time. Thank you.

For those shareholders attending the meeting online, please follow the virtual meeting online guide via the link on your screen to, firstly, register
for a voting card and cast your votes online; and secondly, to ask questions or make comments on the company. You will only be able to ask
questions or make comments once you've registered to vote. I would invite shareholders attending online to send through any questions as soon
as possible after registration rather than waiting until each resolution is read.

The notice of meeting has been made available to all shareholders, and if there's no objection, it will be taken as read.

The procedure for today's meeting will be as follows. First, I will give a short address. This will be followed by the Managing Director and CEO's
address to shareholders. We will then move on to the formal items of business as set out in the notice of meeting.

All items of business will be voted on via a poll rather than a show of hands. Instructions regarding the poll will be given prior to commencement
of the poll, and assistance will be available to any shareholders who have queries during the polling process. The results of the poll will be tallied
                                                                                                                                                                             
 and announced via the ASX platform as soon as they are available. After the poll has closed, shareholders will have an opportunity to ask questions
about, or make comments on, the management of the company.

The 2020 financial year was one that demonstrated Perenti's ability to not only successfully navigate unprecedented events but also deliver very
strong results in the process. This is a testament to the depth and agility of the group and the high-caliber team we have built across the business
who were able to rapidly respond to the challenges we faced in the year.

In my address today, I'd like to expand on a few of the key operational and financial achievements we have delivered during the past 12 months.
I will then invite Mark Norwell to give us an insight into the strategic initiatives progressed throughout the year and how these will possession --
position, sorry, Perenti for growth and the successes we have had to date in the 2021 financial year.

Firstly, it goes without saying that the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus tested the resolve of our people and the business. The commitment and
response to the COVID-19 situation by our team has been outstanding. This was particularly the case with our expatriate workforce as many of
them elected to stay on or fly back to site as the pandemic intensified, which meant working away from their families and friends for extended
periods of time.

It's a credit to our internal COVID-19 task force and the broader Perenti team that amidst the flight cancellations and COVID-19 border restrictions,
our first expatriate crew changes were arranged and successfully completed in May 2020, and these continue across all of the company's international
operations today. This measure was one of many that contributed to Parenti only experiencing isolated COVID-19 operational effects across its
projects during FY '20 and enabled the business to deliver a very strong financial performance in FY '20. This included delivering record revenue
of $2.04 billion, exceeding the $2 billion mark for the first time in the company's history, and record underlying earnings before interest and tax of
$444 million.

The group had strong cash conversion at 96%, reflecting the company's high-quality earnings, and maintained return on capital employed above
16%, in line with our strong focus on capital discipline under the Group 2025 strategy.

Crucially, our strong liquidity position was further enhanced in the year as a result of our focus on capital management, ensuring the company was
and remains well placed to withstand the ongoing global economic challenges from COVID-19 and has greater flexibility to fund growth opportunities.

Prior to the onset of COVID-19, in November 2019, a terrorist attack near the Boungou project in Burkina Faso resulted in the tragic loss of 19
members of our workforce and injured a further 26. In response to the senseless attack, we provided rapid and ongoing care and support to the
injured employees and the families, friends and work colleagues of those who tragically lost their lives or were injured. Our thoughts continue to
be with them. As a result of this attack and continuing security issues in the Northern and Eastern regions of Burkina Faso, Perenti executed the
Boungou and Bissa projects.

It is also with sadness that I report that in June 2020, a heavy vehicle incident occurred at AngloGold Ashanti's Obuasi gold mine in Ghana, which
resulted in the tragic fatality of an underground mining alliance employee, Justice Sarkodie. UMA, which is an incorporated joint venture between
our subsidiary, African Underground Mining Services; and Ghanaian contracting company, Rocksure International, has placed the utmost importance
in supporting the family, local community and colleagues of Justice. Through UMA, an investigation was undertaken into the cause of the fatality
in conjunction with AngloGold Ashanti and the Ghanaian authorities with lessons from this tragic event applied to the Obuasi mine and where
applicable across our business.

Operationally, a key highlight in FY '20 was our ability to build on the successful Barminco acquisition in FY '19. A key example was the geographic
expansion of our underground service offering into high-quality mining jurisdictions with the award of underground mining services contracts
from Barrick Gold in Canada and Khoemacau in Botswana, together with a combined $1 billion. Underground delivered a standout financial and
operational performance through the Barminco and AUMS businesses across both Australia and Africa in FY '20.

Our surface ISG recorded a stronger result in the second half of FY '20, reflecting progress made in transforming AMS, our surface business in Africa.
We were also successful in securing more than $550 million in surface contract extensions and new work during FY '20.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 The Board believes that Perenti's ability to deliver excellent financial results in a year that experienced significant and unexpected challenges is a
positive reflection on the executive team's performance and the strength of the business. Accordingly, the Board reached a strong consensus that
the executive team's performance exceeded expectations and that the business is well positioned for growth.

In consideration of this performance, the Board approved FY '20 STI rewards, including the inclusion of the cash conversion target. The cash
conversion target was linked to the NPAT, net profit after tax, however the Board considered the benefit to shareholders through strong cash
management through COVID-19 by management and subsequently approved this portion of the bonus to ensure an alignment of benefits to
shareholders and management. Even with the inclusion of the cash conversion component, the overall bonuses were substantially lower than in
FY '19 due to the fact that the NPAT result was down against the stretch target included in the scorecard and due to the safety performance.

There have also been changes at the Board level since the 2019 AGM. I was delighted to welcome Andrea Hall as a nonexecutive director in December
2019. Andrea has brought extensive directorship experience to Perenti that aligns with the company's strategy to provide shareholders with
balanced representation, diversity and skill sets to underpin our long-term strategic vision. She was recently appointed as Chair of the Audit and
Risk Committee. I'd like to welcome her here today. I should also note that Rob Cole was recently appointed to the role of Deputy Chair.

In addition, I'd like to make special mention of Terry Strapp. Terry agreed at my request to remain on the Board beyond his intended retirement
date and will now retire at the end of December this year. He was first elected to the Board of the company on 21 July 2005. He has made a fantastic
contribution during his time on the Board, and his wisdom and experience will be missed by all and in particular, by me. This will be his last AGM
as a Board member but hopefully not as last as a shareholder. So thank you again, Terry, for your contribution.

A key component of the Board's focus is on strengthening Parenti's organizational health under the Group 2025 strategy, which includes enhancing
our environmental, social and corporate governance measures. To that end, I'm pleased we developed our inaugural sustainability report in this
year's 2020 annual report. This has been a step towards Perenti's long-term intention to enhance reporting and performance in this area with a
range of ESG initiatives we are targeting. In addition, we have made tangible improvements to our governance procedures such as implementing
a new code of conduct and policies.

In closing, I would like to sincerely thank Perenti shareholders. I recognize the important steps taken in response to the COVID-19 with regards to
our prudent cash management approach may have affected some shareholders, in particular, our decision in March 2020 to defer payment of the
company's interim dividend until October 2020. Hopefully, the decision to reactivate the dividend reinvestment plan was of some assistance.
However, as the situation developed and the strong measures taken by Mark and the group executive team took effect, including those to strengthen
our liquidity position, the Board had greater certainty by June 2020 to bring forward the interim dividend of circa $15 million to 23 July 2020. In
addition, with our strong financial performance in FY '20, the Board determined a final dividend of $0.035 per share, bringing the full year dividend
payments to $0.07 per share fully franked and reflecting our commitment to provide value to shareholders.

I'm immensely proud of how Parenti has risen to the occasion in the face of adversity over the past 12 months. The Board is very grateful to Mark
and the management team for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during extremely challenging times. This has positioned the company
for a very bright future that Mark will talk more about in his address.

So thank you, and I will now hand over to Mark.

Mark Alexander John Norwell - Perenti Global Limited - Group MD, CEO & Director
Thank you, Chairman, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm proud to be leading a company that has shown incredible resolve in the face
of considerable challenge presented during the 2020 financial year. The way we responded has further cemented Perenti's position as a leading
global mining services provider that creates enduring value and certainty for its stakeholders.

I'm particularly proud of the commitment our people demonstrated as COVID-19 rapidly emerged across the globe. The dedication of our team
to proactively identify and manage the challenges presented by the pandemic ensured the company only experienced isolated COVID-19 impacts
in FY '20. This can be seen in our very strong financial results for the year with record revenue of more than $2 billion, record underlying EBITDA

                                                                                                                                                                             
 of $444 million, cash conversion of 96% and a strong return on capital employed at 16.6%, all impressive numbers by any measure. We entered FY
'21 with $5.4 billion of work in hand, $600 million in cash and undrawn credit facilities and a robust pipeline of $8.8 billion, ensuring Perenti is well
positioned for the future.

We are, however, mindful that COVID-19 remains and will persist throughout FY '21. The structures we have put in place ensure we are well
positioned to withstand those challenges and navigate the issues as the situation continues to evolve. This includes the ongoing rotation of our
expatriate workforce as flights and border restrictions change in the countries we operate in. I'd like to profoundly thank all our people for their
commitment during these difficult and challenging times.

I'm joined with the Chairman in expressing my great sadness at the 2 devastating incidents, which took place during FY '20, the vicious terrorist
attack near the Boungou project in Burkina Faso in November 2019 and the fatal heavy vehicle incident at Obuasi in June 2020. My thoughts
continue to be with all employees impacted by these events and the families, friends and colleagues.

Safety is a paramount focus for me and the whole business, and nothing is more important to us than ensuring our people finish their work safely
every day. Our focus is on doing all that we can to protect our people, and this is reflected in our group health, safety and environment system.

Moving on to our business strategy. In March last year, we launched our 2025 Group strategy, and considerable progress was made in the year to
deliver against each of the 5 pillars of the strategy: operational excellence, strategic growth, organizational health, technology-driven future and
financial capacity. Today, I'll provide a few key examples of the initiatives achieved under each of those pillars.

Firstly, operational excellence. FY '20 represents the first full year of results for what is now Perenti, following the transformational acquisition of
Barminco and the 50% of African Underground Mining Services that we didn't already own. The strong result delivered by Perenti is built on the
exceptional performance and operational excellence of our underground business. It also demonstrates Perenti's ability to realize shareholder
value through an acquisition and positions us well for further M&A activity.

In addition to the positive Underground performance, our surface business in Africa, which has had some challenges during the year, delivered
improved financial performance during the second half of FY '20 compared to the first half despite challenges presented by COVID-19. Whilst
progress was made, the Surface business is still well down on our expectations, so a laser-like focus on improving this business continues into FY
'21. The strength of the Underground business and the improvement in our Surface business demonstrates the benefit of running a portfolio of
businesses.

For the second pillar, strategic growth. We consolidated our rebrand to Perenti that followed the Barminco acquisition in FY '19. Our strategic
growth has focused on building the presence and capabilities of our strong brands, targeting greater diversification of work to manage risk and
delivering more value and certainty to shareholders. In particular, our regional expansion initiative has focused on allocating capital and management
time towards attractive mining jurisdictions. There were some significant achievements in FY '20 in this area, which included the expansion of our
Underground business with the award of new contracts in Canada and Botswana. This expansion provides significant growth opportunities in
North America and Southern Africa with nearly 1/3 of our tender pipeline focused on these markets.

Organizational health is our third pillar, which is underpinned by investing in our people. A number of successful initiatives have been implemented
such as our frontline leadership training program that was delivered to 73 employees across Perenti during FY '20. Our ongoing commitment to
upskilling our employees for the long-term health of the group was recognized with Barminco being named Australia's Large Employer of the Year
at the National Australia Training Awards in 2019.

The group also has an excellent reputation in investing in the communities we work in. Since commencing operations in Africa nearly 30 years
ago, we have trained more than 25,000 Africans to be part of our business. A state-of-the-art training center was recently built by Barminco in
Botswana where we plan to train over 500 local people to be an integral part of our operations at the Zone 5 mine.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 As the Chairman mentioned, an important piece of work has been to define our commitment and approach to managing and delivering ESG-related
initiatives across the group. This is essential to achieve our aspiration to be the indispensable mining services company and to fulfill our purpose
of creating enduring value and certainty.

Technology is paramount to the future of mining, and we have made significant progress against our fourth strategic pillar, technology-driven
future. During the year, we completed what we believe to be a world first with Barminco successfully operating an underground loader from its
head office in Perth, working at a client's mine more than 750 kilometers away in the Goldfields region of Western Australia. In addition, Ausdrill
deployed a semi-autonomous smart surface drill rig and has plans to leverage the autonomous potential of the drill to improve safety and operational
performance more broadly.

Beyond the technology applied to our current business, we are developing a new technology service offering that we'll launch in calendar year
2021, so stay tuned.

The final pillar is financial capacity. The importance of a strong balance sheet was reinforced in the 2020 financial year where Perenti's focus on
capital discipline and liquidity management enabled the company to withstand the challenges presented by COVID-19. For example, in June 2020,
as a precautionary initiative, we secured additional debt funding on improved credit and covenant terms, further enhancing our strong liquidity
position. The additional funding was established to ensure Perenti is well positioned to withstand any ongoing economic challenges COVID-19
may present and provide the company with great flexibility to fund growth.

I'm also pleased to advise that in line with our recent announcement to the ASX, we have successfully priced USD 450 million offering of bonds,
which have a 5-year maturity, to institutional investors in United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. Upon financial settlement of the offer, which
is subject to customary closing conditions, we intend to fund the early redemption of Barminco's outstanding USD 350 million bonds and to apply
the net proceeds in partial repayment of amounts drawn, which are currently outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Looking ahead, our commitment is to build on the achievements delivered under our Group 2025 strategy by investing in our people and business
capabilities to ensure the company delivers on its growth potential. We've already seen early success in FY '21 with our underground business
securing $540 million in contract extensions for clients in Africa and Australia. These are early examples of securing contract extensions despite
the ongoing economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19.

Within our pipeline of $8.8 billion, there are a number of opportunities that, if secured, would see additional projects commence in the second half
of FY '21 with the full value of those opportunities realized in FY '22 and beyond. This includes targeting further work in high-quality mining
jurisdictions such as North America and Botswana as we seek to build upon our regional expansion achieved during FY '20.

The targeted pipeline opportunities in North America alone are $1.8 billion. These growth initiatives will build on our already strong order book
of $5.4 billion, of which $1.7 billion is secured for work in FY '21.

In closing, I'd like to reiterate my thanks to the executive team and our people for their resilience and commitment in the face of the challenges
presented in FY '20. I'd also like to extend my thanks to our clients and suppliers for their ongoing commitment.

Finally, I'd like to express my immense gratitude to our shareholders. We appreciate your loyalty during a volatile period. And I reaffirm my
commitment to deliver long-term growth and value for you, which is in line with our tagline of Expect More.

Thank you, and I'll now hand back to the Chairman.

 Mr. Mellis?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
My apologies, Chairman. Good morning, everybody. My name is Keith Mellis, and I'm a representative of the Australian Shareholders Association
who hold a number of proxies for shareholders today. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to start first by applauding the Board's decision to hold a hybrid -- a
AGM today, and the ASA would love to see this format continue into the future and thereby extend the opportunity for more shareholders to
participate in this annual event.

If I may, Mr. Chairman, I have 2 issues just on one document, and it's in respect of the year in review statement that's on Page 3 of the annual report.
It's in respect of the -- the first question is in respect to the earnings and net profit under -- both underlying results, earnings before interest, tax
and amortization of $212 million and the net PAT before amortization of $110 million, both underlying results, which don't take into account the
charge for amortization of acquired customer contracts.

My question, Mr. Chairman, and hopefully, it will help -- it would be helpful to shareholders to understand why the amortization of $38 million is
not considered to be a normal expense when the underlying revenue, the corresponding revenue is obviously regarded as normal.

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
All right. You have the advantage on me at the moment. I don't have the report in front of me. I'm going to ask our Chief Financial Officer, Peter
Bryant, to respond, if you will, Pete.

Peter John Bryant - Perenti Global Limited - Group CFO
Yes. Thank you, Ian. Yes, good question. The amortization of the client intangibles is a noncash item. We've excluded it from our underlying results
since the transaction to acquire Barminco. We do reconcile that back to our statutory result. But given it's a noncash expense attributable to an
intangible, we think the best way to present the results is to exclude it. So we have excluded it, as I said, but we do reconcile it and very transparent
on how we do that.

Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
Mr. Chairman, if I may respond, the only issue I have there is, well, depreciation isn't a cash item, but that is a normal charge and has been allowed
for. And the reason we're bringing this up is only because it's such a substantial amount, $38 million and $110 million. And I thought it would be
helpful if shareholders can understand why it's not included in those figures. It would be correct to say the underlying revenue is included in the
normal earnings and net profit.

Peter John Bryant - Perenti Global Limited - Group CFO
The revenue generated from the contracts that were acquired at the time of the acquisition, yes, they are included in the earnings. Depreciation,
I think, is slightly different as it relates to a cash outflow to purchase the assets that we then depreciate. And I think if we go back to how the
intangible was created and look at the general entries at that stage, they really flowed through equity, not through the P&L, per se. It gets into
some complex accounting that I am happy to sit and talk to you one on one after this, perhaps.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Thank you, Mr. Mellis.

Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
The second issue is regarding the same highlights, and it's regarding the return on average capital employed, which is stated at 16.6%. My
understanding that the capital employed formula is customized within house, we believe it would be helpful if on first seeing those highlights that
shareholders understand what the formula is presenting. For example, I calculated that based on underlying profit, if we took the normal definition
of return on average capital, the return would be more like 10% as opposed to 16.6%. I guess I would request that in future, when we present those
sort of figures, like return, that, that formula is put there, attached to it so that shareholders can understand why it's quite different to the normal
definition application.

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Thank you. I think when -- it's fair to say that we met with you before this meeting, and this was an issue which we discussed during the course of
that meeting. And my recollection is that we pointed out to you that the calculation is one which we have defined ourselves and that, that reference
was made that, as I recall it, within the annual report. But I think the fact that you're continuing to raise it indicates to me that, perhaps, we need
to do that more clearly. So we will take your comment on board, and we will address it as best we can in the forthcoming period.

Any other questions? Adrian, in the course of that discussion, has anything come through online?
PRESENTATION
Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Okay. As there are no further questions, then we'll now move to the next item of business.

Under the Corporations Act, listed companies are required to include, as part of their directors' report, a remuneration report, which includes
specified information. The directors have prepared a remuneration report to 30 June 2020, and it is included in the annual report on Pages 52 to
65. The Act also requires companies to put to shareholders a resolution that the remuneration report be adopted. I, therefore, move that the
remuneration report of the company for the financial year ended 30 June 2020 be adopted.

Under the Corporations Act, the vote is advisory only and does not bind the directors or the company. Voting exclusions apply to this resolution
as described in the notice of meeting. The proxy votes received in relation to this resolution are displayed on the screen. Any open and usable
proxies held by me as chair of the meeting will be voted in favor of the resolution.

Are there any comments or discussion? Mr. Mellis?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, the remuneration report includes the award of short-term incentives to 4 key management personnel and
retention and sign-on benefits to 2 KMPs. A profit gateway has not been applied before the calculation of all STIs, which wasn't the stated policy
in the annual report in 2019, which clearly referred to a financial gateway, which was introduced to ensure an acceptable level of company
performance before the award of any STI.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 The 2020 STIs include material amounts relating to nonfinancial hurdles. The ASA response, Mr. Chairman, it doesn't support the payment of
incentives generally not based on performance. It also does not support the payment of STIs where a financial gateway has not been applied to
nonfinancial hurdles. And thirdly and lastly, the ASA does not consider the payment of an STI is in line with the performance experienced by
shareholders with a negative return of 33%. For these reasons, the ASA will vote their proxies against resolution 1.

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Thank you, Mr. Mellis. Are you making a statement or do you want me to respond to that more than I have done to you in our earlier meetings?

Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
I'm making a statement to share -- with shareholders, Mr. Chairman.

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Okay.

Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
Perhaps this...

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
I'm actually happy to respond to it in the sense that if others have similar concerns, I'd like to perhaps share my thoughts on it with you.

Clearly, with a short-term incentive scheme, and clearly, in these times, the easy way out for a Board is simply to apply it entirely according to the
rules as you might perceive them. You say that there was a profit gateway. That is true, and that applied to 60% of the STI. We applied that profit
gateway in relation to 50% of the STI, and none of that was awarded. However, we did exercise the discretion in relation to cash conversion where,
as I said in my address earlier, the 96% that was achieved by the team was outstanding and, we thought, largely important in times of need during
COVID-19.

The challenge for us as a Board was the fact, firstly, that we thought our people did a fantastic job in dealing with not just the Boungou incident
but also COVID-19 as a crisis. Both of those incidents had the capacity to severely damage our business and to have a serious impact on the value
of our shares. All of us shareholders face the risk of that substantial damage. We believe the way in which our management team responded to
those crises was outstanding, as I said in my address, and that it deserved a reward. So our challenge was to find a way to address that.

I should also mention that we operate in an environment at present due largely in -- to COVID-19 but also the success of us, as I stated, with our
mining services and our mining operations that there is severe competition for our people. Now we've talked about, at different times, the pride
which we have in that team. I'm very proud of the team that Mark has pulled together. And I believe, and our Board believes, that it's vitally important
to shareholders that we keep that team in place in order to deliver up on the strategies which we are putting in place for the business leading
through to 2025.

So for that reason as well as wanting to reward the performance, we, as we've said in our address and as we've said in our releases, thought it
appropriate to not apply that financial gateway in relation to cash conversion. And we, in fact, are removing that going forward into the 2021 year
as a gateway.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The last issue you touched on was the nonfinancial hurdles, which require us -- or Mark in the first place and then us as a Board to make judgments
which are not measured in objective financial terms. And frankly, that's part of our job. That's what you pay us for. It's to make those judgments in
order to do the right thing and retain a team at an expense which is bearable in order to deliver up ultimately better benefits for shareholders.

So that's why we've done what we've done. I appreciate that people have exercised their right to show their displeasure in some respects. I had
hoped that the fact that we gave those explanations might assist people to change that, and I'm gratified to say that I think it has reflected in that
in the sense that 81.6% of our shareholders have agreed with us. So thank you for your comments.

Any other comments on the issue? Have we received any comments online?

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Keith Mellis;Australian Shareholders Association
Who else, Mr. Chairman? A brief comment, if I may, and I won't repeat anything that I commented on under resolution 1. But regarding STIs, it
follows therefore the ASA will vote its proxies against resolution 6 in that the performance rights are just a component of the STI that we didn't
support.

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
I understand your position. Thanks, Mr. Mellis. Have we anyone else with questions or comments? Anything online? No?

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Unidentified Participant
There are two questions, Mr. Chairman. The first is from [Mr. Todd Cole]. ""I wish to ask about the diversification strategy of the business and specifically
increasing the work in North America. Can you please elaborate on the current strategy?""

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Diversification strategy in the sense of jurisdictional expansion, I take it, is what they're on about. Mark, it might be perhaps better for you at an
operational level to describe that strategy.

Mark Alexander John Norwell - Perenti Global Limited - Group MD, CEO & Director
Yes. Happy to, Ian. So I guess in terms of our 2025 strategy, and we have called this out, specifically around our strategic growth, and that is
diversification into different geographies, and specifically, over the last 12 to 18 months, we've secured contracts in Canada and also Botswana,
jurisdictions that we see as positive mining environments with a long-term potential.

Specifically to the question that relates to North America, we secured the contract in Canada for Barminco, with the Hemlo project with Barrick.
That commenced in July of this calendar year. And the objective for us, linked to our strategy, is to continue to grow our business in North America
on the back of the Hemlo project.

The pipeline for North America that we've called out is $1.8 billion. The size of the mining market in North America is far larger than that. So we've
been quite selective in terms of that pipeline. And there's approximately 10 projects that fit into that $1.8 billion, approximately $200 million each,
or there or thereabouts.

So our plan is to continue to expand in North America on the back of Hemlo. By the end of this calendar year, we'd be looking to have people on
the ground based in the U.S. to get on-ground experience and knowledge and tender projects in the U.S. moving forwards.

So it is a clear, strategic priority of the business to expand into North America, and we see it as a very positive jurisdiction to deliver value to
shareholders in the long term.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Thanks, Mark. The second question.

Unidentified Participant
Second question, Mr. Chairman, is from [Mr. Graham Sasi Ole]. ""I've heard that some other large mining companies are starting to utilize voice
technology to enable worker safety and increase efficiency. As a shareholder, I'm curious to know whether Perenti is utilizing voice technology in
the safety space to gain efficiencies.""

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Thanks. I think I can say, and I'll leave it to Mark or Ben, perhaps, to correct me, but at present, the answer is no, but we're monitoring very closely
the progress which has been made in this area. I'm aware that meetings have already taken place between our people and people who provide
that technology.

And also, I should just reemphasize what Mark said in his address that safety is a major focus for us. And to the extent that this technology will
assist us to deliver better results on that front, you can be sure that we'll be monitoring it and taking it on board if it's appropriate.

Any other questions?

Unidentified Participant
Mr. Chairman, we've received one question online from [Mr. Bryan Bender]. ""Is it the Board's intention to maintain dividends?""

Ian Howard Cochrane - Perenti Global Limited - Non-Executive Chairman
Yes. In a word, yes. There is -- just if I may anticipate an issue going forward at the level of franking credits, which we will need to address or be
aware of because the last dividend -- or the dividend we will pay will exhaust our currently available franking credits. But yes, certainly, it would
be our intention to do that, all things being equal.

Anything else? No? All right. Well, thank you, everyone. Nothing else here. As mentioned earlier, the results of the poll will be available shortly and
will be announced via the ASX platform. For those who have attended in person, thank you for your attendance and interest. To the shareholders
and visitors participating online, we are pleased that our technology enabled your attendance today, and we also thank you for joining us remotely.
We look forward to your continued support in the coming year.

That ends the meeting, which I'll now declare closed. And for those of you here today, please join us for some light refreshments. Thank you very
much.

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Marianella, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before we delve into the progress and results of Q2, I want to take this opportunity
to provide a personal account of the year-to-date as this is the first full quarter that I'm reporting on as CEO. Shortly after being appointed CEO, I
                                                                                                                                                                             
 set out a plan around 3 key priorities for the company: to establish a clear vision and corporate structure, to drive the business integration and to
execute our commercial strategy and plan. It is these priorities that have laid the foundation for not only Q2 but for the rest of 2020 and beyond.

The strategic shift from bulk or wholesale B2B sales to becoming a consumer-focused packaged goods company has been at the core of not only
our operational transformation but also our corporate mindset. This is being evident in our sales mix, our customer and stakeholder engagements
as well as the overhaul of some of our operational infrastructure. As such, we continue to drive the business integration of WeedMD and Starseed
operations. We successfully consolidated our medical channel into a single platform. We reintroduced our Color brand and expanded the product
line with new strains, launched new product formats, significantly upsized our cultivation, consolidated operations to realize greater economies
of scale, introduced automation in both labeling and packaging to drive our efficiency and speed to market, concentrated on bringing down our
SG&A, signed additional union groups and benefit insurance providers and that's just to name a few items.

A critical step in riding the shift has been the continued effort to clean up the balance sheet we inherited by paying down over $12 million in
payables since the beginning of the year as well as identifying and writing down, trimming old inventory from previous years. It is through decisions
like these that we have managed to unencumber ourselves and continue to find efficiencies through consolidated activities and removing
duplication.

At the end of the day, our success ultimately speaks to our people and their ability to drive to execute the commercial plan. We have assembled
the best leadership team in the industry, and our employees' passion and engagement is clearly evident in the energized cultivation, processing
and packaging teams as well as a bolstered sales and marketing team.

Notwithstanding these great accomplishments in the first half of the year, our second quarter results were not immune to the effects of COVID-19.
Our inability to conduct our live education and activation initiatives with our union and insurance partners and their respective members resulted
in a flattening of new patient registrations and softening of medical sales. Our combined second quarter net revenues of $5.9 million also reflects
some of the changes in consumer-buying behaviors, which saw a load-in of sales in late March and much of April, which ultimately included a
reduction of in-store purchases as well as reduced consumption of some retail formats such as pre-rolls.

For the 6 months ended June 30, we recorded net sales of $18 million compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2019. The 6-month revenue
increase in 2020 year-over-year was mainly due to the full period of contribution of Starseed, the growth we've continued to experience in adult-use
market and, of course, the substantial sale of outdoor biomass to an international license holder at the beginning of the year.

Despite COVID-19 headwinds to our business, we are encouraged by the level of consumer activity and sharp, upward movement we are currently
seeing throughout our operations. Since late June, net sales have continued to climb back to pre-pandemic levels as the overall industry has
rebounded, and we are confident in our ability to grow near-term revenue as we continue to drive towards profitability. Starting in the second half
of 2020, we have seen an uptick in customer activity, both from our direct and consumer and patient sales channels.

We are on the path to profitability as is evident by our steady improvement in gross margin performance quarter-over-quarter. The increased
harvest as a result of our greenhouses being fully operational delivered cost per gram from postharvest of $0.55 in Q2 compared to $0.96 in the
comparable period for 2019. Coupled with the continued effort to introduce and drive efficiencies to streamline activities like the introduction of
automation and some improvements in packaging, we feel we're in a strong position to drive through the rest of the year. We are now harvesting
product in 17 rooms in our greenhouse. It's truly impressive, taking into account that 10 of these rooms were just brought online in the latter
months of 2019. To note, WeedMD is currently producing the most quality, cultivated cannabis that the company has ever produced in a single
period. Importantly, we significantly increased our capacity in 2020 without sacrificing our product quality.

We also began our second season of outdoor cultivation, which we anticipate to have an impressive harvest over the coming weeks. By building
on our experiences from last year's harvest, we achieved even greater progress to date and are well on track to harvesting a crop that is looking
exceptionally promising. I'm very pleased with what we've been able to achieve and want to personally thank our seasoned cultivation team for
all their hard work and dedication in bringing this season to fruition. Importantly, we remain disciplined in controlling expenses and reducing our
SG&A by $1.7 million as a result of ongoing integration and other operational efficiencies. Lincoln will provide additional details on our second
quarter financial performance shortly.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Over the past few weeks, we've shared a stream of steady news, which I encourage you to read at your convenience. But to highlight some of those,
we announced the expansion of our product offerings across all channels with our Cannabis 2.0 lineup of vapes, topicals and gels, including key
strategic partnerships with Mary's Medicinals and Fire & Flower. We secured an amendment to our Strathroy sales license to include the production
and sale of all cannabis formats from the site. Our adult-use brand, Color Cannabis, introduced a new cultivar, Black Sugar Rose. We merged our
WeedMD and Starseed medicinal channels under one streamlined platform. And most recently, we secured $30 million of nondilutive financing
from our strategic partner, the LiUNA Pension Fund. This financing comes at an inflection point in our development as it provides important working
capital to drive sales and marketing initiatives for both our medical and adult-use brands, especially as we look to add more distribution channels
for greater market penetration as the retail segment doubles in size over the coming year.

I want to thank the LiUNA leadership and the pension fund for their continued support on our shared strategic and commercial vision. Their
investment underscores their dedication to delivering medical cannabis as a safe alternative to opioids as well as the commercial value we see in
both our adult-use and medical service offering.

In summary, despite some challenging operational conditions in Q2, we continued to make significant progress, we remain focused on executing
against our vision and we are well positioned for continued growth.

This concludes my opening remarks, and I will now hand the call over to Lincoln, our CFO, who will review our financial results. Lincoln?

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
Thank you, Angelo, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll briefly review the second quarter 2020 financial highlights as Angelo has already
mentioned second quarter corporate highlights.

We reported net revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 of $5.9 million compared to $8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. As a
percentage of revenue, direct to consumer accounted for $2.6 million or 45%, and wholesale accounted for $3.3 million or 55%. For the 6 months
ended June 30, 2020, net revenue was $18 million compared to $11.3 million in the comparable 2019 period. The 6-month increase was mainly
attributable to the full period contribution of Starseed, growth in adult-use market and a significant sale of dried cannabis to a license holder in
the beginning of 2020.

The second quarter 2020 gross loss before changes in fair value was $0.9 million, a 15% gross loss compared to an 11% gross margin in the previous
quarter and 46% in the prior year. The 15% negative margin was primarily due to $3.9 million of noncash items, which included a $1.4 million
impairment charge on inventory taken during the quarter and steps taken to automate and optimize operations at the Aylmer, Strathroy and
Bowmanville facilities. As we fully ramp up, driving towards the end of the year, we expect to see improvements in our costs at various stages along
the value chain.

Now I'd like to provide some greater context into our gross margin results. Looking at our gross margin before changes in fair value and noncash
items, the result reflected a [65%] gross margin versus the negative 15% reported, demonstrating our continued efforts to streamline and gain
efficiencies along the value chain as well as acknowledging the cash and noncash impacts of our cost of goods sold.

In addition, I'd like to offer some additional clarity on the inventory write-off. In the first half of the year, we conducted an inventory assessment,
which is customary in our industry. After assessing the inventory that was carried over from previous years, we elected to take an inventory
write-down in the quarter in accordance with WeedMD's production and quality standards on the salable product.

In the second quarter of 2020, WeedMD's weighted average cost of sales per gram, inclusive of all costs, direct and indirect, to produce and package,
was $2.52 compared to $1.84 in the second quarter 2019. We have cultivation cost per gram for $0.55 per gram for the quarter compared to $0.96
during the same period in 2019. This improvement is a direct result of economies of scale as we have increased our capacity and efficiency, including
the initiatives taken at each of our Aylmer, Strathroy and Bowmanville sites that I mentioned earlier. We expect this improvement to continue
throughout the second half of 2020 within our greenhouse and outdoor growth activities.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Bringing down our payables that accumulated prior to Starseed and WeedMD integration has been one of our key objectives. In fact, we've paid
over $12 million in payables during the 6-month period ended June 30, 2020. We also realized operational efficiencies in our cultivation, which is
now fully ramped. We continue to optimize our sites and, most critically, began executing on automation, which is yet to be initialized at that point.
We maintain that the growth expectation for the Canadian cannabis market and WeedMD will continue to improve as we move into the second
half of 2020 and beyond.

General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $4.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared to $4.4 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2019, and down from $6.4 million in the previous quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the acquisition
of Starseed in December 2019 and the company's overall growth, mainly resulting in increases in values and benefits. However, as noted, we are
seeing improvements quarter-over-quarter, resulting from a conscious effort to reduce [overall overhead].

Adjusted EBITDA loss totaled $5.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, as compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the same period in 2019,
mainly driven by the impairment charge of inventory during the quarter that I mentioned earlier, substantial expenses incurred related to increases
in production and selling and general and administrative expenses prior to optimization initiatives as we reduce these costs in the second half of
2020. Please note, adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement in the IFRS. And with that, it may not be comparable to that as presented by
other companies. Management believes adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the company's day-to-day operations that excluded interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, fair value changes and other noncash items and nonrecurring items. This measurement
is useful in assessing the results of operating and strategic decisions.

Net loss and comparative loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, was $8.9 million compared with income of $12.6 million for the same period in
the prior year. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily a result of increased operating costs in relation to the production ramp-up and
expansion of the cultivation facilities, the impairment charge on inventory that was included in cost of sales and the realized fair value adjustments
on inventory sold.

As for our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.7 million. Total assets as of June 30, 2020, reached $203.7
million, including inventory and biological assets of $38.6 million compared to approximately $29.4 million during the same period last year.

As previously discussed -- disclosed, in June, we amended certain terms of our senior secured credit facility entered into on March 29, 2019. Under
the terms of the credit agreement amendment, we secured a deferral of certain financial covenants by 12 months to June 30, 2021, and quarterly
principal repayments are rescheduled to commence at the end of 2020. Additionally, the company agreed to a 50 basis points increase in the
applicable interest rate margin on credit facility. This amendment to our credit facility will provide us greater financial flexibility to support our
continued commercial growth and our expanded distribution channel.

And more recently, as Angelo mentioned today, we entered into a $30 million credit facility with LiUNA Pension Fund. This nondilutive financing
matures in June 2022 and provides the company with a financial flexibility to drive WeedMD's commercial initiatives, in the next stage of growth.
For further information on our financial and operating performance, I encourage you to review the company's financial statements and management's
discussion and analysis for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, which have been filed and are available through SEDAR.

Before turning the call back over to Angelo, I'd like to talk about the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, how it has impacted our business
and our expectations going forward. Throughout this pandemic, WeedMD has continued to conduct its operation to the fullest extent possible
while continuing to take actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, suppliers and customers. During the first quarter of 2020, the
coronavirus did not have a material impact on our business. As we progressed to the second quarter, we experienced a decline in sales relative to
the first quarter, which, in part, can be attributable to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

Towards the end of the second quarter and early in the third quarter, we began to see increasing customer activity in the majority of our markets,
reflecting the reopening of the Canadian economy and the steadily decreasing impact of COVID-19. This positive momentum has continued
throughout the third quarter to date, including increased sales since the onset of the pandemic. While we remain optimistic that operating conditions
will continue to improve, we will remain prudent and continue to be disciplined in controlling our expenses. We intend to continue improving our
operating efficiencies, which will enable us to deliver improved margins and meet increasing consumer demand as the market for Cannabis 2.0

                                                                                                                                                                             
 products continue to develop. Additionally, the $30 million credit facility from the LPF will provide us increased financial flexibility as we continue
to expand our distribution, banner and brand awareness, which should drive further revenue growth.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Angelo for closing remarks.

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Thanks, Lincoln. In conclusion, we are very excited about our prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond. We accomplished a great deal
during the first half of 2020 and are proud of what we've already achieved. Importantly, we have laid the groundwork for our continued success
moving forward even as we face some challenges and fix some difficult steps along the way. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on
driving increased revenues and gross margins, expanding our product offerings in both traditional and Cannabis 2.0 formats and leveraging our
strategic Starseed platform to drive organic growth across all our medical channels, optimizing our Color and Saturday cannabis brand presence
and further growth in the adult-use sales, forming new commercial partnerships to generate incremental revenues and exploring new ways to
enhance our customers' overall experience.

My team and I want to thank our employees and shareholders for their continued confidence, patience and support and we look forward to updating
everyone at our Q3 earnings call. Now we're happy to take your questions.

Marianella delaBarrera - WeedMD Inc. - VP of Communications & Corporate Affairs
Thank you, Angelo. This concludes our opening remarks and we're now ready for the question period. Ariel, please proceed with the instructions

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first analyst is Neal Gilmer of Haywood Securities.

Neal Gilmer - Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations
Yes. Maybe I wanted to start, Angelo, on some of your prepared remarks. I'm just trying to make sure I understand or the takeaway is accurate. You
commented just that you're sort of seeing sales now above the pre-COVID-19 levels. So I assume that's sort of what you're sort of seeing most
recently perhaps in the month of September. But for Q3, I'm trying to get a feel for whether we're expecting growth off of the Q1 level or growth
off of Q2 but still -- maybe still not quite back to where we saw. And when I refer to Q1, I'm excluding that, obviously, that wholesale payment and
more looking at sort of the direct-to-patient and the wholesale into the provinces. So any sort of further color you can provide on sort of what
those sales levels you've seen recently are.

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Sure. And thanks for your question, Neal. Hope you're well. Definitely. And obviously, without trying to provide any sense of formal guidance, the
remarks are really about coming back to monthly run rate that we were seeing really going into March. We really -- as you recall, coming into this
late January and early February, we really had that focus around turning around not just our medical sales but reintroducing that Color brand. And
so we were really starting to see that ramp up. Obviously, close to the end of March, once the pandemic hit and things became a little more serious,
we saw that pulling forward at stockpiling, if you will, of -- in all industries, not just cannabis.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We -- there are some seasonality to -- for our medical business, but more importantly, what -- that, coupled with COVID, I think what we're starting
to see now is sort of mid-August and really in the latter part, September, in particular, we're really starting to see that rebound back to what I would
say the Q1 run rate that we were seeing. So feeling quite positive about where things will net out. We haven't obviously calculated Q3 yet. But
when I think about our results, we're probably closer to a jump-off point of Q1 than Q2.

Neal Gilmer - Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations
Okay. Appreciate that. And then can you provide a little bit more color on the medical side? Like if you go back -- obviously, I guess your -- when
the transaction with Starseed closed, let's call it, towards the beginning of this year, and I guess the philosophy there was as far as the ability to
grow that medical side through some of those agreements, is there any sort of anecdotal comments you can provide as far as how that's progressing,
I guess, maybe again post sort of the main disruption in Q2?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes, happy to. I mean just to reiterate, you -- our model is quite unique, right? They are signed partnerships and arrangements with unions, employers,
and it's really all about that cannabis as a paid benefit, quite frankly. The significant driver of our business is obviously patient registrations, and a
lot of that had to do with our ability to be there in person, in activations and really around driving awareness through education. Obviously, with
social distancing, that's significantly flattened.

The other piece is we had a number of new partnerships that were lined up that we were prepared and hoping that we'd be announcing in Q2.
Obviously, financial prudence during a global pandemic is something that has slowed some of those, what I call, B2B discussions. And we're
optimistic that we might see some of that materialize in the latter half of the year or it may actually get pushed out to 2021. We'll see what that
looks like. But there is inherent seasonality in some of that medical business, and we tend to see a bit of a flattening during the summer months.
That, coupled with the pandemic, is kind of where we saw that compounding effect. But I'm, again, quite positive and quite optimistic, just given
the most recent month and the last number of weeks, that we are starting to climb back into that regular run rate and growth rate that we were
experiencing.

Neal Gilmer - Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations
Okay. And then I didn't quite hear clearly one or two of Lincoln's comments on the gross margin. So I just want to make sure I have my takeaway
here. I thought you said -- I believe you said $3.9 million total noncash charges and that included a $1.4 million impairment. And I think you
mentioned what -- if you normalize, if you exclude some of those onetime items, what would your normalized gross margin have been for the
quarter?

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
Yes. It's Lincoln. That's correct. I thought it would be important to provide a bit of color on our cost of sales and certainly our gross margin because
we did absolutely have [$2.9 million] of noncash items. And when you back that out, you get a 50 -- actually 52% gross margin.

Neal Gilmer - Haywood Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst of Special Situations
Okay. Yes. That is helpful. And then sort of you took that impairment on the inventory. And obviously, you still have, whatever, you have $35 million
in the inventory and some more biological assets. But do you feel now that there is, at this current time, I guess, and I understand how the market
can always change, but you're not expecting further impairments? Do you sort of feel like you're comfortable with what you've done with that
impairment?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
Well, the way it was is that you have to look at the assessment that has to be done on a periodic basis. Certainly, from our standpoint, we believe
that the inventory that is currently on our balance sheet is what will be sold. And we were doing everything in our power to ensure that we have
the sales team hitting the road and working through all our -- the markets to sell every single product that we have. So that's basically our way of
doing that at this point.

Operator
Our next question comes from Patrick Sullivan of Eight Capital.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
I know -- understand the headwinds experienced in Q2. I definitely see it not only in WeedMD's results but other companies as well. I was wondering
if you guys -- do you guys have any sense on where your market share was in the context of Q2? Was that -- were you still able to grow it? Or was
it in line with Q1 or anything you can offer in that regard?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
We have some insights, and maybe I'll turn it over to Stephen to...

Stephen Ng - WeedMD Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Yes. Pat, I think it varies by -- province by province. So just to give you a sense, I think our market share was probably relatively flat, I would say, in
some of the key provinces that we're in.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Great. And then I guess just for -- in terms of ramping things up, and you guys had some press releases about kind of 2.0 products and
launches. When likely do you expect that stuff to really hit the income statement? Like when were orders taken out or when were things shipping?
And will it be meaningful in the next quarter?

Stephen Ng - WeedMD Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Yes. Fourth quarter will be the quarter when you'll see -- when we'll see that revenue hit our P&L.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Awesome. And then we're starting to hear more and more about the outdoor crops and getting the harvest and stuff like that. I wonder how
are buyers assessing the quality of the outdoor products? Because it sounds like there's going to be a bit -- quite a bit hitting the market. And I'm
not sure exactly how people are being assessed, I guess, on quality. So is it just THC content at this point? Or are there other metrics that people
are looking at?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes. I'm happy to kind of at least give initial thoughts, and Stephen, feel free to jump in if there's anything I leave out. Typically, we were actually
quite happy with the way we're able to commercialize some of our product last year. We actually found some of our outdoor being used in our
finished goods and not just necessarily moving into extraction as most might think. The challenge, obviously, is with outdoor, there are a number
of risks, and it's difficult to truly plan on what those product formats could be. We have, obviously, our pre-roll formats. We have our ready to roll,
and we were quite happy with the cannabinoid content and terpene profiles that we had last year, and we think this year should be just as good,
if not better. So we'll -- fingers crossed. I mean, at the end of the day, we are in the final stages right now. And as we mentioned, things are looking
quite good.

The challenge is all the various materials that we would also find in those products, right? And so for the most part, we don't plan on being able
to sell dry bud, for example, as from the outdoor, just because of the variability of the product. Now some of it is looking quite good, and it might
be possible. But for the most part, you're right. There is a lot of biomass that is -- looks like it's coming online, and I guess it really will come down
to the overall quality because, as you know, cannabinoid content and THC levels continue to be the primary drivers. And failing that, you end up
having just a lot of input material otherwise, and so I think that would be the key. I think we're feeling good about where we're at.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Great. So just to be clear, it sounds like that the dry flower is going to be directed to mostly extracted products as the end product, not sold
as dried product, dried bud?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
No. We will do both. We will have pre-rolls and our ready-to-roll formats, absolutely. It's just it won't be sold, as I said, whole bud. And then...

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Oh, won't be sold as whole bud.

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Yes, yes.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Got it. And then one last one here for me, and I'll get back. Is there anything you guys can provide with respect to CapEx for the remainder of the
year? Is there some sort of a guidance on that?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I don't have official guidance, but we've been saying all along that our infrastructure is actually quite solid. We've -- we're in a very positive position
that, at best, it remains modest. There are some maintenance and slight improvements that we continue to make, but there is no material CapEx
that is required to fulfill and execute against our plan.

Our next question comes from Chris Damas of BCMI Research.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Chris Damas - BCMI Research - Principal & Analyst
If you multiply the grams by the volumes, you get $4.84 million in sales, but there's $5.8 million. Where is the other $1 million in revs? Is that
something else?

Stephen Ng - WeedMD Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Chris, the difference is extracts. The kilos that were reported were sales of dried flower.

Chris Damas - BCMI Research - Principal & Analyst
Okay. So you don't do an equivalency in reporting extracts?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
No. We don't.

Chris Damas - BCMI Research - Principal & Analyst
Would the extracts be in the medical area, you'd think?

Stephen Ng - WeedMD Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
Yes. It's primarily in the medical channel.

Chris Damas - BCMI Research - Principal & Analyst
Okay. Secondly, what was -- just for housekeeping purposes, what was the harvest during the quarter, obviously, from the greenhouse?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Lincoln, do you have that handy?

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
Just -- it was just over 6,000 kilos.

Chris Damas - BCMI Research - Principal & Analyst
Great. And lastly, the white label deal with Fire & Flower, do you have more retailers that you're working with? Or do you have to exclusively work
with Fire & Flower?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Stephen Ng - WeedMD Inc. - Chief Commercial Officer
The agreement with Fire & Flower was a great opportunity for us to work with a retailer. It is not exclusive. So we certainly have the ability to work
with other retailers and, frankly, any other partner around product and brand partnerships. So I think we've seen continued interest in that from
other groups, and we'll continue to assess those on an individual basis.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Greg McLeish of Mackie Research.

Greg McLeish - Mackie Research Capital Corporation, Research Division - Director & Analyst of Special Situations
Just a couple of questions. What do you think your cash breakeven is on revenue right now?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
I'll let Lincoln...

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
So Chris, what I could say is we're proceeding with our plan to become cash positive in 2021, and our plan remains that way. We don't provide
guidance specifically to our exact breakeven. But if you look at our numbers, I think it's in line with and reaching to that point. With the recent $30
million that we've received in financing, we believe that we have now -- we have the flexibility to execute on that plan.

Greg McLeish - Mackie Research Capital Corporation, Research Division - Director & Analyst of Special Situations
But it looks to me that of -- what would be a good sort of gross profit number? If I use 35%, 40%, you guys are going to have to generate at least
north of $60 million in order to be cash breakeven, if I'm not correct.

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
No. I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we could certainly -- we will certainly reach breakeven at a lower revenue number. And here's the reason
why. That's what we are currently thinking. Number one, obviously, to grow our top line and revenue, and we have invested in our sales team. But
also, and you will see that and we're committed to doing that, you'll see the reduction in costs continue to demonstrate it not just throughout the
value chain but on cultivation, all the way to packages. And ultimately, that's what will drive our breakeven number, right?

So the results now -- and I think I mentioned that previously, you need to strip out some of those accounting adjustments that continue to mask
the true performance. And when you strip that out, I think you will notice that we actually are or will get to a breakeven number at a lower revenue
number.

Greg McLeish - Mackie Research Capital Corporation, Research Division - Director & Analyst of Special Situations
Well, I guess my concern here is that you're continuing to burn through cash. You've got the new LiUNA credit line, which is -- given it's at 15%
interest rates, I mean that's $4.5 million per year. Now I know you can do a payment in kind, but what my concern is, is that you're going to absolutely
dilute the equity shareholders going forward because you've got a high debt position. And when the share price is where it is, it's hard to raise
equity at these levels. So what comfort can you give to the equity shareholders of the business that you can generate a long-term return for them?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
So I think I'll take that. And if Angelo or Stephen want to add some color, they can certainly do so afterwards. I'll reiterate that the comfort I give
certainly shareholders in terms of not diluting the interest is that we will become cash positive, and we will be able to service our debt. The plans
that we have in terms of automation, we'll continue to automate. We'll continue to look at all our costs and reduce. And I'm seeing the signs right
now as we go into, I guess, at Q4 now that we can reduce our costs significantly in order to -- continue to reach to that -- meet our plan. And that
plan is obviously to become a sustainable, profitable business.

So once again, it's something that you -- I believe firmly that we can do. We've seen the signs that it's happening. Certainly on the top line, we're
growing our revenue. And as I indicated before, you will see the -- our costs continue to come down, obviously, relatively to the increase in sales.

Operator
Our next question is a follow-up from Patrick Sullivan of Eight Capital.

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Yes. Just one last one for me. I was just wondering, I know the credit facility closed very recently, but has there been any draw on it, if you can share
that?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
Pardon me? Can you repeat the question, Pat?

Patrick Sullivan - Eight Capital, Research Division - Analyst
Sure. Have you guys drawn on the credit facility at this time?

Angelo Tsebelis - WeedMD Inc. - CEO, President & Director
No, no. We haven't.

Lincoln E. C. Greenidge - WeedMD Inc. - CFO
Sorry. Just to clarify, the structure of the debt is -- it's not structured as a revolver or an accordion, so it's a onetime bullet. So we are in receipt of
cash from the issuance of the debt.

I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.

PRESENTATION
Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, and welcome to Cavotec Investor meeting today. My name is Johan Hähnel, and I'm Cavotec's Investor
Relations Manager. And I'm truly honored to welcome you, be it in-person or remotely, as most of you are up here and looking at the camera right
now.

May I ask to please ask those who are in this room to turn off mobile phones if you have forgotten that. Here is our agenda for today, where our
CEO, Mikael Norin, will introduce Cavotec at the glance, the respective Presidents, Patrick Mares, Ports & Maritime; Juergen Strommer, Airports;
and Patrick Baudin, Services will go through a business update of Cavotec.

Our group CFO, Glenn Withers, will update us on the company performance after that. f

Then we will invite Mikael back on stage to talk about our investments for the future as well as ramp-up and conclusions. And as always, in these
meetings, it is the third meeting we have, investor meeting, we will finalize with the Q&A session. So with that, let me now introduce you to our
host here today, Mikael Norin.

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Thank you very much, Johan. Hi. Huge welcome to everyone in the room and also everyone on the web following that are following us right now.
We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to update you on Cavotec and talk to you about why we are so excited about the future of this
company.

Let me start with a short introduction to Cavotec. Cavotec has a long history in connection technology, whether it is connecting a port crane to
power or an aircraft to cooling or heating. In each of these areas that we operate in, we are incredibly well positioned when it comes to mega
trends, such as automation, environmental improvements and safety. It's our future focus, the possibility to work with what will be tomorrow
standards today that actually attracted me personally to Cavotec. And in Cavotec, we talk about us connecting the future. Now we strongly believe
that we can take an active part in contributing to a future world that is cleaner, safer and more efficient. In addition, of course, to being a successful
and profitable company.

Let me start with showing you a short video that gives you an overview of what we do.

(presentation)
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Now as you can see in the video, our activities are split into 2 end customer divisions: Ports & Maritime, and Airports & Industry. And then both of
those divisions are supported by a global services organization. Now you're going to hear from each of the business leaders in more detail later
about their offerings, and how we look at the markets that they serve. And you're going to see why, again, we are so excited about the future for
this company.

Now as I'm sure you have noticed, there's been unprecedented focus on sustainability recently, a focus that is also driving new legislation in many
of the markets and industries we operate in. These developments and the believes that we need to build a more sustainable world is also reflected
in the expectations of many investors that we talked to.

At the same time, looking from our customers' point of view, they are trying to operate in a profitable way in an increasingly competitive landscape.
So it's no longer a choice between either a green agenda or financial performance. Now increasingly, companies are turning to technology to try
to solve this dilemma, to maximize productivity, to become more competitive, but at the same time, improve safety and significantly reduce their
environmental impact. We believe that Cavotec is incredibly well positioned to take a center stage in this evolution, and that is what this day is all
about.

Let's have a look at how we translate this overall trend into a vision for each of our businesses. In Ports & Maritime, we believe the end state is a
fully autonomous maritime supply chain, where electrically power ships will be sailing, mooring, loading and unloading without human interaction.
The market is already taking steps towards that end state.

In Airports, we will be part of an evolution towards the fully automated airport, providing solution for airplanes to dock and be served at the gate
with no human interactions. On industry, we believe in the vision of the fully remotely controlled industrial site, where we provide connectivity
and control of battery-powered heavy-duty vehicles. Now actually, what is so cool about Cavotec is that we play an important role in this evolution
already today, and let me explain how that works.

Let's go on a trip together. It is a trip that involves international travel, but don't worry, it's all in the mind so no masks required. For our first stop,
we're going to go to Norway. Imagine a Norwegian field with a ferry, powered by batteries, emitting no noise, no pollution and automatically
docking and recharging without human interaction when at the key. Within minutes, they're ready to sail again.

Now this is the future today that we have made possible. For our next stop, imagine you're sitting in the departure lounge at Dubai airport. I'm
sure you're all missing sitting at the airports. And you're waiting for your next flight. Now what you will see is the plane being powered, cooled and
fueled from connections right under the plane, with no clutter of polluting and noisy mobile equipment. This is the future today that we have
made possible.

For our next scenario, let's turn to an industrial side. Imagine that you are in Chicago, and you're looking at a large construction site where heavy-duty
cement truck is pumping concrete under high pressure, with the operator remotely backing in that large truck inside the dangerous zone, but
safely starting the pumping while standing at a distance, overlooking the operation. Again, this is the future today that we have made possible.

Now what these examples have in common is that we have helped those customers do more with less, while protecting their people and equipment
and reducing their environmental impact. We say that we have delivered profitable sustainability for our customers.

Let's hear in more detail about our profitable sustainability ambitions for each of our businesses, starting with Ports & Maritime. Patrick?

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
Thank you, Mikael. I'm actually very excited for the opportunity to share with you where we're going with the Ports & Maritime business. So let's
start with a video.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 (presentation)

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
At Ports & Maritime, we are developing, manufacturing and implementing innovative automation and rectification technologies for the global
Ports & Maritime markets. We're offering solutions to our customers to make their operations more efficient, reliable, safe and sustainable. We do
not just provide a product, but a complete solution, including support over the full life cycle. And we're always trying to find a better way for
customers, understanding that for them, every minute matters.

In this picture, you can see MoorMaster installation. It's our automated mooring solution that we invented to moor and release a vessel within 30
seconds, saving time in a safe way. This is sustainable profitability. We offer our customers systems and solutions basically divide in 4 market
segments to help them achieving profitable sustainability by: reducing moor in time and improving worker safety with our automatic mooring,
the MoorMaster; by reducing vessel emission with our Shore Power offering, both on the ship side and on the shore side; by enabling electrical
vessels by providing fully automated charging; and by supporting ports and reducing pollution by providing electrical power to their cranes and
e-trucks.

So I'm now going to dive a little bit deeper in each of those segments. So let's start with automated mooring by hearing directly from an end user.

(presentation)

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
The underlying business logic in maritime automation is to lower operational expenses while also achieving a safer and greener footprint. So let
me tell you how that works for MoorMaster. This first graph illustrates a typical port is by a large passenger vessel to a port not equipped with our
MoorMaster. The conventional way to manually moor a ship of this size will normally take about 10 minutes. Then it will spend about 45 minutes
off loading and loading before another 5 minutes that are spent to release the vessel so they can sail again.

Now using our MoorMaster, the vessel is instead moored in only some 30 seconds and released in 15 seconds. This means that a ship can leave the
port 15 minutes earlier and therefore sail slower to its next port. This so-called slow steaming reduces fuel consumption. It also means that a vessel
can shut down its engine sooner after arriving at the ports and thereby, drastically reducing pollution and noise in the ports. A ports, by the way,
which is often situated in or close to a city, just like here in Stockholm.

Now an alternative use of that same vessel and same safe time is for the port to offload and load more gifts and vehicles and thereby, generating
more revenue through improved productivity. Now if this ship, in this example, was electrical, it also mean longer charging time and therefore,
using small batteries and having lower initial investments for the operator. Now if this would have been a containership calling on a large cargo
ports, the time saving would even be higher. In that case, conventional mooring will take more than an hour, and the saving will be close to 1 hour
for each mooring. And that time can be used to unload and load more containers as well as turning off the heavy diesel burning engine sooner.

Now while the business case is different for each port, saving time will lead to significant fuel savings. That's a fact, and this is the most tangible
benefit of a MoorMaster system. At the bottom line, the fuel savings through slow steaming, less waiting time in the port in itself pays for the
MoorMaster system. However, the environmental benefits have not gone unnoticed by the market, saving time and fuel saves the environment.
And a great example is the port of Helsinki. They first installed a MoorMaster system in 2017 and then ordered a second system in 2019. And the
port has a stated objective of carbon neutrality and sees the introduction of automated mooring as an important step in their efforts to reduce
pollution. This is the future today that we have made possible.

Now then what does it mean for automated mooring market development? Initially, MoorMaster was only installed in niche segments where the
customer had an operational limitation where conventional mooring impacted the performance of its ports. In the second step, we now see
automated mooring becomes the market standard for high-frequency ferries that see a lot of benefit from the system as well as addressing the

                                                                                                                                                                             
 environmental concerns. So while the ferry market will continue to grow, we also expect high utilization and greenfield container thermals will be
the next to follow.

At Cavotec, we believe that each minute will matter more and more and that automated mooring will have a given role in each port of the world
in the future.

Now let's move to Shore Power next.

(presentation)

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
What you saw here, this is something we're very proud of, and where we feel we're really contributing to a cleaner, safer and more efficient world
today. So do you know that Cavotec owns many world records when it comes to Shore Power systems? Starting with the first cable management
system delivered here in Stockholm in 1985, followed by the world's first on-ship system in 2004 to Evergreen and the world's first onshore equipment
in 2007 to the Port of Long Beach. We also delivered the first containerized solution for retrofitting ships for Shore Power to Hyundai Merchant
Marine in 2014. We have today the most broadest product range in the markets. They're able to actually cover all kinds of applications with 35
years of experience and continuous customer-led innovation. We have positioned us as a leader in the Shore Power markets.

Unpacking the benefits of Shore Power, let's start with the environmental and health aspect. And as an example, our Shore Power installation at
the Port of Long Beach in California is estimated by the port to have significantly reduced the risk of cancer among people living nearby. Next, for
the operations of the port, our system provides increased efficiency and lower operational costs for connecting and disconnecting reliable power
supply to the vessels. And finally, the minimized footprint of our systems makes it easy to build retrofit in existing vessel with a plug and play
approach as well as optimizing installations on new vessels. This is the future today that we have made possible.

Now the Shore Power market is driven by a global ambition to reduce pollution, and it's triggered by new government regulations, forcing fleets
and ports to adapt Shore Power. We believe that by 2025 some 400 ports in the U.S., Europe and China will have to be equipped to supply electrical
power to their ship customers. We also expect that in the same time period, around 1,000 containerships, somewhat 6,000 bulk cargo ships will
have to be equipped to receive Shore Power.

So in conclusion, we expect the Shore Power market to grow substantially in the next 5 years.

Now let's change gears and talk about automatic charging for e-ferries.

(presentation)

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
Isn't this fantastic? This is delivering the future today. Cavotec has developed and brought into operation the most powerful automated charging
system for e-ferries in the world today, a 5-megawatt fast battery charger. The automation and the speed of our charging system is the key enabler
for electrical vessel market development. Without this technology, there wouldn't be any e-ferries. This is the future today that we have made
possible and another great example of how we deliver profitable sustainability for our customers.

Now let's talk about the market potential here. Norway has been the early adopter of e-ferries and represents addressable market for charging
worth EUR 75 million over the next 5 years. We strongly believe that the rest of the Nordic countries and then the U.S. and some other countries
will follow as they already actively running design studies to electrify their ferry routes. We also see a growing interest from other countries with
large ferry networks, such as Japan, South Korea, which are currently running feasibilities as we speak.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And finally, let's look into port electrification, and more specifically automated charging for e-trucks.

(presentation)

Patrick Mares - Cavotec SA - President of Ports & Maritime Division
So did you note is that the core technology used in this application is the same we're using for e-ferries. So when we look at electrification and
automation of ports, it's not only the ship to show electrical connection that is changing, the electrification of the rest of the port operations is
accelerating quickly, if not quicker. An area of port electrification has a huge growth potential is automated high-power charging of battery-powered
for trucks. Efficiency safety and vehicle uptime are key drivers in this area when ports are considering converting their fleet of diesel-powered trucks
to zero-polluting e-trucks. And the Cavotec solution that you saw meets all of these 3 requirements through a fast, automated, high-power charging
solution that also keeps workers safe.

So this is the future today that we also made possible. The Port of Long Beach and the American Association of Port Authorities have already
recognized what a breakthrough this technology is. We're very proud to be awarded 2020 Facilities Engineering Award for this solution. And this
is exciting as it shows this -- now already early acceptance in the industry for our solution, and it opens the doors for significant growth opportunities.

So talking about the market potential. We know there are about 40,000 diesel-powered terminal trucks in ports around the world today. About
2,000 of those trucks are located just in California, which has a legislation for zero-emission ports by 2030, and over 0.5 billion in government
funding to drive this change.

So to summarize, Cavotec is at the right market at the right time with the right solutions. The industry is undergoing a fundamental shift towards
sustainability, are also looking for improvements in productivity, and I believe we are uniquely positioned to provide profitable sustainability for
our customers.

So thank you for your attention. And with that, I'll now hand it over to Juergen.

Juergen Strommer - Cavotec SA - Division President of Airports & Industry
Thank you very much, Patrick. We're happy to have the chance to talk to you about Airports & Industry today. Let's start with the short video showing
our offerings to you.

(presentation)

Juergen Strommer - Cavotec SA - Division President of Airports & Industry
I'm going to start talking about airports. In airports, we are providing state-of-the-art cloud support equipment for powering, cooling, heating and
fueling equipment through our in-ground solutions. Both commercial and military customers improve their efficiency and safety while reducing
pollution with our systems. We have a full portfolio of cloud support solutions, making us the only provider of a complete fully integrated system.
We also have the widest range of temperature control solutions, which has been the success factor in geographies with extreme temperatures,
such as Bahrain airport. This is a strength as the world is experiencing more and more extreme temperature events. An additional strength is that
we have our own engineering and manufacturing in the world's largest aviation market, the U.S., which has given us the largest installed base of
in-ground systems in the world.

Being approved as a supplier to the military aviation market is also a strength of ours. As you can see to the right, we have a wide range of customers
from airports in Dubai and Miami to aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus and Boeing. Frankfurt airport is one of our customers in Europe, which
we have a very long-standing relationship with. Frankfurt airport, as all of our customers, are looking for profitable sustainability solutions, and this
is how they frame it. As you're fully aware, the aviation market is going through turbulent times. However, global population growth will continue

                                                                                                                                                                             
 and with the merchants of a growing middle class in developing countries. We, therefore, strongly believe that the world demand for air infrastructure
will continue to grow.

Another aspect is how critical the aviation industry is in keeping the global supply chain moving. The increased focus on fast deliveries will further
drive this development. In a challenging environment, the focus on productivity drives investment decisions while the pressure to address
environmental challenges have increased.

We are well positioned to support our customers with these challenges today through delivering profitable sustainability solutions. Taking a closer
look at the COVID impact on our airport business, we find that the market dynamics are changing from large greenfield project to expansions and
upgrades for existing infrastructures. Actually, we are currently tracking more projects for decision in 2021, then in the beginning of 2020, and we
expect an increase for the years to come. What we see for these projects is that customers want to move to flexible gates that can accommodate
various aircraft types and sizes, thereby increasing their efficiency.

Let me explain you how we do this today. At Bahrain Airport, our E3 system increases the flexibility of the gate. Configurations, enabling the airport
to either have one wide-body aircraft at the gate or 2 narrow bodies. This maximizes the gate utilization and increases operational efficiency. In
addition, being able to faster connecting the services to the aircraft as the aircraft can turn off the engines sooner, which decreases fuel consumption
and pollution. Furthermore, having the system in-ground reduces the congestion at the gate caused by the mobile equipment. This reduces the
risk of damage to the aircraft while increasing safety for the workers on the ground. Actually, the International Air Transportation Association
estimates that damage to aircraft is costing the industry nearly USD 10 billion per year. Also, our solutions contribute substantially to reducing the
environmental impact today.

To the right, you can see some examples of how CO2 equivalent our solutions have eliminated as measured in the number of round trips from
Stockholm Arlanda London to London Heathrow. In total, these 3 airports alone, our solutions have removed the CO2 equivalent of more than
27,000 round trips and counting.

In conclusion, we see continued need for air infrastructure, but the dynamics of the market are changing towards less greenfield projects and more
expansions and upgrades. Our customers want increased flexibility and efficiency of their assets and the smaller environmental footprint. Our E3
System solution means that we are uniquely positioned to provide profitable sustainability for our customers.

Now let us turn to our Industry business. In Industry, we provide a wide range of solutions to electrify and remotely control heavy-duty vehicles.
We work very closely with leading OEMs to provide customized solutions that enhance productivity, increase safety and reduce environmental
impact.

Our portfolio of products includes remote controls, power connectors and cables. Our equipment is integrated in heavy-duty industrial machines,
such as from Sandvik, operating in some of the harshest environments in the world, where they must withstand extreme temperatures on a 24/7
basis. Our remote controls are installed across a wide range of industrial equipment to increase productivity and make the operation safer for the
end user. GS Global of the U.S. is an example of a new customer that is now integrating our remote control units. Another core capability is connecting
electrically powered equipment. Our power connectors and reels are trusted by the leading OEMs, such as (inaudible) to provide the reliability and
performance they need.

Let's talk about our growth strategy for Industry. In the past, we've been dependent on a few larger OEMs, as you know, who are increasingly
operating in mature segments. Our geographical reach has also been limited. We have recently invested in our sales and marketing capabilities to
target new OEMs with growing segments in new geographies where our technology plays an enabling role. We are particularly targeting applications
that are moving towards electrification, such as heavy-duty vehicles.

Let me show you what I'm talking about.

(presentation)
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Juergen Strommer - Cavotec SA - Division President of Airports & Industry
This is the future today what we have made possible. What you saw in the video is how remote control solution saves time and labor. Without
remote control, that same task would have needed several operators. In the next step, the operator can be removed entirely from the work site,
and instead, he can control several machines at different sites simultaneously from a single remote location. This translates into safe labor and
increased productivity. The risk of an accident is a factor anywhere where heavy machinery is operated. By moving the operator away from the
asset, we save lives today.

In conclusion, we are targeting high potential OEMs in new geographies with growing segments where we can provide the enabling technology.
Our solutions save lives, drive profitable sustainability for our customers.

Next, I would like to hand over to Patrick.

Patrick Baudin - Cavotec SA - President of Cavotec Services
Thank you, Juergen. Now let's talk about how we keep all these core technologies, which you've heard about running. But first, let's again, start
with a short video to give you an overview of the Services business.

(presentation)

Patrick Baudin - Cavotec SA - President of Cavotec Services
In Services, our core mission is to help customers maximize the availability and to extend the total lifetime of their installation. Our trained and
certified service experts are available around the clock to support the thousands of installation we have around the world. A number that is growing
by the day.

So what's so exciting about the Services business in Cavotec is that we have a huge untapped market. We now have a very good understanding
of this potential. To address this potential, we have developed a large range of service products from inspections to comprehensive maintenance
agreements, which are tailored to the white spot that you see on this chart.

So we are in a journey. We are on a journey to move up the value chain and thereby increasing the importance of Services to the group in twofold.
First, by growing our share of the group's revenue; and secondly, by providing a higher share of recurring revenues, such as service agreements.
We are doing this by moving from in the past, only having provided simple repairs and spare parts to in the future, offering complete, proactive,
fully connected solutions.

To give you an example, we have recently introduced an entry-level inspection program. This acts as a door opener to enable us to sell our extensive
range of service products. I know this works. In Malaysia, for example, crane delivered 10 years ago were inspected under this program, resulting
into an order for a multiyear service agreement. Another example is how we are interconnecting assets now around the world to develop predictive
maintenance offering. This is going to be the enabler to start offering product as a service.

We see another example of building recurring revenue is the recent renewal of a multiyear service agreement with the port of Salalah, same port
we saw in the video before. Here, we have service engineers on a full-time basis at the port to carry out all the preventive and corrective maintenance
of their MoorMaster system. As you can see here, availability is really critical for the customer. Another good example I like is, on the airport side,
is the multiyear service agreement we have with the airport in Miami for our installed base of equipment to cool and power aircraft. Here, you can
send a quote how critical that is for the customer to be able to provide a great passenger experience.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Right. So to summarize, we still have a large untapped potential from our installed base. This is clear. By moving up the value chain, we will generate
a recurring revenue and continue to increase our share of the group revenue. We offer profitable sustainability for our customers by maximizing
their availability and extending the lifetime of their assets. This is the future today that we have made possible.

Thank you. With that, I hand over to Glenn.

Glenn Withers - Cavotec SA - Group Senior VP & CFO
Thanks, Patrick. Okay. I will summarize where we've come from and where we are now, especially from a business performance standpoint. And
first, I'll start with where we came from, and a number of you know this already, but we've been on a 3-phase transformation journey. We completed
2 of the phases already, the first in '18 and then the second in '19. And I'll talk about the third phase soon, but before I do, I'll just recap the second
phase.

The second phase was about locking in the benefits of the transformation and establishing a performance culture in Cavotec, that was our key aim
in 2019. And just to summarize our achievements on that objective: Firstly, we're committed to hold the line on revenue, and that's despite an
intense transformation, which had involved changing almost everything and also included a significant reduction in headcount. That was our first
objective, and we did achieve that.

Secondly, we wanted to establish a business that was more consistent in delivering profits and generating cash. In fact, in 2019, we delivered 4
consecutive quarters of improving financial performance.

Thirdly, we invested in commercial and operational improvements. The aim of these improvements was to have the right momentum in sales to
generate growth and to strengthen our operations in customer support centers to deliver on that growth.

The summary of all that is, we exited 2019, ready to capitalize on all the hard work that we have done up until that point. We've established a strong
performance culture, and we're ready to grow.

So now I move to now. We entered 2020 with a good deal of confidence that we would deliver on the third phase of the transformation journey
to start our growth. It will not come as a surprise to any of you that the world had something different in store for us. So when the COVID-19
pandemic hit, firstly, our factory in northern Italy was closed for more than a month. That, together with a complete shutdown of our ability to
service our customers due to travel restrictions, contributed to a 20% decline in our revenues in the first half of this year.

However, because of the performance culture that we'd established, we were quick to react and adapt to this new reality. It's also true that our
people already knew how to proactively manage cost. And this meant that despite the impact to our topline, we're able to deliver profits and cash
even from the lower volume that I just talked about.

In fact, we're able to improve our profit margin and generate more cash when compared to the same period in the prior year. A further sign of
strength is that we, in the midst of all that financial turbulence caused by the pandemic, were able to secure a new long-term financing agreement
as scheduled for Cavotec.

Finally, talking about our published financial targets. These are underpinned by our ambition to grow organically 5% per year. Today, you've heard
from each of our business leaders about the key opportunities in their respective business units, and why we remain confident about our future
ability to grow.

To summarize that, in Ports & Maritime, Patrick highlighted the great opportunities that we have in Shore Power and automated mooring. Either
one of these opportunities individually has more than enough potential to deliver the required growth in our targets. In Airports & Industry, Juergen
highlighted the current shift in the airports market towards projects that will improve existing infrastructure, and the customers want more flexible
gate configurations to accommodate a wider variety of aircraft at the same gate. We are in a great position to capitalize on that shift with our
integrated in-ground solutions and therefore, also to live on our growth aspirations in that market.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And finally, looking at Services, Patrick highlighted the journey that we're on. We will increase the proportion of group revenue coming from
Services. And because of all the white spots that Patrick showed you on the chart that he had up earlier, a chart that talks about our large installed
base, we know our Services business is primed for growth. Because of that, the conclusion is that each of the 3 businesses are in a good position
to capitalize on the global trends that are currently driving those markets.

And with that, I hand back to you, Mikael.

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Thank you very much, Glenn. You have heard us today to talk repeatedly about the mega trends that we see in the market around automation,
safety and the environment, and how we are building on those to help customers manage these often competing priorities. Our solutions help
and do more with less, while at the same time, protecting their people and equipment and reducing the environmental impact. And this is what
we call profitable sustainability.

Now being well positioned today does not mean that we are resting on our laurels. We want to invest further in accelerating our organic growth.
2020 is an exceptional year. We all know that. There is a choice for industries to take and businesses to take. You can either scale back and wait and
be afraid about what's going to happen or you can go into offensive and say, if this is a year of one step back, then the next years are going to be
of many steps forward. And that is the approach that we are taking to invest now to be able to more than overcome and far away from our
competitors and will be well positioned in the future.

Let me give you a few examples. I am very pleased to announce today that we will open a new innovation center in the beginning of 2021, focusing
on profitable sustainability solutions for maritime customers, building on the momentum that we see in the market. This new center will be in
charge of research and development activities to bring to maturity breakthrough solutions to help them increase efficiency and productivity while
also reducing environmental impact.

We're going to gather in one place our capabilities in areas, such as artificial intelligence, remote connectivity, high-speed, high-power charging
and battery technology. That's the future. And this innovation center, we decided to locate it in the Netherlands, and the reason for that is that it
gives us access to a big maritime cluster, home to many leading shipping lines and port terminal operators. There is also a huge pool of talent there
that we want to tap into.

In addition to that, in the same location, we are also going to build up a new center of excellence for turnkey solutions with subject matter experts
within fields, such as product management, civil engineering, project finance and so on. This is going to strengthen our ability to meet the increasing
demand from our customers to deliver complete turnkey solutions, but it will also form the base for a future being able to offer product as a service,
which is again a trend that we see in the market.

Now we're not going to sit around and wait for an innovation center to innovate and come up with new exciting products. In fact, we have a major
product launch coming up in a few weeks' time. So stay tuned for that.

Now we're at the end of our presentation, and let me wrap up with a few conclusions.

Again, we are well positioned when it comes to global market strengths. We offer profitable sustainability solutions to our customers that will meet
these competing challenges that they face of increasing productivity without impacting their environmental footprint, actually trying to reduce
that at the same time. We have gone on the offensive. We are investing on our capabilities and products.

And finally, we have built a performance culture in this organization where we are able to capitalize on these opportunities.

With that, huge thank you for your attention so far today. We have Q&A coming up. I'm going to hand back to you, Johan.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Thank you, Mikael. Okay, that's it. Not really. I think I should look at the notes here. But basically, we are done with the presentation. So this is what
we're presenting today. So now we start the Q&A session. And Anna, we have a microphone here in the room. So for anyone who wants to ask the
question, please just ask Anna for the microphone.

We do also have more than 50 audience online. So for you who are online, we asked you to you -- who are on phone, you can just connect with
the operator. And you, who are online with the computer, watching this, please send an e-mail to the address that you will find at the bottom of
the page. And I will receive that e-mail here so I can read your questions.

So with that, I open up for questions here first in the room.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Karl Bokvist - ABG Sundal Collier Introduce - Analyst
Karl Bokvist, ABG. So my first question is on the Ports & Maritime, and thank you for the presentation, first of all. But your assessment there on the
total potential size of ports that would require Shore Power, what sort of segmentation do you think is needed here in? How you get to the 400?
And how many do you think will be in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia, for example?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
I think what's -- in terms of segmentation, there are different sizes of ports. Looking at the European regulation coming out about 3,000 ports in
Europe that needs to be electrified. Obviously, they range from large cargo ports like the one in Rotterdam to a small regional port in Greece, right?
Now what is unique, and Patrick showed you is the wide range of products that we have that can actually provide solutions to all of those markets.

We are segmenting the market to where it is -- where we get the most bang for the buck in terms of the sales resources that we put in. Obviously,
looking at markets that are driven heavily by regulation right now. We're talking about Europe. Patrick said, we're talking about California, U.S.,
West Coast rather than the East Coast and so on. That's something that we do with our sales organization.

Karl Bokvist - ABG Sundal Collier Introduce - Analyst
Yes. That was my follow-up actually because I think, as you mentioned, there are over 1,000 ports in Europe alone. So when you say that sort of
bang for buck, is it that some ports are simply not feasible enough for, perhaps, your product strategy in terms of electrifying it?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
No, I think it's more about the go-to-market strategy and the cost for go-to-market, the cost for touching all of those opportunities. And that's
where we are -- have been, and we are developing a strategy. Anything from cold calling, smaller ports, obviously, personal visits to a large port
from the beginning and thereby, seeing where we find interest.

Karl Bokvist - ABG Sundal Collier Introduce - Analyst
And final question on the ship side of Shore Power. And does the ship required to be dry docked in order for the solution to be installed?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Not with our containerized solution, the one that you saw. Also, if you remember the big green, that's the plug-and-play kind of system. It does
not need to be dried out. Obviously, it needs to be import, it helps, so that we can get access to it. But -- and it can take up to a couple of days to
do that, but it does not need to be dried dock.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Then I think we should move online. Do we have any questions online from that the operator has received? No? Okay. So no questions online either.
So it seems to be a very crystal clear presentation that has to give very few questions.

No, we have. Okay.

Unidentified Analyst
My name is (inaudible). The question relates to your Service business. You talked about the potential in broader terms. My question is, how larger
share of your business today is Service business? And what do you think is the potential share of your total?

And as a follow-up on that, what would that imply to your profitability?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Do you want to answer that, Patrick, being responsible for the business?

Patrick Baudin - Cavotec SA - President of Cavotec Services
Thank you for that question. So as we have mentioned, the Service business is globally today 20% of the group revenue. And as I showed you on
the slide, we are on a journey. So we started really on the pure corrective phase, and we're moving now into a preventive, predictive and proactive
phase. So it's a journey. So we expect we can get more, obviously, in group shares, but it's just a matter of time. And it's getting the right strategy
and the right actions in place to make sure we can grow.

Unidentified Analyst
So a follow-up there on the Service side. I think you mentioned this before, but all of your hardware offering today is that connected or ready to
be connected?

Patrick Baudin - Cavotec SA - President of Cavotec Services
Yes. Very, very pleased to say that we're starting to gather data from our equipment. The next step, as I mentioned, is to move towards predictive
maintenance, so meaning getting analysis of this data to be able to take actions, concrete maintenance actions towards our equipment. But we
are moving forward in connecting our equipment, clearly, and we already have quite a bit of equipment.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay, and then a follow-up for me on both port side and the airport side, actually. I think your view on how these markets will develop are, of
course, very clear. That's what sort of hurdles do you still see that customers are not yet -- well, passing through or passing by, so to say, in order
for the market really to accelerate?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Well, I think as mentioned by Juergen in the Airport side, what is interesting is that we're actually tracking more project opportunities now for
decision in the near future than we were at the beginning of the year, which has to do how the market dynamics have changed. Now we should
also say to track a project does not mean that it has gone to decision, right. And that is the uncertainty in the market right now around decision
time horizon definitely. So we'll see that. But there is a lot of interest. And what we've seen is the market dynamics changing towards, okay, probably
not gigantic greenfield projects in the future, how can we adapt what we have to more flexibility, more productivity by increasing the gate efficiency
and so on. That's a lot of the conversations that have started up now for us.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
So -- okay. It's good. Continue here and then we move online.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Just as a follow-up on Mikael. You talked about, well, relatively fewer greenfield and more sort of investing in current sort of ports and airports.
Do you see this happening sort of on the long horizon? Or is this sort of the COVID situation, just having spook the market or sort of what are...

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
No. I think, the -- you mean if this change in market dynamics, if that's permanent. Is that your question?

Unidentified Analyst
Exactly.

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Absolutely, I do think so. And that is natural, actually that there is a harder look at how can we do more with less. How can we do more with what
we have, even in area as such because in many parts of the world, airport infrastructure is government owned. It's publicly owned. So they may
not have had that kind of productivity pressure before, but that's what we see is changing.

Unidentified Analyst
And Johan, if I may, just a quick follow-up on that. Do you see you need to change your overall sort of portfolio being in regards to perhaps smaller,
more customized solution rather than the sort of big installations that you've sort of done previously that you need more flexible portfolio?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
No, I think what we're seeing is that we actually in a more a better position because of that because you really need to have one, someone who
can deliver a system, a system integration and in-ground solution, which has not been the standard in the past. And that's what we've been able
to deliver now which can provide that flexibility as you saw on the quote from Frankfurt airport, for example.

So better positioned than ever, I would say. Now again, when decisions will happen, we can debate, with the COVID situation, but incredibly well
positioned for that change in the market.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Okay, very good. I have a question from Chris Wright from H.C. Capital Advisors. Actually few. So I would read them loud, and then we distribute
them. So do you think now that corona has mostly passed with respect to lockdowns -- now that it has passed mostly with respect to lockdowns
that you will see your order book rebuild back to the Q4 level of 2019?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
It's very hard for me to speculate in how markets are going to open up and when corona will really have been passing and so on. Eventually, as
you saw from our presentation, we strongly believe that we are positioned for a growth journey again. If I knew more about how corona would
play out, I guess I would be a very rich man or become one.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Yes. And I think you'll answer -- respond yesterday. Do you think it's possible to recreate Q4 '19 profitability with the business? Or was this a one-off?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
No. That we have actually announced as a target that we're going to go to that kind of profitability level. We are committed that we're going to
come back to that.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
And then a question for, I guess, for you, Glenn. Do you expect cash conversion of EBITDA to improve during the second half of this year and during
2021? Of course, that's not a very easy answer to that, but at least, I think it's worth commenting on it.

Glenn Withers - Cavotec SA - Group Senior VP & CFO
Okay. There are 2 questions, I think, and that were cash flow this year, rest of this year, cash flow early next year. Actually, the answer to that is a
little bit similar to Mikael's. I don't have a looking glass into when recovery comes. But what I can say is that if you look at our first half performance,
and also in a few days' time, end of this month, we'll be talking about Q3 performance, but first half performance, we were able to generate
profitability, decent margin for the circumstances, down 20% in revenue and cash flow.

And the reason for that, I believe, is because we were very well prepared coming into COVID, not because we saw COVID coming, but because we
prepared our business and the platform after a long transformation, ready to deliver growth in a sustainable way, meaning that in a consistent and
sustainable performance on a quarterly basis.

So I think all of those things mean we're in as good a shape as we were pre-COVID to deliver on profit and cash as we were before.

So that's my response about the cash flow. I can't say the exact predictions around, again, how the market will perform in the short term, but we're
in great shape the way we came into this.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
I could ask this last question from online to you, Patrick, but I think we will also look at our CEO, see who answers it. Where do you see aftermarket
being as a percentage of total sales by end of 2021, '22? I look at both of you.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
I mean, yes, if I may -- if I give you just a start to the answer. Like Patrick pointed out, we are on a journey. We are on a journey with definitely the
ambition to grow the Service business because it makes so much sense. We all know that inherently, a Service business if run well is a very profitable
business. So that's one of the reasons that it is in our interest to grow it.

Secondly, we know that well round Service business drives new business also, new sales, new systems where customers feel that they are supported
through the whole life cycle. And also, of course, it is in our interest because it also provides stability in terms of recurring revenue, service contracts
and so on. So -- and we are on that journey, and our ambition is to grow that as much as we can as fast as we can. But of course, that it takes also
hard work to build out that journey. Would you like to add something?

Patrick Baudin - Cavotec SA - President of Cavotec Services
Yes. I -- Maybe I could also talk about the benefits we bring to our customers. We're focusing on bringing our availability and also extending lifetime
of assets. As we mentioned today, a lot of customers are looking at extending some of their asset's life. So I think this is also a very good positioning
for this Service division in the coming days.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
I think Carl maybe has a question. Yes.

Unidentified Analyst
First of all, I think your long-term margin target now is that you would like to reach or exceed 12% in a few years?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Correct.

Unidentified Analyst
Well, I think the initial question is, has anything changed recently that will make you more or less optimistic about that target?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
If we disregard corona which is but... so no, on the long term -- on medium- to long term, we remain committed to those targets. Now as I said, 21
step back year, right, but we want to get back to that journey towards those targets. Absolutely we're committed to that as a business.

Unidentified Analyst
And my second one is also on partnerships because I think when you highlighted the terminal tractors there, for example, there was a lot of --
beyond your dream trucks. How dependent are you on partnerships with one single manufacturer. So for example, do you -- are your technologies
somewhat agnostic that you can also connect with Kalmar trucks and PMC cranes?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Yes. This technology developed for this application to port a long bridge was not developed towards a certain manufacturer of a truck. It was a
commercial truck that was converted to battery operation, and we believe that, that is going to be a huge part of the market. It would be an
enormous cost for port terminals around the world to replace these 40,000.

And of course, it's going to happen tomorrow, but even over time. So converting existing port tractor is going to be a huge market for us. And part
of also, I want to link this to the Innovation Center and the Center of Excellence in the Netherlands, which is all so about exactly that. About
developing this type of plug-and-play approach solutions in the same way that we did for retrofitting ships to be able to take Shore Power.

So we have an offering where we can go to these ports and say, leave it to us, we will, together with the right partners, rebuild these trucks for you
and convert them.

Unidentified Analyst
And final for me is, with your balance sheet, which has improved quite a lot recently. So if you -- you will, of course, invest in that Innovation Center,
but are there other options when it comes to capital allocation either to shareholders or inorganic opportunities for growth?

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
What I can say in terms of access to capital, I'd just like to look at our -- many of our main shareholders represented here today and look at the
Board. We've had a very supportive Board in terms of the plans that we have. I don't feel that there is a restriction there if we come with the right
business case in terms of what is the best way to raise the capital for that.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
So I jump online again and read a question from (inaudible) from the Fourth AP Fund. His question is, where are you on the productification journey
of the MoorMaster? Is it fully modularized? Or do you have to do a whole lot of engineering on every installation? So it's about standardization,
basically, how far have we come here? I think this question refers to the history, and I think it's a really crucial question. So maybe if you...

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
Should I give it a shot? I understand where the question is coming from. Since, I would say, well, it's 3 years now, we have a standard product range
within MoorMaster. So it is not a tailored solution every time, which -- that was in the past. And I think that, again, has contributing to us going into
that next phase of the adaptation curve that you saw in the presentation with a wider adaptation of automatic mooring because there is a standard
offering of units. So yes, we've come a long, long, long way there.

Johan Hähnel - Cavotec SA - IR Manager
Okay. Do we have more questions in the room? Nothing on the telephone and no more e-mails to me here. So I think that we will with that conclude
this day, would you like to say any -- final words, not last words, I hope, but final words.

Mikael Norin - Cavotec SA - Group CEO
I hope it's not last word, definitely. No, what I would like to say, first again, thank you for giving us your attention today. I would really encourage
everyone in the room and on the web to keep following us. I hope that we gave you some exciting news and insights today. They will keep coming.
So stay tuned. There is a lot of exciting stuff happening. As I said, we're going on the offensive. We've decided we are not going to hold back and

                                                                                                                                                                             
 be afraid about what's to happen. We're going on the offensive. We have a window now to really capitalize on the momentum and the position
that we have and get in front of the competition, get in front of this market and be ready when it turns. Because turn, it will. And when it turns, it
will turn even more towards what we talked about here.

Solutions that provide increased productivity and reduced environmental footprint at the same time. Profitable sustainability, it's what we're all
about. So stay tuned. Thank you.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the Rolls-Royce conference call. (Operator Instructions) Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.

Today, I am pleased to present Warren East, Chief Executive; Stephen Daintith, Chief Financial Officer; and Isabel Green, Head of Investor Relations.

I will now hand over to Isabel to begin the call. Please go ahead with your meeting.

Isabel Green - Rolls-Royce Holdings plc - Head of IR
Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call at short notice. As introduced by Keith, I've got with me this
morning Warren East and Stephen Daintith. In a moment, I'm going to hand over to Warren for some introductory remarks before we open the
lines for your questions.

A little disclaimer here. I mean on the call today, we may refer to the investor presentation that was published today. It's available to download on
our website.

I also need to remind you that we may not be able to respond to certain questions relating to rights issue or bond offering details and that's for
regulatory reasons. And we will not be able to discuss specifics of the rights issue or the bond offering themselves.

We will direct you now to our announcement this morning for those answers and the prospectus for those details.

Thank you, and over to Warren.

D. Warren A. East - Rolls-Royce Holdings plc - CEO & Executive Director
Thank you, Isabel. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us.

I'm pleased to be in a position now to update you on the plans we have to improve our liquidity headroom and reduce our level of balance sheet
leverage to safeguard our business as we return to generating strong positive cash flows. For those of you looking at the slides, I am going to refer
to some of the slides. And so we'll start on Page 5, which shows the package of solutions that we're proposing and that package coming together
to increase our resilience through a combination of complementary self-help and external measures.

Now the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our industry has been unprecedented, we've said that before. And despite entering
this year with excellent momentum in our operating and financial performance and despite the rapid measures we've put in place to deliver GBP
1 billion of cash savings in 2020, we still expect to experience a free cash outflow this year of approximately GBP 4 billion.

Now we acted quickly to address the impact of the pandemic because alongside that GBP 1 billion of one-off in-year cost savings for 2020, we
launched a fundamental restructuring, predominantly of our Civil Aerospace business, in order to deliver annual pretax cash savings of GBP 1.3
billion by the end of 2022. And we believe this restructuring program, together with an anticipated recovery in the end markets, will help us to
restore financial performance. And we aim to be delivering free cash flow generation of at least GBP 750 million excluding any impact of disposals
as early as 2022.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 However, the pathway to that sustainable, positive cash flow remains dependent on the recovery from COVID-19 particularly with regard to
long-haul air travel. And there is significant uncertainty about the precise timing and the shape of this recovery, and so the possibility of delay in
that does remain. And we consider it prudent, therefore, to prioritize resilience and flexibility, in particular, taking into account our reasonable
worst-case scenario.

And as a result, today, we're announcing plans to increase our resilience through the uncertainty with the recapitalization package. We're commencing
a GBP 2 billion rights issue and intend to launch a bond offering of at least GBP 1 billion in the near future. In addition, we have agreed commitments
for a new GBP 1 billion 2-year term loan, and we have an indication of support in principle from UK Export Finance Bank for extension of their partial
guarantee of our existing 5-year term loan to support an increase in that term loan of a further GBP 1 billion. So these additional potential loans
are subject to various conditions including, importantly, completion of the rights issue. So this is an integrated package.

We believe that these actions, coupled with targeted gross proceeds of more than GBP 2 billion from a number of potential disposals which we
announced at our half year results in August, would enable us to navigate the uncertain macroeconomic environment. It's not been an easy decision
to get here. We've already put in place more than GBP 4 billion of additional borrowing facilities since the start of this crisis, but there is a limit to
the amount that we can reasonably expect solely from our banks and the bond market without addressing the leverage as well.

We have approximately GBP 3.2 billion of debt and credit facilities due to mature over the next 13 months. And that includes the undrawn GBP 1.9
billion revolving credit facility, which will be canceled on completion of the rights issue. The GBP 3 billion cumulative proceeds from the rights
issue and the intended bond offering announced today will largely cover those maturities and allow us to deliver disposals in a manner that ensures
enhanced value for shareholders.

So now let's move on to Slide 8. We've spoken a lot about the uncertainty in the timing and the shape of recovery. We believe that the base case
shown here is the most probable outcome, and our large engine flying hours data over July and August has tracked slightly ahead of expectations.
However, uncertainties remain around the timing and the shape of recovery, in particular, given the inspection rates are rising again especially
when you think about Europe.

Our reasonable worst-case scenario assumes a significant delay in recovery with engine flying hours in 2021 at only about 45% of 2019 levels. And
in that event, in addition to lower large engine flying hour receipts, we would expect adverse trading conditions across the rest of our business
too, probably with the exception of Defence, which we expect to remain resilient. So there's more detail on the reasonable worst-case scenario
included in the working capital statement on Page 31 of the presentation and also in the full rights issue prospectus, which should be read prior
to making an investment decision.

It's our responsibility to prepare for the reasonable worst case. And in consideration of the outcome alongside continued global and macroeconomic
uncertainty, we've determined that it is in the best interest of shareholders to take the actions that we set out today.

Slide 10 sets out the reasons why we need to rebuild our balance sheet and what our ambitions are in the medium term. We aim to restore the
company to a net cash position in the coming years through a combination of GBP 2 billion gross disposal proceeds, as we announced in our half
year results, and an expected return to positive free cash flow during the second half of 2021 and a GBP 2 billion rights issue announced today.

This is important commercially, competitively and financially. A strong financial position does matter to our customers. In Civil Aerospace, airline
customers signed multiyear service contracts with us. They want to know that we can be relied on as a long-term partner, and we'll live up to our
side of the contract. Similarly, in Civil Aerospace and Defence, we're committed to long-term investment cycles in order to win positions on new
programs. Our customers need to know that we are resilient enough to be able to invest in those products through the cycle. And that's why we
remain committed to our ambition to return to an investment-grade credit rating in the medium term, and we think that we need to act now to
prevent further deterioration and start the journey back to where we need to be.

So Slide 14 now, moving on to Slide 14. This shows our sort of recovery path back to free cash flow generation of GBP 750 million as early as 2022,
premised on our base case recovery assumptions before adjustment for any potential disposals. And we spoke about this at our interim results, so
                                                                                                                                                                             
 I'm not going to go through it all in detail again today but just a little bit more color on how we expect that improvement in cash generation to
unfold.

First, cash flow recovery is not dependent on any large working capital inflows, only on the nonrepeat of the working capital outflows that we're
experiencing in 2020. And that includes the impact of our -- the onetime impact of our decision to cease the invoice discounting.

Secondly, we expect an improvement of around GBP 2 billion in cash from Civil Aerospace business with engine flying hours expected to return
in our base case to 90% of 2019 levels by the end of 2022 as well as improvements in time and materials work and importantly, significantly lower
Trent 1000 in-service costs and lower losses on installed wide-body OE deliveries.

Thirdly, the actions we're taking to resize our fixed cost base and reduce our capital intensity. We've reduced our head count already by over 4,000
since we announced the cost reduction program in May. And we're confident that by 2022, we will have delivered the approximately GBP 1.3 billion
of annual cost benefits that we've identified.

While timing and shape of the recovery is uncertain, we think that these actions, which aren't or in our control, will enable us to adapt and thrive
whatever the future holds.

Finally, we can see continued resilience in Defence and a recovery in Power Systems, and that's expected to contribute an additional GBP 200
million to '22 cash flows compared to 2020 cash flows. So remember, the GBP 750 million cash flow ambition still includes nonpermanent costs.
Nonpermanent costs of approximately GBP 300 million related to reducing the size of our FX hedge book, and it includes GBP 200 million to GBP
300 million related to Trent 1000 disruption and in-service costs. And so those nonrepeat items will still be there in that GBP 750 million in 2022.
We expect our target free cash flow to grow further in the future as those temporary negative outflows diminish over time.

Moving forward a little, Slide 16 and 17 are a reminder of our strong foundation in Civil Aerospace established over decades of investments in
engineering and design. We've recently completed a multiyear investment cycle. We've got 4 wide-body engine programs that have been launched
since 2010, which have taken our market share of in-service wide-body passenger planes up from 26% 10 years ago to 38% by December '19. Our
share of the order book is even stronger at 55% in December 2019. And our investment overall in our Civil Aerospace fleet means that by the end
of 2019, we had more than 5,000 installed wide-body engines with an average age of less than 9 years. And so most of the planes that we power
are the newer, more-economic, lower-carbon-footprint planes than our customers and their passengers want to use.

As our engine programs mature, the investment needs to reduce, of course, manufacturing efficiency improves, pricing increases, and the risk of
in-service issues diminishes. And all of that creates a significant inflection in the financial performance. We think that we were already actually
reaching that pivot point before COVID-19. But despite the current disruption, these underlying value drivers will continue to have a positive impact
on our business performance.

Now we tend to focus a lot on wide-body. Our business aviation has been less impacted by COVID-19 than the commercial aviation. For those
people that can afford it, business jets enable passengers to mix less with other travelers and have more control over their flight plans. And we've
got over 7,000 engines installed on business jets, and our strong product positions mean that, that gives us 30% -- more than 30% of the market
by value. And this is an area of Civil Aerospace that's often overlooked when we talk about our performance, but it's a key pillar of our strategy, an
area where we've seen more resilience through the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Slide 18, we sent out the ambition for the future beyond 2022. In addition to the embedded value in Civil Aerospace, we can see potential for
underlying growth in both Defence and Power Systems.

In Defence, we had a record order intake in 2019. It's actually the fifth -- the 5 years of very strong order intake in Defence. And in addition, we're
competing for new business to drive growth in Defence into the longer term on programs that will be running for several decades into the future.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And in Power Systems, we're well positioned in key growth areas such as mission-critical backup power. And we're also driving market share in
high-growth markets through our expansion in China and India. And as a result, we think Power Systems can grow at a 5% to 10% underlying
revenue CAGR from 2021.

Underpinning all of that growth beyond 2022, the world is shifting ever more towards a net zero carbon economy. And the breadth of our engineering
expertise and our established access to a range of end markets means that we're well positioned to play a crucial role in the transition through
increasingly efficient gas turbine engines in Aerospace, through innovating with hybrid products in Power Systems, and that's actually paving the
way for sustainable aviation as well through hybrid technology and aviation. And also, we're working on sustainable aviation fuels.

So once we achieve our aim of restoring financial returns and a more appropriate balance sheet, we'll be accelerating these aspects of our strategy,
and you'll see substantial growth in that starting to happen by 2025.

So to sum up, over the last 6 months, we've taken swift actions to minimize our cash outflow, restructure our business and position it for the future
in response to both the short-term and medium-term impact of the pandemic. We believe that the restructuring program, alongside an anticipated
recovery in our end markets, will help us to restore financial performance. But there is significant uncertainty around the precise timing and the
shape of the recovery from COVID-19. And as a result, we do consider it prudent to prioritize resilience and flexibility.

We thought carefully about the capital needs that we'll have over the next few years, and raising additional capital at this time will provide us with
3 key things: improved financial resilience and more liquidity headroom across 2021 in order to weather the macroeconomic risks before we return
to strong cash generation, which is expected as early as 2022; an improved level of balance sheet leverage supporting disciplined execution and
investment to ensure that we can maximize value from our existing capabilities; and thirdly, flexibility to allow us to pursue disposals in a manner
that delivers value for shareholders as we position the group for the long term to benefit from the new technologies that we have focused on
sustainable power.

We thought carefully about the size and the shape of this integrated package to ensure that this is sufficient to secure us against the downside risk
and also that it supports our deleveraging towards a net cash position over an acceptable time horizon. And as a result, we see this as a final major
step in our balance sheet repair. The focus is now on executing our turnaround and securing the disposal proceeds.

Ajay B. Shah - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - Executive Chairman of the Board
Thank you, Suzanne. I'd like to welcome everyone to this call and take this opportunity to introduce you all to Mark Adams, SMART's newly appointed
CEO and a member of our Board of Directors. We are very excited that he has joined our team, and I look forward to supporting Mark and the rest
of the management team in my ongoing capacity as Executive Chairman of the Board.

When I stepped into the CEO role about 2 years back to help lead the transformation of SMART, the company had roughly 2/3 of its revenue from
memory sales in Brazil. My goal was to take this base of business that the team had built over the past 30 years to grow and diversify our revenue
base into new markets while leveraging our operational strength. Since that time, we've come a long way, we've built up a Specialty Compute &
Storage business that has transformed the profile of our revenue mix, improved our gross margins and provided us with exciting new areas in
which to grow. At this stage, the company now has a tremendous opportunity to build and scale our organization and to further improve our
go-to-market strength and market positioning.

I think you will share the enthusiasm that the Board and I have that Mark is the right person to take this forward as our new CEO. I have known
Mark for many years and have more recently gotten to know Mark much more personally. He brings a wealth of management and technology
experience and a tremendous industry network that will be a great benefit to SMART as we move forward.

With that introduction, I'll turn it over to Mark.

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Ajay. First and foremost, I'd like to thank Ajay and the rest of the Board for entrusting me to carry on what he and the team have built
so far. In my brief time working with our management team and dedicated global team members, I've only become more excited to lead our growth
and diversification strategy.

I've actually known SMART for many years. When I joined Micron through the acquisition of Lexar, I ran the digital media group, which was a
combination of Lexar and Crucial, a competitor with SMART. And later, as I served as President of Micron, SMART was a valued customer. So I had
a good appreciation of the organization's core competencies.

What I've grown to appreciate more so during the search process, and even more recently during my time with the company, is the transformation
that Ajay has led along with the management team. SMART Global Holdings is very different than the memory company I knew in a prior life.
Penguin's high-performance computing success, coupled with smart, embedded and wireless computing, are growing into strong contributors
to our overall business. I'm also very impressed with the operating platform that Jack runs for the company with world-class operations in the U.S.,
Brazil and Malaysia.

In short, I'm excited to join a company in SMART that possesses a strong mindset, growth focused on diversification, combined with a strong
operating discipline. Beyond our operating business, I'm looking forward to leveraging my background in strategic M&A activity during our
continued diversification.

As I look at the industry landscape today, it is clear that semiconductor companies are facing unique challenges of increasingly more difficult
lithographies as well as to develop and use more advanced packaging capabilities. Additionally, compute resources are taking on an increasingly
more critical role in applications such as AI, machine learning and data analytics. When you look at all of these areas in terms of the growth markets
and the segments they serve, we align very well with the assets that we have in high-performance computing, memory integration capabilities,
embedded, compute and storage. The future is very bright. SMART is extremely well positioned to grow as a valued ecosystem partner to our
customers.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Let me now provide a business update, after which I will turn the call over to Jack for a closer look at our financial results and forward guidance.
Fiscal 2020 ended on a strong note with net sales and non-GAAP earnings per share coming in better than expected, which we believe is a testament
to our employees across the globe, who have excelled during these unprecedented times.

In addition, we have made good progress executing our growth and diversification strategy and remain in an excellent position to capitalize on
longer-term business trends that play to our strength globally. In particular, our business mix has dramatically transformed over the past several
years. Just 2 years ago, our business was dominated by Brazil at 62% of net sales for fiscal year 2018. We now enter fiscal 2021 with a much more
balanced mix of businesses. For the full year, fiscal 2020, Brazil was 35%, Specialty Memory was 42% and Specialty Compute & Storage was 23% of
overall revenue. Specialty Compute & Storage will continue to grow as a percentage of our overall business in fiscal 2021.

Let me turn to a review of each of our businesses for the fourth quarter. I'll start with Specialty Compute. Revenues for Specialty Compute totaled
$67 million in the quarter, representing an increase of approximately 10% from the prior quarter and comprising 23% of overall fourth quarter
revenue. The increase in the quarter was driven primarily by the resumption of some federal spending and importantly, a growing contribution
from Penguin's software and service offerings, which are key areas of our strategic focus.

One good example is Penguin's recent launch of a solution to meet the demand for real-time applications for memory infrastructure. Penguin is
offering scale cost effectively to many terabytes using Intel's Optane persistent memory, virtualized into massive pools of software-defined memory.
This is a good example of increasing importance of memory as it moves closer to the computing power in HPC applications, and we look forward
to announcing more of these types of successes in the future.

In addition, as an update to the partnership between Penguin and AMD around research-enabling ways to fight COVID-19 that we announced in
the prior quarter, just 2 weeks ago, Penguin announced the first petaflop of compute capacity in its data center is now online and available for
researchers. We look forward to continuing to support AMD and the participating universities and labs in this important endeavor.

We were pleased to be selected by NVIDIA, the partner network, as the HPC OEM Preferred Partner of the Year, our third year in a row of achieving
this distinction. We greatly appreciate such recognition from our strategic partner, which reflects our long history of driving innovation and serving
the evolving needs of our customers. Our pipeline continues to strengthen, highlighted by the recent receipt of Penguin's largest order ever just
2 weeks ago, and we are increasingly optimistic given the demand signals we are getting from our customers going into 2021.

Now on to Specialty Memory, which was 42% of our fourth quarter revenue, totaling $125 million in the quarter, roughly in line with the previous
quarter. Some of our enterprise and industrial customers are seeing a reduction in end customer demand due to COVID-19 and general macroeconomic
weakness. However, our design activity remains strong with new wins in the networking, telecom, compute and defense end markets. We also
continue to broaden our reach geographically with the formation of a Western Europe sales operation headquartered in Germany. Our team on
the ground there has a deep understanding of the market and the requirements of industrial customers in the region, and we are optimistic about
our ability to gain share in this new market for SMART.

On the product and technology front, we recently announced a Gen-Z development kit, the industry's smallest and easiest to use solution for
developing and testing Gen-Z fabric manager software for remote and tiered memory. This demonstrates our ability to deliver more advanced
designs to our leading OEM customers as we move up the stack and create higher-value solutions to meet the increasingly complex needs of our
customers.

And finally, our Brazil business, which generated approximately 35% of the quarterly net sales and totaled $105 million, up 13% sequentially. As
we expected, our ASPs improved in Brazil, driven by both an increase in the average density of memory and a recovery in the unit sales. As mobile
memory densities in Brazil still lag world averages, we continue to see ongoing improvement in our ASPs. Additionally, the latest forecasts from
our customers show a continued recovery in unit sales, positioning us for a solid start to fiscal 2021.

We continue to advance our technology development in our Brazil operations, which recently began qualification of 11 die stack technology at
our leading mobile customers. Investments like this help provide our in-country support of our major customers. As we indicated last quarter, the
new points-based manufacturing rules have been favorable to memory and less favorable to other parts of the business. We have recently made

                                                                                                                                                                             
 a strategic decision to exit the battery business and refocus our efforts and investments on 2 growth areas, IoT and SSD. We will continue to update
on our progress there.

Now I will turn the call over to Jack for a closer look at the financials before coming back to provide closing comments. Jack?

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Great. Thanks, Mark. We reported a strong quarter with solid improvements in all key financial metrics. Fourth quarter fiscal 2020 net sales of $297
million was 5.6% higher sequentially, driven by Specialty Compute & Storage and Brazil. Non-GAAP net income increased by 19.5% sequentially,
and non-GAAP EPS grew by 17.1% over the previous quarter, reaching $0.82 per share, demonstrating the financial leverage in our business model.
Cash and equivalents increased to $150.8 million at the end of the fiscal year, which is $20 million higher than the previous quarter.

The breakdown of net sales by end market for the fourth fiscal quarter was as follows: mobile and PCs, 31%; network and telecom, 25%; servers
and storage, 12%; industrial, defense and other, 32%. Strength in the mobile and PCs; industrial, defense; networking and telecom more than offset
lower sales to the server and storage end market.

Now moving to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross profit for the fourth quarter was $57.8 million or 19.5% of net sales compared
with last quarter's $55.9 million, which was 19.9% of net sales. Non-GAAP gross profit margin by business group was as follows: Specialty Compute
& Storage, 28%; Specialty Memory, 16%; Brazil, 19%.

In our fourth quarter, Brazil margins were lower than expected due to an accounting change that had no impact to net income as it impacted
operating expenses in a similar manner. This accounting change is also reflected in our guidance for Q1 and is related to how the Brazilian government
is encouraging local manufacturing. Without this change, the gross profit and operating expenses would both have been around 2% higher. As
Mark mentioned earlier, the points-based system is less favorable to batteries. We have made a decision to discontinue the operation of our Brazil
battery business in our just completed fiscal quarter, resulting in a charge of $3.5 million.

Non-GAAP operating expenses were $29.4 million compared with $35.5 million in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter
was $20.4 million or $0.82 per diluted share compared with $17.1 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the previous quarter. And adjusted EBITDA
totaled $33 million compared with $25.4 million in the prior quarter.

Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.2%, which was around 5% higher than expected. As many of you know, the way taxes are
calculated, they're based upon an estimate made at the beginning of the fiscal year as to what net income for the full year will be by geography
and company within a geography, but where profits will be domiciled. There are different tax rates for geographies as well as companies within a
geography. Example, in Brazil, our module company has a 40 -- 34% tax rate, while our packaging company has a 9% tax rate. Our full year profits
by country and company were different than what we had forecasted going into our fourth quarter.

Turning to working capital. Our net accounts receivable totaled $215.9 million compared with $223.2 million last quarter. Our days sales outstanding
remained essentially flat with last quarter at 45 days. Inventory totaled $163 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared with $180.6 million
at the end of the third quarter. Inventory turns remained flat, around 9 for both quarters. Consistent with past practice, accounts receivable, days
outstanding and inventory turns are calculated on a gross sales and cost of goods sold basis, which were $438.2 million and $381.9 million,
respectively, for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the difference between gross revenue and net sales is related to our supply chain services
business, which is accounted for on an agency basis, meaning that we only recognize as net sales the net profit on a supply chain services transaction.

We exited the year with a very strong cash position of $150.8 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $131.8 million at the end of the
prior quarter and $98.1 million at the end of our last fiscal year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations increased to $16.2 million compared with
$13.6 million in the prior quarter. For the year, cash flow from operations totaled $78.4 million. We exited our fourth quarter with a very strong
balance sheet as well as a vastly improved capital structure, thanks to the convertible note and subsequent restructuring and repayment of debt
that was executed earlier in the year. For those of you tracking CapEx and depreciation, CapEx was $7.4 million for the quarter and depreciation
was $5.2 million.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And now turning to our fiscal Q1 2021. Let me first provide you with some context with respect to our guidance. Our guidance reflects the accounting
change we made in Brazil, which decreased our gross margin as well as operating expenses with no impact to our net income.

With that as a backdrop, let me turn to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We currently estimate that our first quarter net sales will be
in the range of $280 million to $300 million. Gross margin for the quarter is estimated to be approximately 18% to 19%. GAAP earnings per diluted
share is expected to be approximately $0.28 per share, plus or minus $0.05. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding share-based compensation expense,
intangible asset amortization expense, convertible debt discount, OID and fees and other infrequent or unusual items, we expect non-GAAP
earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $0.70, plus or minus $0.05.

The guidance for the first fiscal quarter does not include any view on the foreign exchange gains or losses and includes an income tax provision
expected to be in the range of 12% to 16%. The number of shares used to estimate earnings per diluted share for the fourth fiscal quarter -- the
first fiscal quarter is 25 million. Capital expenditures for the first fiscal quarter are expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.

Please refer to the non-GAAP financial information section and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results and reconciliation
of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA tables in our earnings press release for further details.

Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Raji Gill from Needham.

Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Just, Jack, a little bit more clarification on the accounting change. Wonder if you could go in detail what's driving the accounting change specifically.
And should we be thinking about this type of gross margin and this type of OpEx level on a go-forward basis?

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Sure, Raji. So I'll answer the last part of your question. Yes, so we expect gross -- this will impact gross margin and operating expenses that we talked
about by about 2%. So we would expect to have a lower gross margin because of this in the future and also operating expenses decrease. So in
Brazil, they've been changing their rules because of the points-based system and also to have manufacturing more competitive. So there was a
change made to the law to give a -- what they call the financial credit to companies for local manufacturing to make them more competitive.

When the accountants looked at the rule and they came out, they said that you had to adjust and put this credit into -- as a contra to your operating
expenses. We had to reduce our operating expenses for this credit, which then took it out of other cost of goods sold. And so it's just a reclass
between the 2, it has no impact to net income, and we expect it to be -- to have the same impact on a go-forward basis.

Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. So you're just kind of moving it from one bucket to the next, but the net effect is 0.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Correct. Yes.

Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Yes. Okay. Now just on -- in terms of the fundamentals. And welcome, Mark. We look forward to working with you in the future. In terms of the
Penguin business, the specialty [SCAS] business. You had mentioned that the federal spending has resumed and that drove some growth, but also
mentioned some traction with Penguin. I'm wondering how we should kind of think about that business going forward as it contains many different
segments now. It contains Inforce, Penguin Computing, Artesyn and the like. So I'm thinking -- I'm wondering what are the kind of the growth
drivers in that segment as we go into kind of fiscal year '21.

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
So yes, I appreciate the question, and look forward to working with you as well. I think those questions can actually be broken up. It does come up
to Specialty Compute & Storage as a business category. But in each of them, they're very unique in terms of their end markets. And as you noted,
we did comment specifically on the call today about the backlog and funnel that Penguin has built up, and I mentioned our largest order ever at
Penguin.

I think in terms of that, we look at both the government and commercial sector. Within the commercial sector, there are areas like academics, oil
and gas, telecommunications, investment banking. We've actually had one of our largest customer opportunities with a hedge fund provider,
who's using our technology for advanced data analytics. And as you get closer to edge and on-premise, you see applications in our Artesyn business
and our Inforce business in terms of SMART embedded and SMART wireless that are the driving segments that are more IoT-driven and related
and then having to do with opportunities around commercial, around government, around education, around manufacturing and supply chain
management applications.

And so as you get further away from the high-performance compute environment, it's more IoT-driven wireless applications. Even some consumer
technology applications that are really pretty innovative, we're playing a great role in providing solutions. So it's a broad ecosystem, and that's why
it's easier probably to break it down into the way the businesses used to work.

But having said that, I think one of our biggest opportunities from a solution standpoint is that we're now providing an architecture that can go
end to end in terms of an application environment for strategic customers. We have a gas customer right now where they're using our
high-performance compute capabilities for analytics around customer behavior and they're using our IoT technology at the point of interface to
the customer. And we think that one of the reason of consolidating the strategic development of our solutions is that those assets, high-performance
computing and IoT with increasing investment in managed services can provide a really unique place for SMART to carve out future growth.

Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. Excellent. And then on the Specialty Memory, you had mentioned a reduction in enterprise spending. We saw this echoed by Micron in
specific markets. Can you talk a little bit about your view of enterprise spending and the impact that COVID had and how we're thinking about
next quarter? And the design wins that you're seeing in network and telco, how are they offsetting it? Just any color there would be helpful.

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Good question. And by the way, I'd just like to provide a little commentary because I did have a decade in memory on the Micron side and the
perspective I had. When COVID hit, I kind of felt like there was a typical reaction by the customers to grab inventory heading into the summer and
the fall, and I thought the demand was propped up some.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Now having said that, as you can see from the projections that Jack provided for Q1, we're pretty confident we're going to have a pretty strong
solid quarter. Now that has not been the case in broader semis that have already announced. And so pertaining to our business, it's not that we
see a dramatic softness in demand. We're just seeing that -- pertaining to COVID, I think there's been some inventory burn and some usual -- unusual
dynamics relative to, for example, Huawei and what their demand profile look like going into the back half of the calendar year.

So a lot of different dynamics going on. We called it out because we're seeing maybe some softness in certain areas, but certainly, as the numbers
suggest, growth in other areas have put us in a pretty good position for Q1.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel.

Brian Edward Chin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate
Ajay, first, thank you, and best of luck in your new role. And Mark, I just wanted to welcome you aboard as well. Maybe for my first question, in
terms of the November quarter guidance, maybe just to be a little bit more granular, looking at your sequential revenue trend, what are you
implying in terms of Specialty Compute, Brazil and Specialty Memory? And also just -- that's a part of the question. The other part is, in terms of
Specialty Compute, was that big order that you're seeing, is it more directed to the federal or commercial market? Kind of what's the shipment
timing against that? And what are those other signals that you're getting, Mark, that gives you confidence in the near-term revenue trends of the
business?

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, good question. The order I referred to was indeed part of our federal spending, and so we're pretty excited about that. But across both federal
and commercial, we're seeing increased spending in this environment and demand, I should say, as a result of the [expenditure]. But our funnel in
terms of our backlog is probably the healthiest ever since we've had the business at SMART. And when you think about the competitive landscape
there and you think about our position, Penguin's had a very long history in this business. And as we continue to find new opportunities and scale,
the HPC market is kind of on an uptick because the end segment drivers are there.

As I said, as you're aware, AI is a very hot world right now with people getting out and starting to further develop applications around that. Machine
learning, for sure. And even data analytics, like we're seeing a lot of investment into high-performance, quick data analysis-type models that are
providing kind of investment growth in the area, resulting in HPC demand.

So while we're not giving you necessarily a funnel number per se, I want to make sure that as we do that, we have a benchmark for you to understand,
but we're not doing that per se. Specifically, we see a much bigger funnel, the best funnel we've had since we've owned the business. And we're
very optimistic about some of the successful implementations we've had as kind of the beachhead for further growth.

Brian Edward Chin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate
Okay. Maybe -- another question maybe directed at you, Mark. Clearly, the strategic expansion of SMART into the Specialty Compute market has
been evident in the past few years. I understand it's early days for you, but looking at high-performance compute specifically, to achieve the right
balance or mix of customers, do you need to look inside the company to augment sort of the existing offerings with additional product services
and infrastructure?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I think that's right. I think maybe there's 2 areas to think about it. There's -- we've improved the margin in this business since day 1. Day 1, I think,
if I recall, the margins that -- upon acquisition on day 1 were roughly 15%, plus or minus. And those markets are now kind of approaching 20%,
21% gross margins. Now having said that, I think that business is going to be critical for us to add different capabilities that we don't necessarily
have today but have kind of a road map of what we'd like to get to.

I think 2 things: partnerships, which we think we have a good core set of partnerships with the likes of NVIDIA and AMD and Intel and others; but
more so in terms of value-add capabilities from a software, services and application layer that we'd like to develop and either through inorganic
activities or kind of partner with co-development, an existing software platform that's pretty sophisticated as it is.

It's just -- as we think about going up the stack, and that's -- you said it's only 30 days in, I'll tell you one leg of what I would espouse is going to be
a big strategy for us going forward is going to reflect in margin expansion. This is a great opportunity for this company, and we deserve more.
We've got to invest more and go get it. And I think we have the opportunity to do that based on, again, services and software layered on top of
our hardware architecture at Penguin.

Brian Edward Chin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Associate
That's great. Maybe just one quick thing on Brazil. Putting the local content changes to the side, it's been a while since we had units, content and
pricing all working together in the company's favor. Just curious, what gives you the confidence that the phone market in Brazil has turned a corner?
And what are you seeing or expecting in the quarters ahead in terms of content growth and also pricing trends?

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Yes. We talked about early -- I think last call that we're starting to see the densities grow again in Brazil, right? So we've now -- I think as Mark
mentioned on the call, we've developed a 64-gigabyte and now 132-gig product that's in quali. So if you look at the 64, it's doubling the amount
of flash that we've ever used and 132 would be 4x, right? So our density is going to go up in Brazil based on these new products that are under
qualification.

Remember, we don't qualify a product in Brazil and then you go try and sell it, right? We've already worked with the cell phone guys. This is on the
road map. This is what they need when we go qualify that product. So we know they're moving to higher-density products.

And also remember, Brazil lags the world, right? So Brazil is way behind the balance of the world when we're talking about the densities in the
phones. So even if they slowly catch up, our densities will go up.

And we're seeing improvements. When we look at the data in Brazil, I talked about the number of cell phones being sold and things like that, it's
turned the corner. They're starting to go up a little bit from where they were. So we're seeing unit growth in cell phones and in PCs down in Brazil.
It's turned a little bit on both -- demand for both is getting better down in Brazil.

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. And you couple that with just raw technology evolution that's going on globally. The memory requirement is going to get driven up because
of performance and expanded use of the platform in the hands of the consumer. So where Brazil may lag, it's eventually going to drive there and
things like 5G and other additional application drivers, we're going to be in a pretty good position to capture the advantage of the higher ASP
trend line.

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy from Rosenblatt Securities.

Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Semiconductor Research Analyst
Welcome, Mark. And also congratulations, Jack, on your promotion. But Jack, maybe I'll give you your first question then. On the Specialty Memory,
gross margins are -- seem to be stuck in the 16% range. Can you discuss that a little bit? Is there some opportunity to increase that gross margin?
What's the...

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Definitely opportunities to increase. No, I think you're seeing the gross margin for Specialty bottoming out here. We've had some new products
that have been qualified. And sometimes, when you qualify new products, you have a higher ASP product, which kind of translates into lower
margins. So we've had some impact on margins for that.

But our view is, going forward, as we go through next year to get to the back half of the year, specialty margins will definitely improve and get back
closer to where they have been historically. I think we're at the low area right now for specialty margins here in this quarter, maybe next quarter,
and they will start to improve again, Kevin.

Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Semiconductor Research Analyst
Okay. Are you thinking like back up to, say, 21% range? Or kind of...

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Yes. I think maybe the high teens and then slowly get up there, not get too excited. But...

Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Semiconductor Research Analyst
Okay. And how about the demand in the enterprise? Is it an inventory issue? Or kind of like what Mark said, is there some reporting that happened
early on and now you just have to let that inventory run down?

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Yes. I think -- I mean, you look at some of our customers, right? If you look at -- you follow some of our large customers in the space, right? They've
been guiding down what would be our Q1 for demand, right? Some of our largest customers are going to be guiding a little bit down in demand.
That's definitely going to impact the enterprise spend within Specialty Memory. I think they had built up some inventories maybe early in the
summer. And so the question is, it's a little bit of a demand issue, I think, on our customers, which translates back to demand issue for us as well.

Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities Inc., Research Division - Senior Semiconductor Research Analyst
Okay. Great. Congratulations on a good report for this environment.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.

Shek Ming Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
First of all, welcome aboard, Mark. I'll toss the first question to you. Maybe it's a little early, are there any changes in strategic direction, whether
there are areas that you want to focus more on or areas you want to deemphasize? And maybe related to that, there are some organizational
changes that you guys announced a few weeks ago. Can you talk about the importance of those changes?

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Of course. Maybe let me take the strategy. I think at this point, I would say that if you look across all of our businesses, SMART's strategy has been
to find markets where they can differentiate with delivering specialty solutions and to kind of a diverse set of end markets when you think about
the segments in high-performance computing versus the segments in Specialty Memory. Obviously, Brazil is unique in its own specialization of
capabilities that we have. And then you continue with the embedded and wireless businesses. So the common theme around developing specialty
solutions and subsystems is kind of at the core of what our strategy is.

Now as we've talked a little bit on this call, we want to make sure that we're developing additional capabilities to bring to our customers a lot of
differentiation. And that will kind of prompt us to look both organically on development, but also more strategically on expansion through inorganic
acquisition around both technologies and go-to-market opportunities.

And so from a strategy standpoint, it's not wildly different as I see it, at least not as I sit here today. But what I would say is the execution side of the
business, leveraging the operating platform and running the companies well, I think there's an opportunity there. I mean I am very bullish on
Penguin, yet over the last year or 2, Penguin hasn't really grown for us. I think there's a great opportunity with the right focus and energy to drive
that business to really a much better place on a go-forward basis. And the true -- same is true in our embedded and wireless business. And so some
of it is more about the execution side.

And then also, when you think about M&A, the platform that we have and the operating leverage that we have in terms of the low-cost operation
for specialty business is very unique, and I think that will give us the right platform to go out and acquire accretively and scale the business. And
the differentiation focus will maintain as we look at those type of opportunities. We're not looking just to grow a business to grow a business. We
want to find opportunities where we have market leadership and unique application end markets where there's enough differentiation that
leverages SMART's core competency around manufacturing, supply chain and go-to-market.

And so I don't think it's a broad strategy change as much as an emphasis on driving differentiation going forward above and beyond to allow us
to expand our margins because that's going to be a critical leg of the stool for us. Yes, we want to grow, but we want to grow while we expand
margins. That's the message I would like to give today, is that we're not exactly satisfied where the margins are, and we want to grow them, and
we want to find ways to grow them and providing more value. And I think our customers would like that, provided the value is tangible, and that's
going to drive the strategy.

Specific to the announcement, on a go-forward basis, as you guys know from my past, it's kind of very similar to what we did at Micron, where we
established these business unit mentalities. And I think from an accountability standpoint and a leadership standpoint, Jack has demonstrated
over his career that he will be the right person for this company to be able to win in the memory solutions business. And he's got the support of
an outstanding executive in KiWan that has really crafted a really strong business in Brazil.

And we believe that these leadership positions are well earned and reflect an organization structure, as we go forward, that we will have outstanding
leaderships at the top of these business areas. And we will continue to look for this type of leadership both inside the company and outside the
company to put the right team in place because as you might imagine, that's one of my highest priorities as an incoming CEO, is to make sure that
                                                                                                                                                                             
 we have the right leadership in place to drive these businesses. Because when you think of these opportunities at Penguin, for example, or other
businesses, managed services and the embedded business, as an example, these are new capabilities we're trying to establish.

And it's nice to be able to put them on a PowerPoint slide, but you got to go execute. And on the execute side, we have to have the right leadership
in place to build the right plans, develop the right capabilities and go-to-market. And as we think about the expansion capabilities in all of our
businesses, we want to have a Jack and KiWan clone across the whole set of businesses we're in and make sure we have the right leadership
development for our company. And that's where I'm going to be focused on a lot of in the next 60 to 90 days.

Shek Ming Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Great. Maybe moving on to the Specialty Compute business. I think last quarter, you guys talked about the commercial contracts where it was
generally pretty strong, maybe with a few pockets of weaknesses in terms of end markets. And in your prepared remarks, you talked about federal
business coming back a little bit, yet the fiscal Q4 results came in a little lower than I would have expected. So a few questions here. One, can you
give us some end market color? Is there -- was there any kind of negative surprises in terms of end markets? Second, do you have any visibility
when some of these federal contracts will come back after the initial pickup that you guys saw in August? And lastly, how should we think about
the mix between federal and commercial contracts in fiscal Q1 versus a normal environment?

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I'll take the second -- first part. The federal business per se for us has picked up a bit in terms of some major design wins and inbound orders. Having
said that, obviously, there's a lot of unknown in the government relative to the administration and what will happen in November. But what we
can see from our demand, that's an area of great opportunity for this company.

And so -- and I'll let Jack give a little more color on the specifics. But we're pretty bullish through the cycle because of some of the solutions we
have that are specifically -- and not just in one area. Certainly, Penguin is exciting, but also in terms of our embedded business, we've got some
design win opportunities that have come to fruition. And we're generally bullish. And again, with the hesitation that November may impact the
long-term progress, we just don't know. But we're following that, and we believe we can ride through that with some growth in that area.

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Yes. Back -- I think in Q4, the Penguin business performed as we thought it would. We didn't -- I think federal came in right where we thought. We
don't think it was weaker than we anticipated. And if you listen to Mark's statement, it would tell you that maybe in Q1, potentially a little stronger
than we thought, right? So Penguin will be probably doing a little bit better in Q1 than we had originally anticipated. So I think that some of the
business is popping back maybe a little sooner than we thought. So we're looking for a pretty good Q1 out of the Penguin group.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.

Blayne Peter Curtis - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst
It's actually a good lead in because I was just kind of curious, as you look to November, prior question asked about what the segments will be doing.
You said specialty would be good. You just said it would be up. I guess trying to square that with gross margin, which is down. And you would
think that if mix was moving to the Specialty Compute, the margin would be up. So can you just walk me through that?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
Sure. So again, the overall -- Specialty Compute, yes, we think that will be up. And you're right, that has a higher gross margin. But then we look at
-- in Brazil, the change with Brazil and all that. So Brazil will potentially be a little bit drag on the margins in Q1, where you'll see the margins come
down a little bit, Blayne, in the quarter potentially. But Specialty Compute will have -- will do better in Q1 and also help us on the margin side. But
Brazil, I think, Specialty Memory, a little bit, especially Brazil, will drive that margin down a little bit in the quarter.

Blayne Peter Curtis - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. So the accounting change is not fully implemented, is that way -- the right way to look at it? And therefore, you should see some benefit in
OpEx from it as well?

Jack A. Pacheco - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President of SMART’s Memory Solutions Business, COO & CFO
No, it's fully implemented. It's just that the Brazil business in Q1 based on some certain factors, we are anticipating lower margins in Q1. As we go
to market in the quarter, as we're driving volume down there, we expect margins to be impacted a little negatively in Q1 in Brazil.

Blayne Peter Curtis - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Director & Senior Research Analyst
Got you. And then I guess kind of a 2-part on the Brazil market. You mentioned densities as a driver. I'm just kind of curious, you had good growth
in Brazil. I mean there's unit story, there's density, and then there's kind of like just the strategic nature of how people use the credits and -- under
the new system and you're exiting batteries. So clearly, memory is the category that you have said people may use more, and that would drive
growth as well. So I'm just kind of curious, if you look at those factors over the last couple of quarters, what you think has driven the most part of
the growth. And then I guess, as you look out, are there any other segments -- you used to have wireless modules and batteries and other areas,
but is there any future areas that you could look at for Brazil? Or should we just continue to think about just memory?

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We commented in the earlier comments around 2 that we're pretty bullish around. One is around SSD development and IoT. We've actually been
in development of those products, and we're starting to get some early revenue traction. I believe SSD is an exciting opportunity for us given the
memory component in that, which makes us a very attractive product for in-country. And we're starting to work with our customers on developing
some scale in terms of getting share in their memory procurement in-country.

So I think SSD first. And then as we develop and cultivate some go-to-market capabilities around IoT, we'll be able to take some of that product
in-country as well. So I think where we found out over time that the battery business was a difficult one for us to scale and not as advantaged from
a local production standpoint, we think SSD and IoT are more so and that's where we're shifting our direction.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

Mark John Lipacis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Ajay, first of all, thank you very much for all the help, and Mark, congrats on the new role. I have 2 questions for Mark. First one, Mark, you started
to share a bit of your framework on M&A, and I was hoping you could maybe fill that out a little bit more. Can you talk about like your view on the
sweet spot in terms of the size of companies? And to the extent you have an appetite for exploring some kind of a transformative M&A deal, like
a merger of equals? Or are you thinking about tuck-ins and the willingness to lever up with debt or issue equity?

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Sure. So for those of you who knew me in a prior life, and then when you think about how Micron survived, we did 4 or 5 major acquisitions
in a 10-year period during some really turbulent times in the memory industry. And I would argue that those acquisitions and with the help of
some financial engineering, so to speak, to provide us the opportunity gave us a great platform that the company is built on. And obviously, Sanjay
and team have done a great job continuing the growth.

I think that the company, SMART, as we sit today, could really use some additional inorganic activity, M&A activity around tangential spaces to the
core business today, and so you've got compute, memory, embedded and areas of wireless. And so I don't think that the company should be
necessarily taking a transformative massive merger of equals approach at this point because I think there's a lot left to develop and add value to
our current businesses.

Having said that, adjacencies to what we do well, manufacturing of subsystems in specialty markets, well, those could be very interesting because
when you think of the holding company model at SMART, you've got these acquisitions that Ajay and team have already consummated. Penguin
and memory from a business standpoint, sure, they're overlapping in some areas, but from a go-to-market and customer set, not so much. And
these unique opportunities to deliver these products in individual expanding markets is where the growth can come from.

So I don't think necessarily a mergers of equal is necessarily what we'd be thinking about, just to answer to your question specifically. But I could
see some significant transactions in adjacent businesses that take advantage of our operating discipline and platform, again, the manufacturing,
supply chain expertise, go-to-market, support services, quality.

And as I think about that, there are a number of different industries that we should be exploring that have the same type of criteria that has made
these businesses successful at SMART. Again, the criteria I look for are specialty solutions at defendable differentiated end markets that require
really good operating discipline, and those 3 criteria for me is what's SMART has been built upon. And I think there's more of those opportunities
out in the industry and again, adjacent industries that allow us to take advantage of our capabilities and the competencies that we have today,
but yet expand our reach into new markets.

That's very helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. On Penguin, it looks like there's a view that there's an opportunity for improving the profitability. I
believe you mentioned developing a software application layer capability. And I was wondering to what extent have you explored -- or do you
think that hosting services yourself or providing the CapEx yourself, investing in the system yourself and offering that as a solution also, does that
enter into the...

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I apologize. I didn't a good job of calling that out. Sorry about that earlier. When I was referring to software and services, the services part of the
business really was a comment based on our desire to develop POD, P-O-D, Penguin On Demand, as an enhanced business growth driver for the
company, and it's a very unique business for us. But when you think about what would go on in that type of service platform, it'd be high-power
compute capabilities, coupled with advanced memory technology and storage. Well, those are all those assets we have in terms of the integration
and high-performance are under the roof of SMART today.

And so what it takes for, though, as I said earlier about skill set and leadership, we're going to need to make sure we have the plans in place and
the right team in place to go off and execute that. What I've seen in prior lives in larger companies is these great ideas don't necessarily pan out as
quick as you like them because they lose focus. And my commitment to the Board and my focus on a go-forward basis is an opportunity like that,
we staff it well, we get the right team in place, and we go into these businesses. And I think that is a good example of a great opportunity that we
have to flesh out a good plan, which I believe there is, and get the right team in place to go execute and allow them to go run and execute. And
                                                                                                                                                                             
 software and solutions services around things like POD or layered software on top of the Penguin architecture, those are capabilities that we will
invest in to grow the margin.

Operator
At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mark Adams, CEO, for closing remarks.

Mark W. Adams - SMART Global Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, operator. In summary, fiscal 2020 has concluded on a strong note amidst these challenging times. We are grateful for the outstanding
work of our employees across the globe, and I'm optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead. With a strong balance sheet, multiple growth
vectors and differentiated portfolio of technologies, I believe we are in an excellent position to drive growth both organically and through
opportunistic and accretive M&A in the next phase of SMART's evolution. Thank you for your interest in and support of the company, and I look
forward to meeting and working with you in the months ahead.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.

PRESENTATION
Marcin Czyczerski - CCC S.A. - President of the Management Board, CEO & CFO
I'd like to welcome you all very cordially. We would like to apologize for these small technical problems. In just a second, we'll have translation into
English. Because of your time allotment, I'm going to allow myself to go ahead and begin. So I understand that the translation is live now. So we
can go onto the presentation.

We'd like to present to you 3 time perspectives. So we have a large number of challenges. We had the lockdown, negotiations with the banks. And
then in second quarter, we started to rebuild our sales and then we are looking for the prospects for Q4 and for the entire 2020 and 2021. So we
can say the material is hot off the presses. So I would like to ask you to take a look at our disclaimer when you have a little bit of time.

And so we have 2 scopes of data. So we have the interim financial statements which we will speak to a little bit more. It was rather complicated
because of the large number of changes in the lease contracts and the utilization of IFRS 16. We also wanted to show you the ongoing results of
Q3, and that's how today's agenda is set up.

On top of that, we're going to look at what's happening in eobuwie. And we have selected speakers who will participate both during the presentation
stage as well as during the Q&A stage in order to enable -- to allow you to understand where we are at CCC.

So let me go ahead and look at the key factors that influenced Q2, Q3. When we talk about our [narration] over the 6 months that have passed, so
looking at the beginning of the period, we have the pandemic, the lockdown. But you've already heard about this from us many -- multiple times
as well as from other players, so I assume that you're asking yourselves the questions, how is CCC getting out of the situation?

And this is something that we're going to want to tell you about in the upcoming slides in a composite fashion, as succinctly as possible, so in terms
of how are we dealing with the situation, how are we coping with it and what CCC is becoming, what does this foretell in the future. And so we
want to talk about some of the key issues and address them directly related to results, some of the achievements that we've been able to achieve
in Q2 and Q3.

So first, one thing that we said from the very first day of the crisis, we've said it to you as well, but we're planning to convert this profound crisis for
the company, the economy and the nation -- I mean the economy and the nation. We want to utilize this to the greatest extent possible. And thanks
to this approach that we've adopted, we've been able to improve the rate of growth of e-commerce. We've been able to improve what we've been
doing up until now. We've been able to turn these challenges into opportunities. It's not just, well, COVID, of course, has affected of course our
e-commerce, but as a result of good decisions made in this environment where we are that have enabled us to attack correctly through this phase.

So the next issue is the rapid rebuilding of sales after the lockdown. So the rate of growth of e-commerce, combined with working on conversion
in our stores, stemming primarily from the fact that we've been able to improve our products but also the service we give to our customers, the
technical solutions. And so the conversion that we've been able to achieve means that we've been able to rebuild quickly post-lockdown. And
we've reachieved levels of sales that we wanted to have.

And so this rapid growth of e-commerce, coupled with the rigorous cost discipline and being effective in terms of our procurement means that
we've been able to improve our profitability in e-commerce during the period that we have now put behind us. The next thing is focusing on the
most important things. This is something that we have stated in our strategy, in Central and Eastern Europe online, our client-centric organization
with product being the main focal point.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And this is something that's happening. It's transpiring. We want to show that to you today. The effect, the outcome is that we've said goodbye to
the past. So we closed unprofitable and nonstrategic operations like the daughter company in Switzerland or what was happening in Germany as
well as sponsoring. So we're looking at -- look at the future. And so we've removed that from our balance sheet. And so you are certainly asking
yourselves the question, how does this turn into numbers? What the figures look like and what do those figures really mean? What do we want to
show your -- draw your attention to?

The fact is that CCC is an online channel model. It has a strong e-commerce demand. So 82% of the growth was in revenues, on online; and 50%
share of e-commerce. So as you can see, 64 sales platforms in e-commerce where we have different geographies, different signs. And so this is
something that's unprecedented in our industry. We have those large number of interactions with our customers. And this shows very strongly
how we are moving in the omnichannel approach.

What do Q2 financial results look like having in mind the other factors that took place? So one of the challenges we faced in this presentation of
the interim financial statements for us and CCC as well as the chartered accountant, the statutory auditor, was to show the continued and discontinued
operations, having in mind, (inaudible) and then looking at the provisions as a result of taking out of the operations of the company, the nonstrategic
operations.

So as you look at our financial statements, you should have in mind 4 different approaches. So Q2 has been reported in the financial statements.
So we have minus PLN 283 million EBIT in terms of the discontinued operations. But if we think about the future periods and how we're going to
-- without any provisions, we won't have any new provisions because we've set up all the provisions that we need to do and wanted to. And so in
Q2, we had a PLN 41 million EBIT in Q2. And this really shows what the base of the company is for the upcoming quarters in the future.

So the decision about Vögele, so you've been involved in our decision from the very beginning. In 2018, we entered Switzerland and we had a very
simple assumption that we're changing the procurement. Hence, we want to achieve the first margin -- gross margin, and then we would convert
this company that was unprofitable, generating a loss of CHF 7 million, and so we would restructure it, in terms of centralizing processes and
reducing costs.

So the second aspect did more for -- we did better there but we had unexpected challenges. COVID is an additional factor in 2020. And so in line
with the strategy that we are doing, a review of our strategic options, and so we made the decision that we're going to begin the process to sell
that asset and reclassify Vögele in Switzerland. We are going to consider this part of discontinued operations. And that's the result. That's why we
have this result in the financial statements.

So as a management team, what are we going to think about and focus on in the upcoming quarters? This is the message we would like to convey
to you during today's presentation. During the subsequent portion of the presentation, we're going to talk about our business, net of -- or having
Vögele removed from that.

So if you look at the results, we only had an additional 6,000 added square meters. So quite modest compared to what we had said in the strategy
and having in mind the post-COVID world. And so above all, if we look at our hybrid stores, eobuwie, which have performed very well, and we also
have MODIVO which is a fashion store. And so this is something that is worthwhile to pay attention to in Q2.

So the fact that we haven't grown the space selling area for Russia, that means above all from today, we're working on and focusing on performance,
conversion, footfall. So the traffic, upgrading our products constantly to make sure that we can utilize the base we have today as best as possible.
And so one of the elements that will enable us to offset the lockdown or lower traffic -- and this is something that was taking place in Q2, this is
e-commerce. I'm going to speak to you more -- quite a bit more about e-commerce today.

But if we look at the graph that you see on the left side, so the closures of stores, over 5 weeks and 10 weeks for the maximum case with traffic
down by 60% to 80% meant that there wasn't much that could be done in terms of sales. Nevertheless, we've been able to do quite well because
we planned a path to follow post-lockdown. And that means that our growth rate was higher than the rest of the market, but e-commerce growth
of 82% in Q2 really lifted us up.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so I would like to say, and I've been talking about this since Q2 2019, this was the first time I said to you about this in September. If you look
above the green color, you can see the new channels of sales, Internet channels, the ones that we launched then after months of implementation
work. And now this now represents some 25% of our e-commerce top line of revenue. This is a very important part of our group. So today, CCC of
course has eobuwie in terms of e-commerce. This is the flagship brand. And we want to -- we're betting on our e-commerce engines, but Karol
Poltorak will talk about that a little bit later.

And so if we look at the results of eobuwie as the main driver of the engine here, so the growth rate is impressive compared to the competitors
from Western Europe or in any of the markets we could speak to. We have a high gross margin as a result of being able to procure products very
effectively with a good set of margins.

This is how we see this as the mother company. We've got wonderful cost discipline, and so this is with respect to marketing. And we have very
good decisions and performance of the management team there at eobuwie in terms of logistics and growth. And all this taken together means
that the share of costs in the percentage of costs or cost as a percentage of revenue are falling. And so the EBITDA is growing.

You asked us whether or not eobuwie is going to improve its profitability, and so we can come back with an affirmative response on that. With
respect to that question, if we look at the results of the group, starting with gross margin -- so we've already talked about eobuwie. If we look at
the retail margin, it was down by roughly 5 percentage points. And this is a result of the sales of the collection assets, which was only happening
through around half of the period, half of the quarter, so spring and summer. And so we had very low traffic.

And perhaps you remember the pictures from the beginning of May, when there were lines in front of our stores. We were able to achieve that
result. But we had to consume a bigger portion of our gross margin to encourage people to visit our stores. But then for subsequent seasons, we
have more room in the shelves for spring and summer 2021. So the company is going to have better and better products month-on-month,
quarter-on-quarter. So in total, that gross margin is down quarter-on-quarter but the delta is in line with our preliminary expectations for Q2, if we
look at this below the gross margin, if we look at operating expenses.

So we had said to you, perhaps you remember, that the company is going to use an axe to slash costs at every level of the cost accounts. And this
is what we did. And we said that we were going to deliver PLN 100 million in savings. We've done a little bit more than that. At the very level of our
P&L, we have specific achievements in terms of lease expenses, payroll, others. We talked with our partners at the same time. We took pains to
make sure that the company would be able to navigate these waters with as dry a leg as possible.

And so you're probably asking the question, well, as you look at this -- so something might be wrong because we've got red for e-commerce. And
this has been the case for some 12 quarters. We have to remember that these costs are nearly variable -- 100% variable, totally driven by top line.
Sub costs grew by 47%, whereas, the top line grew by 82%. So you can say that we've improved greatly our operating leverage.

So a very interesting observation can be drawn from what's happening with our costs, if you measure them against square meters. So if you measure
it on a square meter basis, they've fallen by some 34%, and the cost of store functioning fell by 45%. Very hard to imagine that we could maintain
a cost level of PLN 98 per square meter, but I can't imagine that we're going to go back to PLN 174 per square meter as the cost of our store
functioning.

So if we try to take a look at this at the P&L statement, which brings everything together. And so you can look at this in a variety of fashions. So you
can look at the history and think about what's happening with the provisions, which basically addresses the fact that we're saying goodbye to
some of our past decisions.

You can look at our operating results after you adjust it for the provisions, how the company looks like operationally. And as I said, in Q2, we have
an operating result EBIT of PLN 41 million. And so if we look at this and compare this to comparable entities, our peers, they also look at the results
cleansed of the past events. And so the provisions we talked about were priority pertains to discontinued operations in Switzerland and Germany
as well as the write-downs of possibly unprofitable stores. And then looking at the income from sponsoring and so all of these provisions have
been prepared and described in great detail, I think, on -- in the backup section, I think it's Slide 98.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so if you look at, first, the response to some of your questions, what sort of stock will you retain? What are you going to do with your stock?
Well, we've been able to do quite well, let me say. And this next slide really speaks to that. Despite the lockdown, despite the fall in footfall, because
of the change in approach to management of inventories. And thanks to the fact that we were able to act very quickly, sometimes aggressively,
we made some strategic decisions and we conducted ourselves in line with our strategy. So now we're able to rotate our inventory much better.

So lockdown and COVID, to some extent, choked us in terms of sales, but we were able to optimize inventory to -- square meters were down to
around PLN 2,000. e-commerce is in the Internet, and it's not measured against, of course, selling space in stores. So the e-commerce shows some
potential. Of course, the inventory is rising, but again, we have the 82% increase in top line. And so we can say the economics of that business are
improving. And so having in mind how quickly we're able to sell and the challenges we had, so you can say that we've been able to sell quite a bit.
And we're waiting for even better collections in our shelves, in our e-commerce stores. So we've been able to improve the turnover of inventory.

So if we look at liabilities or payables, it's a little worse because of the post-COVID extinguishing of payables, maintaining relations with suppliers
and vendors for them to be able to deliver subsequent collections. So we can say the loss in Poland, which makes it difficult for us to finance
ourselves with trade credit. So we can say we don't have the same effect that we had in the past about working on working capital, but we can
assure you that as conditions normalize, we'll continue to work on that.

Some of the other areas are impacted by COVID, and we've listed some of these CapEx items a little bit later not just because of COVID. But a lot
has been done in the past quarters prior to COVID, and we're starting to implement that.

So if we look at the debt of the company, so our net debt is a little over PLN 1 billion, at PLN 1.083 billion. So we have a stable position in terms of
factoring lines, lines of credit, cash. We've been able to do very well. We have some pretty good days now. So the situation looks pretty well.

So we want to continue working on conversion, and we want to sell more of our stock. And so we believe that subsequent quarters will continue
to improve. We have talked with PFR, National Development Fund (sic) [Polish Development Fund], as well as the banks. We want to prepare
ourselves for a variety of scenarios. And we want to treat this basically as a type of safety cushion for us.

So we should say, bid adieu to the past, the distant past because we're thinking about what's happening in April and May. And these months are
committed to our memory. And it was an unprecedented period so it will be in our minds for many, many periods to come. And not only in the
industry, but -- not only in this country, but globally. But I would propose to look at the past, that's not so far back, which is basically the third
quarter.

So basically, we've been able to sustain the high rate of growth in online. We have another 2 sales platforms in our online portion of our business.
The group is in the black. In Q3, we were fighting quite strongly to be at least at breakeven. We've been able to -- we're back in the black. And so
as you can see, July, August and September show you a very positive trend as we emerge from the crisis, measuring sales versus last year.

One of the leading players at the global level showed a similar graph, they had 89% in July. And in August, they were enthusiastic that they've been
able to regain their revenues even though they were below [1%]. We're quite a bit better. And we know that it could be even better. There are
certain things that we could have done even better, and we're starting to do them better now and we'll do them better in upcoming months.

I think we should take a look at the breakdown, the composition of the mix of our revenue. The delta in off-line is smaller and smaller. So that means
that online continues to show a very high rate of growth. And this means that the overall group is able to build its -- rebuild its sales year-on-year.
So there's a big difference between e-commerce and retail. You can see how much the retail business, walk-in business has lost, has shrunk, while
e-commerce has grown quite strongly.

So we can see there's an additional wind that's blowing the sales of e-commerce. If we look at detail -- retail business, we still have traffic that's
down by a number in the teens. Of course, the footfall, the traffic is improving. And we can see the most recent days and weeks have been very
good for us. But the delta for the overall group in terms of gross margin, this delta is gradually narrowing. And so the contribution made by
e-commerce is not only eobuwie, but we have other brand names: MODIVO, Gino Rossi, DeeZee, CCC.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So if we look at the top line and we look at the other elements in the P&L statement. You can see that we had roughly PLN 1.5 billion in revenue in
Q3, a little bit better. And so we can say that gross margin is pretty much flat, which is not something that was obvious, having in mind the pandemic.
We had thought that there would be a bigger delta here. And so the operating result is where it is. And so we don't have any provisions in Q3.

And so this is more or less the results picture in terms of costs. And if we look at something that's growing the fastest, so e-commerce. And so Karol
Poltorak will say a few words about that. And so Karol is responsible in the group for e-commerce development and our omnichannel model of
growth and development.

So Karol, go ahead, I'll give you the floor.

Karol Poltorak - CCC S.A. - Vice-President of Management Board
Thank you very much. Marcin has talked to us about the results of e-commerce. Let's try and take a look from the inside, what we're focusing on
as a group when we think about CCC and DeeZee. And then Marcin Czyczerski will say a few words about eobuwie.

So you can see on this slide, we're only showing a small bit of what's happened in the first half of the year. And in fact, in Q3 as well. The most
important message we want to convey, I think, is as follows: we are coming closer and closer to that point in time that we will be able to say more
than half of our sales will be generated through e-commerce. This is something that's going to be a fixed attribute, this is something that's a strategic
objective. And this is something that we're going to be guided by in the future.

So if we come to CCC. And from the point of view as a sales network and our clients, we focus above all on building an omnichannel approach and
a good experience, user experience for our clients. We received some distinctions from a chamber which shows that we've been able to achieve
quite a bit in the last 12 to 18 months when the omnichannel world and CCC was born.

So in Q2, we were busy to react to the unplanned situation. And we were able to handle the spike in demand and make those deliveries to customers.
So nobody was well-prepared amongst the e-commerce retailers to handle all of that, but we did pretty well. Now we're in Q3 and Q4. And the
most important thing, of course, is what's happening right now. So in Q3 and Q4 we're going to implement more and more digital into our stores.

So Internet, kiosks, sometimes we call them esize.me kiosks. And so in some stores, they account for 10% of the sales. So that's a very big chunk of
the business. There are stores that are very well aware, and they're tapping into these tools. And we want to -- as we benchmark our stores, we
want to pull up our lower-performing stores into that for them to embrace these channels and these tools. So we have -- so we want to go abroad
as soon as possible. So we have some 200 of our stores that are already following this approach. We want to generate pretty big margins and
convert traffic, really give our staff the ability to provide telephone-based support and it is something that we'll roll out in the near future.

And so our customers can order products with assistance of our staff members and to order that delivered directly to home. And by the end of the
year, we'd like to complete the pilot. So there's quite a bit of digital work in here, even more digital. But it's not just a gadget, but something that
actually does its job and generates sales.

So through our mobile application, we're actually accelerating downloads and the number of users who have our app on their phones. So we had
some 600,000 downloads. We've launched the app last year. So we had 600,000 in the first half of the year. And during the 3 months of Q3, we had
another 600,000 downloads, so that suggests acceleration. Of course, there are some new countries here as well, but the distribution of our app
to our client base is accelerating and not decelerating. So we'll soon bypass the 3 million mark and look at 4 million as the watermark. So it's generally
younger clients, the more demanding clients, and this is something that we're quite pleased with because strategically, we are counting on them.

So we would like this to be a tool for our customers to do at least half of their transactions in terms of our digital sales, e-commerce sales. Right
now, we're probably around 20%, 25%. That's something we'd like to double. That's our plan. And we'd like for our app to give broader interactions
with our customers, more profound interactions with our customers. And that means we'll be able to have more frequent contact. Not necessarily
every contact has to turn into a transaction, but having that more frequent contact, it doesn't cost us anything. That's something that's going to
be quite important.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so we're adding social media in some of the content. So basically, we're distributing content to put in front of the eyes of our clients. In terms
of e-commerce in the most recent quarter, we can see that Poland is more developed. This is where we focused to the greatest extent.

In September, we're -- it's nearly 20% of the sales in stores. Prior to COVID, we had stated an objective. We wanted to get to 22%. And the future is
now. And so we want to focus on this more strongly to ensure that we're going to be able to achieve those levels elsewhere, the ones that we have
here in Poland.

So if you remember our strategy prior to COVID, we do observe, and this trend has continued, that the e-commerce with a multichannel customer
is generating 50% more revenue for us than a customer we're able to serve only through our store. So this is a challenge. And so we have 5 million
people in our CCC Club who haven't bought a single time through our e-commerce.

Of course, we're not going to be able to convert everybody, but most of us believe that over time, that people are going to start doing that -- doing
their shopping through their phone or their computer. It doesn't really matter there, but we want to pull them into the digital world with the
deliveries to the home with an easy path to make returns in the stores, customers love that. And so we'd like to be able to see that we're earning
an additional 50% step-up in terms of our top line.

What else might be important here? If we think about our customers, we're preparing some really nice things for them in Q4 and Q1 of next year.
We're going to change basically, our sort of front -- web front. So it will be much nicer.

We will have even more refined elements of esize.me. We would like for people to be able to play with that, share that image and to be able to
buy, do shopping for others, buy people's shops because the scan of shoe size is something that could be shared amongst customers. And we'd
like to have more availability of various sizes for customers from the stores to the customers. And same day of deliveries, and this is something that
we'd like to show to customers as an added benefit, greater selection, product selection, greater than we have right now in e-commerce.

Gift cards, there are a large number of things that we want to do, and we want to exceed that 23 -- 20% threshold and break through it in the
omnichannel approach. So we're not dividing this into e-commerce and other things. We can say it's at the omnichannel. That's the most important
thing.

And so we can see that quite a bit of e-commerce is happening in the space of the stores themselves. We're also working on the customer base.
We want to have another club or new rules for the club. We want to use a smaller discount. We want to give other values to customers for this to
be even more attractive. It should be an attractive proposal for customers, but something that should be much less expensive to CCC. That's what
I wanted to say about CCC.

If we look at DeeZee, we should mention that this is an incredible platform to develop the DeeZee brand. Right now, it's growing. It's doubling top
line year-on-year. We have apparel there. And we want to convert it and develop it, cultivate it into a mature brand with the full range of clothing,
something that would be -- that would appeal to customers in Poland as well as abroad. And so it will take on additional mass, something like a
snowball as it gathers momentum.

And so I would go ahead and give the floor now maybe to Marcin Czyczerski, who will say a few more words about eobuwie, the main e-commerce
arm within the group.

So perhaps I'll fill in some space between the 2 periods. So if we look at Q3, we can continue to see very rapid growth, 51% and wonderful cost
discipline. And we have the progress in terms of procurement value generated. We see the potential here.

So Marcin will say some more about that because nobody knows this business better than he does.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Marcin Czyczerski - CCC S.A. - President of the Management Board, CEO & CFO
So I'd like to welcome all of you, ladies and gentlemen. So we've been building size and profitable growth for years. So we've become the leader
in the CEE area. And we have selectively emphasized our footprint in various countries of Europe. And through our procurement, we want to
improve the customer experience, inspire our customers, make sure that we have the right marketplace. We want to augment our content, the
filters we use on our websites and to make sure that it's even easier to have good contact with our brands. So omnichannel applications,
personalization, communication. We want to loyalize our customers to an even greater extent.

So as a leader here in eobuwie, we want to increase our presence in the premium segment through MODIVO. So consistently and unwaveringly,
we've been building our magnitude, business size since 2006 when we launched operations. So then in 2012, 2013, we saw some competition
coming out of the market without improving the scale very quickly, looking at Zalando.

So we decided to go and enter foreign markets. That's something we saw in 2012. So we entered Czech Republic in 2013. Then the 2016 was when
we received the support from CCC because it took over a 75% equity stake. That year, we were able to exceed 1 million orders a year. Then in
subsequent years, we penetrated new markets. We penetrated them.

The next milestone was 2018, when we launched our first hybrid stores. And then we also launched the esize.me service, which was a revolutionary
service and a breakthrough moment, and then we started to enter subsequent Western European markets. And then in 2019, we had a major
investment, the biggest in the history of the company for a new logistics center, and it's very important for the growth of the business.

And so in 2020, we had to store some of the products. And so then we opened up a new segment for us, which is MODIVO. This is apparel and we
were able to increase substantially the size of the market where we're operating. And so in 2020, we opened up MODIVO hybrid stores. And we
started to utilize our new logistics center, which, at the turn of Q1 and Q2 of 2020, started to do distributions.

Then we entered the corporate period. We had a large number of constraints, safety. We had to change a lot of things. We had to have a new store,
technological solutions were out and deployed. And as Karol mentioned, there were a lot of impediments we had to overcome. And as a result,
there were some delays in the deliveries. But now after a few months, we're delivering all of our consignments more quickly than we did prior to
having the essential warehouse. And so had -- we now have these impediments, the results would have been even better.

So this year, we're very pleased and proud of being able to launch the esize.me app on smartphones. We're no longer dependent solely on physical
infrastructure. We're able to deliver the scan through a smartphone.

So over the last 7 years, we've been able to increase revenue some 60x. We've been growing very dynamically, very rapidly. And so this rapid growth
is taking place in line with the profitability of the company, which is something that's totally extraordinary across the globe.

So eobuwie has not had to raise any additional capital. So we've grown basically, organically through this period. So we started in Poland where
we're the top player, but we've grown in other markets. So Poland accounts for 39% of sales even though we've grown by some 50% nearly from
2016 to 2019.

In CEE, which is a key market to us, we are the leader there. We want to continue strengthening our footprint here. So the growth has been quite
strong here, some 76%. In Western Europe, it represents 18% of our sales, but the growth here from 2016 to 2019 is nearly 230%. The Greek market
is a very good example. We started our expansion in Greece in 2017. And in 2019 we are the leader there on the distributed market, and we have
a market share of some 17%. So we've selectively chosen markets in Western Europe where we want to strengthen our position. We see enormous
potential to continue growing our business.

The success of eobuwie is linked to the fact that the customer experience and during the purchasing process and generally, satisfaction are quite
important to us. So we have new initiatives, new projects and new solutions that we're working on.

One of the good examples are hybrid stores. We have some 25 stores. So we want to focus on utilizing the capacities, the capabilities these stores
give us to deliver products to customers within 3 hours. And we want to open ourselves up to new solutions.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so we have the first MODIVO store. And what we're proud of is the MODIVO project where we've been able to look at premium apparel. We're
pleased with the project. We're growing there quite rapidly, and we have some 560 brands. So 200 brands with apparel. And then we have a large
number of our own brands. So we're very pleased with our logistics system and the modern logistics we can offer.

We're able to deliver 95% of our consignments this very same day. And with respect to 14 countries, we're able to deliver packages within 48 hours.
The new logistics center makes that possible. We're utilizing the most advanced, sophisticated technical solutions there, another important service
that's quite important to us, and it enables us to give good recommendations to our customers.

We have the esize.me app, you know that, I'm pretty sure. As a result, we have some 300 scanners, 3D scanners in our stores. That means, along
with CCC, we were able to amass a database of some 1.3 million customers. So that increases the value of a customer because the sales conversion
is more than double. And so most of the products are available on eobuwie.pl and are available to our customers.

We're investing in our app. And so we have nearly 1 million people who've downloaded the app. A large number of those people are utilizing
mobile devices over the course of the last year. Our website has been visited. We had 590 million visits with (inaudible) by 1 million active customers
up until June of this year. So a little bit more than 9 million orders. The average value of the orders of MODIVO and eobuwie is around PLN 290 (sic)
[PLN 349].

And here, you can see a picture of our modern logistics center. As I mentioned, it's the largest investment in the history of eobuwie, more than PLN
200 million that we've invested in this logistics center. Most of the costs have already been incurred because we built all the infrastructure. We
purchased orders. We had all the technology that was key to us for dispatching consignments. So we can expand the center, the warehouse by
another bit. It's going to be much less expensive.

So in these expenditures, we purchased land as well for subsequent expansion if it proves to be necessary. So this investment makes it possible to
look into the future with a great amount of optimism, and we'll be able to scale up our operations as we respond to market needs.

We're growing rapidly. So our CAGR from 2017 to 2019 is more than 50% in the first half of the year, we're up some 58%. If you look at the first half,
so it was up the previous years, so we've been able to improve our gross margin. In 2019, it was 49%. So 42 -- now it's 43%. So even though there's
been a rough period, rough patch in the first half of the year with COVID, we've been able to improve our gross margin.

If you look at our EBITDA, so in 2019, it was 7%. We've been able to increase it by some 11%. Our CAGR has improved by 11% from 76 to 94. And
so there's quite a bit of costs in MODIVO, but we were able to grow this business anyway. We've invested quite a bit in technology, in new applications,
and I'll say a few words about this in just a moment, as a result of what happened on the marketplace. So the emergence of the pandemic, we have
noticed, of course, negative impacts primarily in March.

It was a tough period branches for our shoe industry, but from many industries, we're able to achieve some 70% growth. And then we saw in April
growth growing by leaps and bounds in shoes and that we were able to catch up in subsequent months for what happened in March. So we see
much greater interest amongst customers in online shoes but also looking at apparel. And this means it's going to be possible for us to maximize
our position on the market. As I've mentioned, COVID means that the penetration of online versus off-line has increased quite strongly.

2020 is an exceptional year, so we're not going to show our analysis here because many stores were closed or they had substantial reductions in
footfall. So we believe that many people who made their first purchases online will stick with us. And the penetration we've seen in 2020 will
increase by at least 5 percentage points. So we assume that they'll be able to work with us for the next couple of years, in fact. So this gives us an
-- to estimate future opportunities. And so we'll be able to surpass our top line growth sales as well as our profitability objectives for 2020.

Basically, I'd like to triple the size of our business compared to 2019. And so next year, we'd like to have an EBITDA of PLN 230 million, PLN 250
million, having achieved additional financing.

So we have MODIVO, we have the hybrid stores. These are the things that we've done in the past, now we want to monetize all of these investments.
One of the key initiatives to bring us closer to attaining the objectives I've mentioned, this is accelerating the e-commerce market growth as a result

                                                                                                                                                                             
 of COVID. And so we want to continue developing MODIVO in the premium segment to enable us to operate in a much broader market. We want
to develop the overall marketplace. As I indicated, we -- the large number of suppliers we would like to work with us is through this marketplace
and this would make it possible for us to expand our product offering without having to commit working capital to that.

And then we have personalization, not just communication. We'd like to loyalize our customers to an even greater extent and improve retention.
As a result of having MODIVO on board, we've been able to increase retention. We want to continue developing mobile solutions as well as our
apps. And then the effectiveness of our logistics because we have this investment made in our logistics. And so we're able to send out orders to
customers even more quickly. And so the unit costs of these type of operations has fallen substantially. We're making investments in new systems,
which means that we're going to be able to operate more effectively.

Then we have our own solution, which we're utilizing in 9 markets for MODIVO. And we intend to roll out this system in the Polish market. We're
very pleased with how this new system is operating. So next year, we also intend to roll out this technology for eobuwie.pl, which would enable
us to achieve many other initiatives and projects where we would be able to step up the acceleration of their onboarding.

And so on top of everything I've mentioned, we need to have the proper capital base. We'd like to attract some PLN 400 million to achieve all of
these objectives. And so along with the shareholders, we're analyzing all of the possible scenarios. And when the decisions are made, then of
course, we'll advise you -- for CCC to be able to announce what the directions we intend to follow are.

So thank you very much for your attention.

Unidentified Company Representative
Okay. Thank you very much, Marcin. So I think this is a big chunk of information, interesting information, to sum up the performance of eobuwie.
Perhaps, this might sound a little bit odd in your ears. Things could have been even better with the growth rate and the profitability, even though
things were very good.

So if you look back at March and April, eobuwie was starting its biggest investment, it was automating things. And all of this was happening during
-- while being in the storm's eye as suppliers weren't able to come here. And it all had to be integrated. So a big portion of the year had to be
canceled. And so it had to be -- I mean, the things that were supposed to be done this way were done manually. So we had additional costs as a
result. So these are things that you will see in the future.

So Marcin, I'd like to thank you for this portion of the business. We (inaudible) a very dynamic quarter behind us. In Q2 and Q3, we're very pleased
with the progress in this channel. We're also pleased with how we're dealing with the rebuilding of revenue after the lockdown during the pandemic.

The gray shows our budgetary -- revised budgetary assumptions incorporating the COVID reality. You said that our results were too optimistic and
they should have been more pessimistic. Well, perhaps we were aided by fortune. We were also prepared. There's a large number of good, solid
decisions.

So the orange bars show that we're doing better than the optimistic scenario that we had embraced at that time. And this gives us a good foothold
for the upcoming 3 months. And Q4 is the most important period. And so the company is entering Q4, very well prepared in terms of its products,
in terms of its process and in terms of the equity it holds.

We're convinced that the work we've done during COVID, the work that we talked about in our strategy, addressing the commerce, the product
assortment, the customer approach, the awareness of how customers are changing - all this would generate value into the future. We can see this
based on our own research, but also based on third-party research that COVID has strengthened the trends that we talked about in our strategy.

So it's a truism to talk about e-commerce becoming stronger. It's a big part of our strategy. So I'm pleased to hear what Karol and Marcin are saying,
that we continue to deliver and what we promised in previous quarters, and now we're monetizing those projects, and we'll do that in the future.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So then we have the improved popularity of sneakers. We're also investing in our own brand here. There were some difficulties that we encountered
here. So as a group -- so Q3 could have been even better.

And so we have more price sensitivity and the quality to price ratio is very important. So 93% of our customers -- 93% believe that it's an attractive
price. And so we see consumers are more and more aware of CSR. We're proud that we're the top entity. We have an A rating in the ESG ratings of
MSCI.

So I think we're -- so if we go to the recap, where we are today, and what are the connotations for our future? So let me begin with the end. Let me
emphasize, this is the most important thing. Our collection has been very well received. So this first capsule sold out in the first 2 weeks. We've got
very good relations with our customers. We have very high NPS scores. And so we can say that we have a lot of achievements in e-commerce.
COVID is blowing at our sales, but this is something that was a result of the hard work that we did and the smart business decisions made in previous
quarters and years.

If you look at e-commerce plus our product plus the work on conversion means that we've been able to rebuild our top line much more quickly
than we had originally posited and much more quickly than many of our peers. So this means that the e-commerce channel is very profitable. And
the -- we can say that the brick-and-mortar section has an opportunity to rebuild some of its profitability, and we're focusing on sales density, so
sales per square meter.

So these are things that we communicated to you previously. We don't want to focus on nonstrategic, nonprofitable areas of our business. That's
why we made the decision to wrap up operations there, set up provisions, forget about sponsoring activity, our operations in Germany, in Switzerland,
and think about our product and our customers and product communication because these are things that are changing. We're becoming much
more precise and much more consistent. And so we're building our world of brands.

So we're trying to communicate what these brands are clearly and expressively like Lasocki which is a family and traditional brand that's all about
environmentally friendliness and long-term durability. And so then we have brands with different -- and aspirational brands for people who are
moving forward strongly. We're communicating this very strongly in Q3, and we're going to talk about this quite a bit. And you're going to hear a
lot about Deichmann and Jenny Fairy. It's not just (foreign language), it's not just about something that's Italian. It's a cosmopolitan approach. It's
classics and minimalism. It's compact. It's a clear message that we're delivering as a wonderful product and that's planned. That's something that
we've had around for a long time. So it's quite popular in the '90s. It started to sell very well.

As of June, we have some interesting ideas. So consistent communication, things that we want to maintain. Then DeeZee, glamor, always on time.
A timely brand for people, for women who are bold. And so we're working with some writers, top model. And so DeeZee has entered the world of
fashion. Then we have sneakers' personalization. So this is where the retail business is going, and we're building a community where we want to
be effective in the 21st century at the next collection. It is becoming part of the fashion world with the strong utilization of our showroom. And so
basically, we really are now a part of the fashion world. We feel that we're a good part of that, and CCC feels very good here and the fashion world
feels good with us at CCC.

Then we have the capsules. We want to have some of the unique aspects of our products of fashion and fashion trends. We want to emphasize
them, and we want to show to customers some of the unique things in time and giving customers very specific feelings and experiences.

This is how CCC is changing. And it's becoming -- it's improving its reception amongst customers, its customer perception. And so you'll see that
in subsequent quarters and the results from this quarter.

Now I'd like to give the floor, traditionally, to the Chairman of our Supervisory Board, who is best at summing up past quarters. And he says the
kind of words that we remember, commit to memory best. Thank you very much.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Dariusz Milek - CCC S.A. - Chairman of the Supervisory Board
So perhaps, I would only add what Marcin talked about. Our CCC Group is a different company than a few quarters ago. We have more competent
people at every stage of projects and management. We've made some pretty important changes in e-commerce and retail business. Basically, we
have to change or die, we all know about that. We have much more product-aware approach in the marketing that we're doing there is -- I can tell
you, this is just the beginning of the change.

Every quarter, these changes are going to be more clear in terms of what we're thinking about in the spring, what we're thinking about in the fall.
A lot of changes have taken place in our procurement section. And I think these results are going to be a pretty clear monetization of these projects.

So we have made a large number of investments. So e-commerce, CCC, MODIVO, the app, the warehouse, the purchase of the DeeZee brand, the
Gino Rossi brand purchase or acquisition, the esize.me platform to measure foot size. This is very interesting. It didn't make money initially, but
these were investments.

So all these projects have started to monetize to a lesser or greater extent -- actually, to a greater extent. And we see that the potential is enormous.
And these are the type of effects that we should expect from these projects.

What's the most important thing to us? So focusing on e-commerce sales. We're all aware of how strongly this is moving forward. We want to
improve our sales density per square meter. So Q2, Q3 of next year, we'll see great improvement here. We have ideas on how to achieve that, and
we'll focus on product and product marketing. And so I think all of this is moving in a good direction in our company.

So thank you for your attention. So I'd like also to thank you for this summary and recap. So now ladies and gentlemen, we'll have the Q&A session.
So we would like to ask for the questions to be read aloud, the questions that are posted on the chat, and then we'll try to respond to them as best
as we can. So let's begin.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Unidentified Company Representative
Is the company ready for a potentially warm October?

Unidentified Company Representative
More than ever. We're much more a fashionable company than a company that's responding to specific needs. We're much more weather resistant.
That was the idea we had for many quarters. We can't be so susceptible to weather changes, we're much more fashionable. Well, maybe that doesn't
sound so nice, but we're trying to generate more emotions related to ourselves as opposed to just being weather-driven. Well, we also have good
weather. The weather seems to be pretty good. If we look in terms of October, the last couple of Octobers were very warm. This year, perhaps we're
going to have a little bit more fortune in terms of the weather in October. Thank you.

Unidentified Company Representative
Now we have a question about eobuwie. What about the IPO for the eobuwie? Because it's always been the pearl and your crown and I've thought
about that.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
So as I mentioned previously, we're analyzing a number of scenarios. The key thing for us is to source additional capital because we have additional
opportunities. Thanks to COVID, we want to tap into those opportunities in the various markets where we're present. And to do that, we need to
have the right equity base or capital base, and so we're analyzing a variety of scenarios. And so we'll advise you once those -- the decision is made.

Unidentified Company Representative
Let's stick with eobuwie. Can you give us a little bit more information about market place? What is planned here?

Unidentified Company Representative
It seems to me that it's a little premature to analyze specific details because the e-commerce market itself is evolving very rapidly. So many
competitors are doing types of promotional efforts in the marketplace. We've done some analysis. It should enable us to expand, enlarge the
product range without investing capital. We want to continue the investments in eobuwie and top of mind, in CEE, but also in other markets where
we're operating in West Europe such as Greece. And in this direction, the marketplace project is going to be one of the core elements for the
development here. So it's planned to launch in the latter half of next year. We see a lot of interest amongst our potential partners who are thinking
about and very interested in cooperating with our marketplace approach.

Unidentified Company Representative
Another question about pandemic. More and more people are talking about a second wave of the pandemic.

Unidentified Company Representative
While traffic is affected especially in the South below Poland, we haven't seen that in the top line of the company in recent weeks. Well, traffic is
proper for everybody. It's just for everybody. We focus on conversion.

Unidentified Company Representative
Have the stores in Switzerland already been shut down? So the model of leaving Switzerland is little bit different. We intend to sell that company.
We've started the preparation process. So we're restructuring the network there. We think at the time of sale, it will have around 100 stores. Perhaps
Karol can say a couple of words about this.

Karol Poltorak - CCC S.A. - Vice-President of Management Board
I would confirm that. So we want to build the value of that for the buyer. So this asset, the way it is, is ready for sale, but we continue the operations
that were launched previously, but the asset's ready for sale.

Unidentified Company Representative
Can you talk about the provisions? Which provisions relate to which lines of the P&L?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
I think the current report addresses that in detail. I think the simplest thing is to take a look at the current report on the subject. And it's number
58, where we've given a breakdown, information about which provisions on costs, some of the operational. There's a large number of financial
things. We mentioned which line items, which things we're writing down loans and things like that in Germany, Switzerland, already done, in some
places this year.

Unidentified Company Representative
What do you think the costs of running your stores will be per square meter in the upcoming period?

Unidentified Company Representative
We can say that they're going to be higher than 98 and lower than 174. But the post-COVID base will be built in the upcoming quarters. We see
cost discipline not just during COVID. The work was started prior to that. So I think our lease team along with the management team and the
Chairman, we've been able to negotiate very good terms. Well, a lot has changed, things have changed. We have to accept that and embrace it.
And so we've been able to find that understanding elsewhere. So the staff numbers are quite tight, and we're focusing on good customer service.
So we'd be pleased if things stay the way they are. So we're doing many things on our own, better than in the past. We've given them to partners.
So I think right now, we're trying to make sure that no single zloty is spent irresponsibly in the group.

Unidentified Company Representative
What was your level of inventory in payables? And what was your cash flow in Q3?

Unidentified Company Representative
Unfortunately, we can't give a response to that. So we have to look at FX gains and losses. So we're not able to give that kind of data today. I can
mention that with respect to inventory, the business decisions from last year, we had more intake in the winter months as opposed to the summer
months to make sure that we're ready for the individual collections. At the same time, we don't bring in 2 collections all at once. So we're trying to
synchronize things much better.

Unidentified Company Representative
What sort of competencies does eobuwie find missing?

Unidentified Company Representative
As we -- as I mentioned, we're looking at a number of strategic options, and so a partner with a lot of experience in scaling up things also in
e-commerce. And so we're thinking about people who have experience on other e-commerce markets.

Unidentified Company Representative
If we look at MODIVO, what can distinguish this project from others? What's your approach here?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
In terms of MODIVO, we want to create an international brand that will be capable of competing with the premium apparel from abroad. So at
eobuwie, we want to be top of mind for our customers who are thinking about online. So with our locality, being local is something that's a great
advantage. So customers have said that eobuwie, translated into local languages, is local store. It's very important, a big advantage, a major
competitive advantage that we have. eobuwie is top of mind because it's in the local language. And so we want to focus on that. MODIVO is more
of a global brand. And so then we want to focus on the premium apparel category to a greater extent.

Unidentified Company Representative
To what extent would you be able to achieve your strategic objectives without raising capital?

Unidentified Company Representative
So all of the objectives that we've mentioned to you in the GO.22 strategy are currently in progress. But as a result of COVID, as a result of the
potential to grow even faster, we'd like to utilize that opportunity. And so additional capital could be used for a number of objectives. So technology,
marketing, stock. It's no sense in mentioning any specific goals right now, but we could get even more market share, especially in CEE, which is
quite critical to us. But as we look at selected Western European markets, we see a lot of potential there.

Unidentified Company Representative
Now we have a question about slashing cost with an axe. What's the outlook for upcoming quarters?

Unidentified Company Representative
All scenarios are in play. We want to create a business that's capable of earning money. So we're a profitable business here in eobuwie. We have
Q4 which is the most important quarter. And it has the biggest impact and we're well-prepared for that regardless of the weather. So I can say that
all of the expenditures that the group has incurred took place in 2019, which put us in a clamp, liquidity clamp during COVID. And so we're ready
now to earn money. And so we're looking for a partner for eobuwie.

Financially, that would enable us to enter Western Europe. And we're thinking about building the value of the company. We believe that this
building is able to triple in size with a recurring beat at a specific size. And so we're all focused on that.

So the number of stores doesn't encourage us to go out and develop as retail brands. And so the sales will be developed through e-commerce,
new technology, new logistics - all those things that can increase the values. Perhaps, there are certain things that we're not able -- we're not quite
yet able to do -- capable in. So that's why we're thinking about people get ads, and this is one of the most important assets that we have. So I'm
not sure if I've given you a full response to the question, but this is the goal, the objective we had.

Unidentified Company Representative
What about the changes in consumer behavior after COVID?

Unidentified Company Representative
Could you repeat the question?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
What are the changes in consumer behavior online after COVID?

Unidentified Company Representative
We've noted a large trend, but the differences aren't major. It depends on the market, of course. What's changed is the penetration of persons
making purchases online and the interest there amongst people who are looking for purchasing opportunities. In some months, we've seen greater
retention, but this is caused by a number of initiatives and measures that we're taking.

Do we have a large number of questions yet? So let's try to accelerate things.

Unidentified Company Representative
Do you still believe in brick-and-mortar sales this time around?

Unidentified Company Representative
Ladies and gentlemen, we believe we're changing the face of our stores. And I think Karol Poltorak responded to that question. What is the store
looking like right now? It's going to be -- our stores in 2021 is going to be digitalized, wonderful communication. So it's probably going to be, on
average, a little bit smaller than the current stores we have, but these stores will perform well.

Well, even eobuwie that has its own stores, it has very large growth in sales even though traffic is down. And so they had positive EBITDA even in
the softer summer months. We're not going to close our stores because somebody is going to think up that the market is going to change in the
future, in 5 years. We're going to be participating in this market. And sometimes we have too many stores, our stores are too big. And so we'll
continue to participate in this market in a natural manner. What I've told you at the outset is that you will see changes in Q3, in Q4, and we'll see
better sales per square meter. And this is something that will happen and maybe later, I'll talk about how, but we do have some solutions in place
to do that.

The other questions are recurring, so we'll respond to them after the conference in writing. So we'd like to thank you for your attendance, and I'd
like to thank the presenters.

So today, we're starting the fourth quarter, the most important quarter. We're convinced and confident that when we present its results, that we're
going to be able to talk about our performance and the ongoing transformation of the CCC Group as well as eobuwie. Thank you very much, and
goodbye.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Greetings. Welcome to Ring Energy's introduction of Mr. Paul D. McKinney, new CEO and Chairman of the Board. (Operator Instructions) Please
note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Rochford, Co-Founder. You may begin, sir.

Lloyd Rochford;Co-Founder
Thank you, Rob, and thank all listeners for joining us today for Ring Energy's formal introduction to Mr. Paul McKinney, Ring's new CEO and Chairman
of the Board. Again, I'm Tim Rochford, Co-Founder of the company. Along with me today is Kelly Hoffman and of course, Paul McKinney.

Today, we are introducing Paul McKinney as Ring's new CEO and Chairman of the Board. We hope to provide you an overview of the process that
has led us to this transition. At that time, I'll turn the call over to Paul and give him an opportunity to share his vision for our company with you.

As this call is purely an introduction to Paul, there will be no question-and-answer period at the conclusion of our call. However, at the end of
today's call, we will provide contact information for you to be able to call and schedule a time to visit with Paul per your wish.

Again, thank you for joining us today. As we all know, 2020 has presented all energy companies, large and small, with unique challenges. I'm so
very proud of the job our management team has done since inception. There is no doubt in my mind that Ring is one of the most cost-effective
conventional operators in the Permian Basin.

However, our job doesn't stop there. As a public company, we must examine every opportunity that has the potential to enhance the value of the
company. Over the past 12 months, the Board, in conjunction with our current management team, has examined a number of projects, ideas,
suggestions that have the potential to address the disconnect, the major disconnect we feel between the true underlying value of energy -- of Ring
Energy and its current stock price.

So before going any further, I'm going to ask Kelly Hoffman to say a few words. And as all of you know, Kelly and I have had the same vision for this
company since day 1. So I'm going to turn it over to Kelly. Kelly?

Kelly W. Hoffman;CEO
Thanks, Tim, and that is absolutely correct. And this has, of course, been -- it, to me, is a very, very exciting time. In 2011, when Tim and I first met,
we spent a lot of time together. We shared our thoughts as to the opportunities and potential for a young E&P company like we built back starting
in 2011, as I said, and then just kicked off the company in January of 2013. It became very apparent to me at the time that we shared the same
philosophies and visions and as to what the company should look like. And of course, that vision has never changed.

And although the marketplace has dictated new requirements in regards to how we operate, Ring has emerged as a leading conventional operator
and a -- with a tremendous future. And I've had the opportunity to work with a team of true professionals and congratulate the efforts of my team
and the consistent results that we've had and the stick-to-itiveness, if you will, with my team and how they come in there and continue to fight
this battle and do a good job, a very good job. And in my position as CEO and Board member, I've been involved in all aspects of examining every
                                                                                                                                                                             
 opportunity to improve the company with an eye on the ultimate goal of enhancing shareholder value. That's always been in the center of our
thoughts, mine and Tim's as well.

I'm a large shareholder myself. I embrace any legitimate opportunity that can assist in accomplishing the goal that we set out for ourselves and
that's to drive the shareholder value. And in my conversations with Paul, I've had no doubt he shares our vision as to what Ring could be and should
be. His credentials and experience, they speak for themselves. This is a solid individual who knows how to move things forward. He's coming with
some fresh ideas, some new concepts, maybe. I mean, I'm excited about it as I'm excited for Paul, as I know our company is postured for future
years of growth and prosperity. And that's what I want to leave with everyone today.

With that, Tim, I'm not going to spend all my day talking. I'm going to give Paul a chance to let everyone hear from him.

Lloyd Rochford;Co-Founder
Yes. You bet. Well, listen, thank you, Kelly. And let me just say that, as I've stated on numerous occasions, our door has always been open to any
and all suggestions from all shareholders. That's always been our policy from day 1. And I think everybody on this call knows that.

Operationally, we have continued to produce positive, consistent results. From an investment perspective, we feel there's a lack of understanding
and appreciation for the value this company represents. Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have explored numerous opportunities that have the
potential to address a number of current concerns.

Through this process, I was introduced to Paul McKinney. Paul was referred to me because of his extensive industry knowledge and background
with young companies. His immediate knowledge of Ring and its operation and its core assets gave me the confidence and assurance that his
vision for Ring aligned with mine and the entire Board. Further meetings and conversations discussing his strategies to achieve that vision only
strengthened my opinion that Paul could be and should be the right choice to lead this company.

At my request, Paul met with the Board, presented his overview and assessment of Ring, together with his strategies, and as a result of that, the
Board certainly concurred with my assessment. So at this time, I'd like to formally introduce to you, Paul McKinney, our new Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of the Board. Paul?

Paul D. McKinney - Ring Energy, Inc. - CEO & Chairman of the Board of Director
Thank you very much, Tim, and you're very, very gracious, by the way. I'd like to start off thanking both Tim and the Board of Directors for this
opportunity. Let me also congratulate Kelly and the entire management and operational staff on the work they have done in a very difficult market
to set up Ring as it is.

My vision for Ring is not unlike Tim and Kelly's, just like it has been said. It's interesting, like-minded people think alike. And so our vision for the
future is very much alike. It is a future of growth and prosperity. And over the next few weeks, I will be investing my time learning more about the
company, the people and the company's assets and operations. Part of that time will also be spent formulating a program of communication with
our shareholders and analysts as to our goals and how we intend to accomplish those goals. I look forward to meeting our shareholders, and I hope
to find time within -- with many of you in the next coming days to begin that process of getting to know each other and building what I hope to
be a long-term relationship.

Now with respect to my vision, it is a pretty simple vision to say, but oftentimes, especially now challenging to accomplish. But the bottom line is
my vision is pretty simple, and it's to deliver competitive and sustainable production and reserve growth on a debt-adjusted per-share basis. And
we're going to do that by doing the things that Ring has done historically.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We're in a very good basin and a very good area to deliver profits. If you look at Ring's greatest strengths, it has a very solid production base that
provides stable cash flow and liquidity. Ring has a very enviable low cost, undeveloped inventory of drilling opportunities that provide high rates
of return even at these prices. And we believe that those assets together will deliver long-term value and growth to the shareholders.

Now the biggest challenges facing this company, first of all, the uncertainty associated with this pandemic-induced economic downturn. That's a
big one. The company's liquidity and debt, I mean, the bottom line is we've got some work to do there. We can't do anything about the economic
downturn, but we can do something about our balance sheet.

So I'm going to concentrate on strengthening Ring's effectiveness and efficiency. They have always been a very effective and efficient company.
But you can never -- you never stop pushing on those issues. Initially, we'll begin working on ways to improve our liquidity as well.

I'm sure that there will be more to add once I get past the drinking from the fire hose stage. And so -- but for now, that sums up what I'm prepared
to say now, but in the next coming weeks, there's going to be a lot more to roll out as I become more intimate and familiar with the details of the
company. We will be releasing additional information over the next few weeks, and I fully intend to hit the ground running. And so with that, Tim,
if you don't mind, I'm going to turn it back over to you.

Lloyd Rochford;Co-Founder
All right, Paul. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'd like to make a few closing remarks before ending this call. I've had the opportunity over the past
30-plus years to start, build, sell and merge 3 E&P companies. I recognize the need to provide flexibility and support to management. In that regard,
I have removed myself as Chairman of the Board, but I'm excited to remain indefinitely in an advisory capacity, working directly with Paul and
providing any assistance or advice he requires that will ultimately result in reaching our goals.

I want to personally thank and congratulate every member of the Ring team for their tireless, unselfish efforts. I'd also like to thank the Board of
Directors for their hard work, guidance and never-ending support. Thank you, all. I know I speak for the Board and management team when I say
we are very excited about the future of Ring Energy and embrace this transition as a very positive step in the ongoing growth of our company.

Now if you're interested in arranging a time to speak with Paul, please reach out to Bill Parsons. You can find his information -- his contact information
by going to the company website, which is www.ringenergy.com. He'll be happy to set up a call or set up a time that's convenient for all of you.

Now in addition to that, I should mention, because I know a lot of you are curious, yes, Delaware is moving forward and is scheduled to close a
week from tomorrow. That's the 9th day of October. We're all excited about that, and it's going to happen.

So with that, I thank you all for dialing in today. I appreciate your support. And I especially want to say to those that have been around the last
number of years, supporting us, thank you, thank you, thank you. And for now, I'm going to say so long for now.

Operator
Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for joining us today.

PRESENTATION
Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this news conference. This is historical and exciting day as this morning, we announced that Cargotec
will merge with Konecranes to create a global leader in sustainable material flow. My name is Hanna-Maria Heikkinen, and I'm in charge of Investor
Relations.

Kiira Froberg - Konecranes Plc - VP of IR
Good morning, everyone. My name is Kiira Froberg, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at Konecranes. Welcome to this event also on behalf of

Before we start, I would kindly ask you to have a look at the safe harbor statement jointly issued by the 2 companies.

Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
From Cargotec, we have also our President and CEO, Mika Vehviläinen; and also our CFO, Mikko Puolakka.

Kiira Froberg - Konecranes Plc - VP of IR
From Konecranes' side, I have here with me our President and CEO, Rob Smith; and our CFO, Teo Ottola. We'll start by a presentation by the 2 CEOs

Without any further speech, Rob, the stage is yours.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Thank you very much, Kiira. (foreign language) and welcome to today's historic conference. Cargotec and Konecranes together are creating a global
leader in sustainable material flow. Using 2019 financial figures and the 2020 June employment figures, let me give you an overview of the company
we're creating.

The future company will be doing starting at EUR 7 billion of revenue and a comparable operating profit of EUR 565 million of profitability. We will
have over 800 service locations around the world and 29,400 capable, excited, motivated employees in the new company.

Our companies operate across multiple industries, from container handling all the way to chemicals. And that demonstrates the broad and great
depths of knowledge and know-how and capabilities that our company has across the entire material flow value chain.

Each of us are bringing 3 great companies to the new future company. Cargotec is bringing MacGregor, is bringing Hiab, is bringing Kalmar.
Konecranes is bringing our Port Solutions business, our Industrial Equipment business and our Industrial Service business. Each of these great
companies have advanced technology, have top machinery, have top equipment combined with very advanced life cycle service capabilities. And
that touches and supports the entire logistical value chain across the industries that you see here. We'll be very, very well positioned across this
entire value chain.

The companies that each of us are bringing are similarly sized. And what I would like to point out, in the EUR 7 billion of sales, about 40% of that
is service revenue. And that's a starting point for us. And that service revenue is a very strong capability for the diversity of the company and for
the robustness of the company throughout all the industrial cycles.

Not only is the company well positioned in a balanced equipment and service portfolio, it's very, very well positioned across the regional portfolio.
We have EUR 3.5 billion of sales in Europe, EUR 2.3 billion in the Americas and EUR 1.2 billion in Asia. This is a very, very good footprint for an exciting
and well-balanced company. Together, we're doing an exciting thing for the world we live in. It's very good for the society today. It's very good for
the generations tomorrow.

And sustainability is also a very good business. Together, we're addressing the world's sustainability challenges. Our customers are asking for this.
The society we live and work in is asking for this. We're helping our customers, and we're helping the world decarbonize. We're providing outstanding
safety capabilities to all our customers on a worldwide basis. The productivity and efficiency that we provide is about making more with less and
having resources available and sustainable for future generations.

And part of that is maximizing the lifetime value of the equipment with that exciting equipment and service offering that the new company will
have, that maximizes the lifetime value of the capital decisions that our customers will be making.

So I'd like to turn it over to Mika to take you through the compelling industrial logic of this merger. Mika?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Thank you, Rob. First of all, I wanted to say how happy and excited I'm here today to be able to announce this great deal. In my presentation, I want
to cover the 5 key points regarding the future company.

We will be a global leader in sustainable material flow. Together, we will be unlocking significant value for all of the stakeholders. We will be the
life cycle partner for our customers, and we are solving the sustainability challenges of our customers in the material flow by combining our forces.
We will be well positioned for further growth in all of our industries and adjacencies. And lastly, of course, we are creating a real great combination
of talent globally together.

Together, we will be unlocking significant value for all of the stakeholders. With the help of our people and with the great capabilities we have in
our life cycle services and the R&D horsepower we have, we can help our customers to solve the challenges they are facing in terms of the more

                                                                                                                                                                             
 efficiency, more sustainability and more safety. This value creation is underpinned by the operational excellence that both companies are committed
to.

Can I borrow your clicker? Thank you. Thank you. For our shareholders, we will be unlocking significant value. We aim to grow faster than the
market. We expect the new future company to reach over 10% of comparable operating profit within the first 3 years of the operations. And we
expect to reach over EUR 100 million of synergies within the first 3 years after the closing. Our financial target in the long term is to have our gearing
below 50%.

Rob already mentioned that more than 40% of the revenue already today in the combined figures is coming from services. We see opportunities
to really become the life cycle partner for our customers by combining the broad services network with over 800 locations, over 8,500 service
professionals and the unique technology and capabilities we have in our service offerings to be able to offer our customers a broad set of services
and to be the life cycle partner for our customers.

We can combine really R&D horsepower. Both companies are already today known for their great technology offering and unique innovations. By
combining those capabilities, we can drive the electrification and make all of our offering and enable our customers' industries and material flow
become more sustainable.

We have unique capabilities where we can combine our know-how to drive automation and robotics in our customers' industries. And with the
unique capabilities we have in digitalization, we can build for more connected, more efficient and more intelligent world with intelligent products,
intelligent systems and intelligent services.

And we aim to grow faster than the market. First of all, in our core equipment market, by combining our capabilities, we can drive product innovation
and capabilities and grow faster than the market. Secondly, in the life cycle services, today, already over 40% of our revenues, we can combine our
capabilities, and we still have great opportunities to drive the services growth in our own installed bases but furthermore also expand more and
more towards the third-party equipment markets as well.

With the broader shoulders of the combined entity financially, we can also look at the growth in organic and inorganic ways in our adjacencies as
well.

And obviously, this is a great opportunity for our people. The future company will be future-driven company committed to ethical conduct and
fair treatment. We are building this company on a strong Nordic heritage but very strong focus also on our employee engagement, diversity and
inclusion, with uncompromising focus on the safety in all of our operations and in our customers' operations.

With that one, I'd like to hand over to Rob to talk about the structure and the governance of the new company.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Thank you, Mika. So I'd like to share how our new company will be governed.

It's proposed that our Board of Directors will be comprised of an equal number of members from both companies. Christoph Vitzthum is going to
be the Chairman of our new company. And the President and CEO of the new company will be selected and announced at a later date. This is a
decision that the Boards of Directors of both companies will be taking jointly and will be announced in due time with due process.

The name of the future company will also be determined and announced at a later stage. And I think it's very, very important to note that both
Boards of Directors have unanimously recommended this merger. In addition, we have irrevocable votes to vote in favor of this merger in both
companies, represented from the shareholders in both companies. From the Cargotec side, 44.8% of the shares and 76.3% of the votes are irrevocably
committed to taking this merger. And from the Konecranes side, 27.4% already of the votes and the shares are irrevocably committed to taking
this step together.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 This is how we're going to make the merger happen. This is such that Konecranes shall be statutorily merged into Cargotec. And to make that
happen prior to the combination, Cargotec will split its A shares and its B shares on a 3:1 basis. In addition, in advance of the combination, Konecranes
will propose to its AGM in 2021 an extra dividend of profits at EUR 2 per share. The new shares will be shared with Konecranes shareholders in a
mechanism such that 50% of the shares and votes of the new company will be held by current Konecranes shareholders and by Cargotec shareholders,
making the 50-50 split that you see here.

The timelines, I think, are very important. We expect to finish this exciting merger at the back end of next year. And the next steps are the annual
general -- or the extraordinary general meetings that we should be having, we're targeting to have those in December. And of course, we should
be going through the merger control review process with authorities in each of the jurisdictions where that's appropriate to be taken. We do all
that together and by the end of next year, we expect to have successfully completed the merger.

I finish by highlighting once again the compelling logic of taking this exciting step together. Together, we'll unlock very significant value for all our
stakeholders. As the life cycle partner supporting the entire customer journey in each of the industry segments on a very diversified basis, combining
outstanding equipment offering with life cycle services, gives our customers the support they need to be successful in their customer journey.

Together, we're solving with high horsepower R&D and outstanding engineering the sustainability challenges that our customers and society is
facing. Combined, we have very good opportunities to grow organically and also through continued M&A activities in adjacencies around our core.
And we're very excited that both companies are bringing top talent. We'll be combining to create a top talent global winning team.

Thank you very much. Hanna, I expect you're going to turn it over to Q&A now. Is that right?

Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
Yes, exactly. Thank you for the presentation, and now we will continue with the Q&A session. I kindly ask Mikko and Teo to join the stage, and then
handing over to the operator.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Speakers, we'll take our first question from our first participant.

Antti Kansanen - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Yes, this is Antti Kansanen from SEB. So congrats, all, for a great deal. My first question would be on kind of the structure of the company and the
synergies. I mean in Cargotec, we have had 3 kind of individual businesses within 1 company. And now you kind of expand that and then reflecting
that to the synergies. Should we just look at the port side? Or are you targeting to a more integrated business model where there would be more
shared benefits, more synergies between all of the different businesses? So could you provide a bit more color on where the EUR 100 million
synergies are actually derived from?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Thanks, Antti. This is initial estimate, obviously. And due to the kind of competitive authority regulators, we have not been able to do a detailed
planning regarding it. Right now, the estimate is that most of the synergies will be actually by the combined scale coming from the sourcing
primarily. But obviously, when we are moving towards the regulatory approval, further integration planning will be done. And then we are probably
in a better position to answer your question.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
I think the important thing to remember, Antti, is the exciting combinational capabilities of the new company, the R&D capabilities, the engineering
capabilities is about enabling exciting future growth in the company. And it's way too early to be talking about any synergies. Those happen and
will be planned out during the integration process that we'll be doing in 2021.

Antti Kansanen - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
All right. Fair enough. And my second question would be on the competition authorities and potential overlaps in the port side on different market
areas. Could you comment a little bit about how should we think about those processes going forward and where they are the most substantial,
let's say, overlaps in the 2 businesses or 2 companies?

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Sure, Antti. Good question as well. We've assessed that very carefully and are committed to working very closely with the competition authorities
in all the different countries where filings will be necessary. We're confident that doing that together, we'll have a successful conclusion, and we
expect to conclude at the end of next year.

Operator
We'll take our next question from our next participant.

Johan Eliason - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Analyst
This is Johan Eliason at Kepler Cheuvreux. Congratulations to a good deal. I guess they must be happy now 20 years later on. Now just on the
competitive situation. I guess, the overlap is in the mobile equipment in port -- on the port side. How do you foresee to handle that? I think for
some of those equipments, you will have quite significant combined market shares well above any sort of 40% threshold would be my understanding.

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Thank you, Johan. As Rob already said, we'll be looking obviously this into very carefully, and we will be looking forward to work together with the
competitive authorities. And we are confident that we are able to close this deal, hopefully, by the end of next year.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Johan, I think it's important to recognize that our companies operate in global industries. And on that basis, we'll be having conversations with the
appropriate competitive authorities on a global basis. And as Mika said, we're very confident that we'll do that hand-in-hand and successfully
together with those authorities and complete this in a good fashion by the end of next year.

Johan Eliason - Kepler Cheuvreux, Research Division - Analyst
And the EUR 100 million merger synergies you talked about, have you sort of assumed some remedies necessary to get the merger through? So
this is a net number or?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
It is the initial estimate based on work that obviously has been done to a large extent also by external parties. And obviously, this number will be
then looked into and to be specified during the integration planning process. And I'm sure we will come back to this one upon the closing.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Speakers, there appears to be no further questions.

Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
Maybe I can raise one more question. It may be so that the analysts are still warming up for this news.

So what kind of role does sustainability have in the future company? It seems to be a great business opportunity for all of us.

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
If you look at our customers' industries today, they are clearly under a lot of pressure regarding sustainability. Sustainability pressure comes from
the regulatory environment. It comes from their end users. It comes from the investors. And I think there are real opportunities to solve those
problems for our customers. And as important, I think, it is for all of us personally as well, I think it's also an excellent business opportunity and
offers great growth opportunities for the company when we can combine our technology know-how and services to help our customers to become
sort of more sustainable in their operations.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
I think it underpins the logic and the goodness that fit to this merger. These are 2 great companies that have a very common set of Nordic roots
and a very strong global vision. And part of that global vision is about safety and sustainability. As Mika says, sustainability is very good business,
and it's very good for the society that we work in. And it's extremely motivational for our employees, talent on a global basis, doing the right thing
for the society we live in and doing good business at the same time.

Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
It sounds like an exciting opportunity. Anything to highlight, Mikko and Teo, from your side? Maybe something about financing arrangements for
the deal.

Mikko Puolakka - Cargotec Corporation - Executive VP, CFO & Member of Executive Board
Yes. So in order to secure also the transaction we have concluded with Nordea, i.e., EUR 1.33 billion financing package. So there is sufficient funding
also to get the transaction through. Anything, Teo, from your side?

Teo Ottola - Konecranes Plc - CFO, Deputy CEO & Member of Executive Board
Nothing to add on that one, but maybe as the CEOs already were mentioning, so this is an excellent opportunity for us, as a combined new entity,
to help our customers solve the sustainability issue as well as then, of course, also to increase the life cycle service offering to our customers, which
also continues to be and in the future will be even more important part of the customer demand.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
Thank you. Now there seems to be more questions from the analysts, so handing over back to the operator.

Operator
Speakers, we'll take our next question from our next participant.

Tomas Skogman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Research of Finland
Yes. This is Tom Skogman from Carnegie. I have a couple of questions. My first question is why now?

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Tom, we were looking forward to your questions, and that's a great one. This is the right time for our companies, and this is the right time for the
industry. As Mika said, our customers are asking for this. Our society is asking for this. We're leveraging R&D horsepower. We're putting together
outstanding equipment offerings, outstanding engineering, top engineering on a global basis. Combining that with our service offering, this is
exactly what the market is looking for, and it's the right time for us to be doing this.

Tomas Skogman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Research of Finland
And then I wonder about competition authorities. I mean you will have very high market shares in certain mobile equipment products. Would you
be prepared to divest on if needed to get this deal through? Or is that a deal breaker for you if you cannot get acceptance on the mobile equipment
side?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Tom, we've obviously looked into this one. And as Rob was already saying, it's a global market with intensive global competition as well. And based
on our analysis, we look forward to work with the competitive authorities and we are very confident that we are able to get this deal through.

Tomas Skogman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Research of Finland
Okay. And then I wonder about Navis. If you manage to sell that before this deal happens, would that -- how would that impact deal terms or so,
if the value will surprise or not?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Well, first of all, no decision has been done. But as we also announced today is that we are restarting the strategic evaluation that we halted during
the COVID epidemic in Navis. So that strategic review is starting again, and it's too early to say what conclusions we will come as a company on
that one. It will not have a direct impact onto this deal.

Tomas Skogman - Carnegie Investment Bank AB, Research Division - Head of Research of Finland
Okay. And then I wonder about this -- the synergies. It's clear that there will be large synergies on the container port side. And it's clear that MacGregor
is in a quite bad shape to be -- as a stand-alone company. But then the obvious questions are, why should Hiab belong to this company? And why

                                                                                                                                                                             
 should the industrial crane business be part of this business, given the weaker kind of sales growth outlook and the fact that it's a great service
business that could be placed on the stock market as an independent company? Really, it was a cash cow and a great dividend payer in contrast
to the container business, where you have synergies and also growth.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Tom, what I like about your question is you're talking about growth synergies as well. We will be delivering over EUR 100 million of synergies
through this merger in the first 3 years. And we're also very excited about the -- bringing these 2 great companies together, that R&D horsepower,
the top engineering, being able to have a lifetime service offering for all of our equipment segments, all of our market segments, all of our customer
segments digitized and enabled with 800 service locations that gives a capability with the digitalization in our own operations as well as in our
customer operations to give customers fantastic life cycle value throughout their journey. There are some very exciting growth opportunities and
growth synergies we expect in the future company as well.

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Yes, and if I may add on that one, I think, first, the MacGregor is obviously getting in better and better shape, and we are very happy how we've
been able to make progress of turning around that business in the difficult market conditions. And as said already, all of our customers in the
material handling industry faced the similar challenges. And by combining the forces in terms of things like electrification, automation, robotization,
advanced services, we can help to serve our customers even better in the future.

Operator
Speakers, we'll take our next question from our next participant.

Aurelio Calderon Tejedor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate
It's Aurelio from Morgan Stanley. I guess first question is, if you see any noncore parts in your portfolio of the combined company? Or is that
something that you would decide at a later stage?

And the second question would be in terms of your potential in China, i.e., do you see risks that you didn't get through antitrust there in China or
in the Board side? Or do you see this more as an opportunity to tap the market, which is fairly underpenetrated by both Cargotec and Konecranes?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
In terms of portfolio, I think right now, the focus obviously is to work together with the competitive authorities and aiming to close the deal at the
end of next year. In terms of the Chinese position, China is still a great growth opportunity for us. Overall, our combined market shares in China
are not particularly high so I don't see issues as such with the competitive authorities in there. But of course, China market has its own special
characters so...

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
And I think if you take the broader Asia question, it's exciting with the combined footprint of the future company to be over EUR 1.2 billion in Asia
as a starting point with great growth opportunity there. I think the other point to address is that the composition of the future company will be
decided and run by the Board of Directors of that future company. That's 18 months from now when we are -- in the future. We expect to close this
at the end of next year, and we're very excited about the businesses that we're bringing to the future company together.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Operator
We will take our next question from our next participant.

Antti Kansanen - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
It's Antti again from SEB. Could you comment a little bit what are the key differences between your respective port businesses when it comes to
services and producing or manufacturing the equipment? And what can you learn from each other? And how can you get 1 plus 1 equal to 3 or
more?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
I think in terms of the services, technology and many other areas, there is a lot that we can learn from each other, and there is a real opportunity
to take the best practice from each other and sort of drive us an even stronger company and better performance as well. Obviously, we need to
uncover still some of those opportunities during the integration planning process as well. But if I talk about services, it's very clear that the Konecranes'
industrial crane services is very advanced in many way, at least looking from outside in, and much more advanced in terms of third-party services
compared to, for example, the Cargotec's current. And there is a real opportunity to both companies, I still think, to grow within our own installed
base, but also very much growth opportunities expanding further and further into the third-party equipment space as well.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
I think if you look at the service platform, the exciting technology platform enabled by outstanding digitalization and automation capabilities and
services, we're able to digitalize our customers' operators. We're able to digitalize and support with outstanding service platform our customers'
fleet owners. And we're able to do that and give our technicians, and actually all 800 service locations worldwide, the capability using that service
platform to give outstanding service to each of the customers in each of the segments that we operate in. And I think that's a very exciting piece
of the compelling logic of our future company.

Antti Kansanen - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
All right. And then secondly, sorry to pester on the competition authorities. But can you clarify that you are of opinion that regional market shares
don't really matter on this issue? And if they would -- which are the regions where your combined market shares are the highest at the moment?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
I said that's something we need to work together with our -- with the respective competitive authorities in different jurisdictions. We looked into
this one, and it's a very global, it's a very competitive market with the intensifying competition coming from new players as well. And we are
confident that there are solutions available for this one, which we will be working with the competitive authorities and looking forward closing
end of next year.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have much time left. (Operator Instructions) Speakers, we will take our next question from our next participant.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Colin Gibson;Bestinver;Analyst
It's Colin Gibson from Bestinver. I have just one question, please. And that is regarding the synergy number, which you've communicated so far
today. And apologies if you've talked through this one already. I was a little late on to the call. Can you confirm whether that number includes any
savings from port cranes businesses? Or whether that number is primarily elsewhere within the future company?

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
I think an important way to understand the synergies is these will be planned and detailed together as we go through the integration planning
process in 2021. There is a very significant opportunity in the new company to have growth synergies as well. And the R&D capabilities, the
innovation capabilities are very important. In addition, when we put the 2 companies together in the future company, there'll be some opportunity
for strong volume-related synergies, including, for example, direct and indirect material capabilities. So we will be planning those in detail and
very carefully together in the integration planning process that happens during the course of next year.

Colin Gibson;Bestinver;Analyst
A very professional answer, Rob, but I'm not sure I quite got the answer to my question there. Can you give us an answer on that?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
As I think Rob already and I alluded earlier was that these are the initial estimates. They've been partly done together with the third parties, obviously,
for the sensitivity reasons. And the single largest source of the early indications is obviously coming from the volume and the sourcing as well. But
this is something that we need to come back to when we can actually progress with the more detailed integration planning towards the closing
then.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from the next participant.

Erkki Vesola - Inderes Oy - Analyst
It's Erkki Vesola from Inderes. Congrats also from my behalf to this merger. How much one-off costs do you expect from this merger to create going
forward?

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Erkki, at this stage, I think we only still starting the integration planning so I don't think we are yet in a position to give you the indication on that
one.

Erkki Vesola - Inderes Oy - Analyst
But we obviously talk about the digit numbers or?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
It really depends on then on the detailed planning and looking at the different sources of synergies. And again, we come back to this one when
we have a more detailed plans available.

Erkki Vesola - Inderes Oy - Analyst
Okay. Then another one. Operationally, from now on, will all these companies be absolutely independent of each other while, of course, some
groups will be working together? But this will be reported as independent and everything will remain the same until the merger actually takes
place?

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
That's the correct understanding, exactly.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Speaker, it appears that there's no questions for now. I'll hand the call over back to you.

Hanna-Maria Heikkinen - Cargotec Corporation - VP of IR
So thank you for active discussions. And as I mentioned clearly earlier, we will continue as 2 independent companies. And Cargotec will publish
the Q3 report on October 22.

Kiira Froberg - Konecranes Plc - VP of IR
And Konecranes will report the Q3 interim report on October 28. Thank you. I think it's time to conclude now. Stay safe, everyone.

Mika Vehviläinen - Cargotec Corporation - CEO & President
Thank you.

Richard Robinson Smith - Konecranes Plc - President, CEO & Member of Group Executive Board
Thank you very much.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Select Harvests webcast. If you have any questions today, please SMS Andrew Angus on 402-823-757,
and those questions will be answered after the presentation.

I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Paul Thompson, Managing Director and CEO. Please go ahead.

Paul Thompson - Select Harvests Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director
Great. Thank you very much, Amanda, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. I'm delighted to talk to you about the acquisition of
the Piangil Almond Orchard and the capital raising associated with that orchard. Now one thing from a process perspective, I do not have control
of the slides, so those people listening in will have to flip the slides themselves which is quite easy on the right-hand side of the screen.

Just from a history perspective, this isn't the first time that we've looked at this asset. We've looked at this asset some 7 years ago, but unfortunately,
we weren't able to achieve a transaction at that point in time. It's always been a target asset for us. I can assure you, this is a competitive process
we've been through to bid for this property. And as you know, there's many pension funds, both offshore and local pension funds. We've been
very active in the almond space in the last [18 to -- 8 and 12] months in particular.

This is a quality asset that we're acquiring. It's in our preferred growing zone of South Australia and Victoria. Our preference in those 2 regions as
opposed to, say, New South Wales is that climatic conditions are more favorable for growing and there's less climatic interruptions such as rain
during harvest and rain during spray periods, which prevent us from getting onto the orchard. And as a result, generally, our growing costs are
slightly higher in New South Wales and their quality's generally a little bit lower as a result of those issues.

Firstly, I would like to point out the disclaimers that are in the presentation on pages 2, 3, 4 and 5. I'm now going to talk to you on Slide 6, talking
about the content of the presentation. I'm going to talk to you about the almond orchard acquisition. I'll give you a company update. Talk to you
about the capital raising, both the use of the capital and the structure of the capital raising.

I'm now on Slide 7. This is our strategy slide on a page, you can see that this acquisition delivers to 2 of our strategic priorities. It delivers us to the
strategic priority of optimizing our almond base and expanding strategically. It delivers scale to our organization, allowing us to benefit from this
scale in our supply chain, plus with our capital base, you will see that we're deploying this where we're going to be EPS accretive from the transaction.
And post the equity raising, we're going to be and able to maintain a strong balance sheet and allow us to continue to pursue executing our growth
strategy, which is outlined on the slide in front of you.

I'll now proceed to Slide 7, which talks about an overview of the acquisition. This acquisition has a nice blend of mature and immature orchards. It
has 1,566 hectares of orchards under trees. There's -- 1,177 of those are mature; 389 of those are immature orchards. There's 1,877 metric liters --
megaliters, sorry, of high reliability water and there's also 622 of low reliability water.

To just touch on that, we have a strategy in our business of holding 30% of our water in owned entitlements or leases, which expire with the term
of the leased orchard or -- and 30% of our water is held in leases which are between 3 to 5 years, and then 30% are bought on the spot market.
Recognizing that we're going to acquire this asset, we have actually already acquired enough water in the midterm leases and held enough water
prior to this in the long-term part of our 30% that we don't seek to acquire any more water to still live within our policy.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We are acquiring 641 hectares of unplanted land. That land we currently deem as not being suitable to plant almonds. And also the current main
lines are unable to support that -- support planting out that area. We do have to invest furthermore in the irrigation infrastructure, which I'll talk
to you about later. The -- there were also associated with this acquisition, there is some plant and equipment and housing which is part of the
acquisition.

We entered into the deed and sale agreements with United Almonds Limited, and United Almonds Limited is an MIS business, which is sort of
around the 14 years of age. We also have Bright Light Agribusiness, which is a private individual, has significant almond assets in Victoria who is
consolidating back to its base. And then we have the operators in the orchard have a shareholding in the orchard as well, where consideration is
$129 million for the purchase of the asset.

We will also be acquiring the -- we'll be acquiring a 2021 crop, so the 2021 crop is sitting on the trees today. So we will be buying those -- the
investment into those trees at costs so that we get the revenues from the 2021 crop next year. We do have -- we're not operating the orchard at
the moment, but we do have oversight on how the orchard is being operated and where money is being spent. And we're very happy with that --
the way the operating -- the orchard's being operated. As I said, it's a high-quality asset.

The acquisition is going to be funded with both debt and equity. We've entered into new facilities for debt. And we're going to do a placement of
-- we're going to do a capital raising composing of an entitlements offer of $80 million and a placement of $40 million. The acquisition is midrange
-- EPS accretive from 2022, but in -- it actually uses 2021 as well, which will be the full -- first full year of our operation, if you take into account we're
where purchasing the crop.

The acquisition is subject to conditions, including ACCC approval, which we have, but they always have the right to withdraw. I can't see any
circumstance in which they would be doing that. We have to get the approval of the MIS unitholders. And at the moment, the directors are going
to recommend that the unitholders accept our offer. We're confident that they will accept our offer. We do have break fees and no-show fees,
no-show -- no-show conditions on that so that it's highly conditional so that nobody can -- it'd be difficult for people to bid over the top of us. We
also will be seeking with the directors judicial approval from the court to the way in which the assets are divided between the unitholders. This is
an asset sale, but we don't want any recall from any of the unit members that they've been unfairly treated. We estimate that post the unitholder
vote, plus the judicial approval, that the acquisition will be completed in December 2020.

I'm now going to move to Slide 9 and talk about the actual asset. As I said, this is a high-quality asset. It would yield in the top quartile within our
current portfolio. We have a farm that is very similar to this farm, which is only 80 kilometers away. Very similar -- well, almost exactly at the same
climatic conditions, very similar soils, very similar in [zones]. We've done extensive work, probably -- we've been doing due diligence on this farm
for over 9 months, which includes a very detailed due diligence around the legal so that we're not -- have any issues separating the asset from the
units, from the MIS and the previous owners. And we've also done extensive horticultural due diligence and financial due diligence.

This farm has been well operated at a cost base, which is similar to ours. We do believe that there is opportunity, in particular, to improve the quality
of the almonds coming off that orchard, and that relates to their ability to harvest and to do that, we would be investing more in harvest equipment,
which we can talk to later on in the presentation. The quicker we can harvest, the quicker we get it off the farm and the better condition we get it
off the farm, the higher price we'll get from that almond -- from those almonds when we sell them. And the higher revenue will drop straight
through to the EBIT line.

This plant is extremely attractive. You look at the mix, we've got a nice big lump of mature cash-generative assets in there, and we also have some
future growth in there involved in immature orchards. This is a 20% increase in our area, and if you take our volume as it stands today for the 2020
crop of 23,000 metric tons, this is a 20% lift next year based on 4,600 metric tons, or 25% in the year 2026. So this is by no means an insignificant
increase in our almond portfolio.

We also have additional production, which will go through our Carina West Processing Facility. Most of it will displace existing contracts but it
means we get the full margin, the growing margin, the processing margin and the marketing margin. And importantly, it gives us more flexibility
in the way in which we run that facility. So -- and we will see drop-through in fixed costs in such areas as corporate and our horticultural team.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 If you now move on to Slide 10, this farm is located 40 kilometers away from Swan Hill on the border of Victoria and New South Wales. Swan Hill
has a population of 11,000 people. It has a good labor force and lots of services -- and great services available to us. Put this in comparison to our
other operation -- major operation at Robinvale, we're operating with a population of 3,000 people in the base. So this -- certainly, we have no
concerns about the serviceability of this property.

I'm now going to talk to you about Slide 11, which talks about what the volume impact of this has on us. And it's important you understand the
assumptions here. The long-term average yields for this farm, we've assumed, is 1.4 tonnes, which is in the red number at the top of the graph.
We've taken -- the pink represents all of our immature orchards coming into maturity. And that assumption is based on what they have performed
over the last 2 years, where they've performed well above industry average, so that is baked in there.

And then the bottom light blue area is at 1.35 tonnes to the acre, which is the industry average. We've done -- and you might say, why are you
estimating that your farms are going to yield less than the Piangil farms -- the Piangil farm you're acquiring? Part of it is the age demographic of
our farms is much older than the farm that we're acquiring. So some of them are beyond the sweet spot and are sort of in the tailing out period of
our orchards. You can see there that, that number is probably as conservative or definitely realistic when you compare our theoretical volume in
2020 versus the crop that we've actually announced in a separate presentation last night, where our theoretical volume was 21,828 metric tons,
and we delivered a crop of 23,250 metric tons. So look, I think it would be fair to assume that these are extremely realistic assumptions that we've
put into our modeling. Just -- and the other part of that is, I'm now on Slide 12, just sharing with you in both hectares and acres, the increase in
volume that is associated with this investment.

As I now go to Slide 13, you'll see what this acquisition does to our profile. With the -- pre the acquisition of Piangil in the yellow and the -- post
the acquisition of Piangil in black, you can see there that the volumes have -- the age profile has young-ed up, particularly with the new 1-year-old
plantings that are in there as well. The example of our older farm matrix, you can see there, we have a farm that's 36 years old. You can see that it's
36 years old, and it's -- that farm, for instance, is yielding 1.3 tonnes, which has an impact on our average.

I will just go through the crop processing. At the moment, we've processed 90% of the crop, as you can see there. We anticipate finishing at the
end of October -- or the middle of October. We processed very little of the Piangil orchard offtake at the moment. It's an insignificant part of that
volume. We also are estimating our crop will be 23,250 metric tons. That's up 250 metric tons from our previous updates. We've maintained our
pricing range between $7.25 and $7.75. As in our last update, we talked about difficulties with market access around the COVID-19 and the
renegotiation of pricing with customers in some of the export markets. We're now confident in that price estimate that we're giving you. The
markets have opened up post COVID, which I'll talk about in a minute.

From a COVID perspective, it did curves differently market access, which meant demand was softer. In fact, some demand certainly disappeared
from this year's volumes as people were unable to purchase or consume the product. We're deemed an essential product -- essential business by
the state government. So we are allowed -- we've been able to operate pretty well unaffected with, of course, additional hygiene practices put into
place. The biggest impact is that most of our executives have been operating from home since March and have performed exceptionally well under
pretty difficult circumstances. We have not been a recipient of JobKeeper, we're ineligible. So the result we're talking about is clear -- that has no
impact or benefit from the JobKeeper subsidy.

Our year ended on the 30th, which is obviously 2 days ago, so we haven't done our results yet, but we are in line with the consensus that's out
there, which has an EBIT of around $35 million and NPAT at around $25 million. Some people would anticipate that it should be slightly stronger
because of the increase in our crop. But we have, as previously indicated, had a weakening in the sale of our Almondco waste, hull and shell into
the stock food market as the drought has broken, and we have been -- the pricing and demand for that is decreased. As you look out -- look forward,
this sort of shortfall will be more than compensated by the drop in the water price that's associated with the drought breaking.

The almond conditions last year, the U.S. announced a -- or forecast -- the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasted 3 billion pound crop, which
is an increase of about 12% on the previous year. And the previous year was an increase, which was right around 8%. So the U.S. crop has grown
quite rapidly in the last couple of years.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Due to weather conditions, just as -- pure horticulture, the crop has been harvested earlier. So 36% of the crop is in compared to the same time
last year. Sizing is smaller, which is not uncommon in larger crop, that the actual size of the nuts are smaller. Currently, industry forecast, nobody's
talking above 3,000 tonnes, and maybe it's going to come in a little lower. Look, I think it's really a bit -- it's too early to look at that. December is
sort of when we'll get a better vision on where the U.S. crop's going to finish. They're sort of halfway through their harvest at the moment.

The August California Almond Board Position Report shows really strong demand rebound in the marketplace. Shipments were up 31% versus last
year. They sold 193 million pounds. To put that in perspective, aren't in the 1 month -- the Australian crop was 234 billion pounds. Pleasingly see
markets such as the Middle East, India and China rebounding strongly. The interesting thing in India was probably the market. The China and Indian
markets were the most -- which were affected most, particularly as they had their workforces returning to regional areas and markets and gatherings
closing, which is a big part of the way in which the product is sold in those markets.

The particularly pleasing market is India, which I think all bodes well for future demand, is we're seeing demand -- strong demand out of that
marketplace. That demand is generally driven by festivals, weddings and gift giving, none of those functions are allowed to occur at the moment
under the COVID rules in India. And people have turned to this product as a healthy option to make sure that they maintain good health to combat
the pandemic. If some of this change to healthy eating is baked into future behaviors of Indian consumers, we can see strong, strong demand out
of India moving forward.

Californian crop is 37% sold versus last year, it was 29% sold. So that is very positive, now the very positive sign for the market, recognizing that
80% of the global almond production is in India -- is in, sorry, in the U.S.

The Australian Almond Board results came out in July where the crop was down 37%. This should not be a surprise to everybody. Our sales are
down about 20%. This is just the delay of sales. It's not sales are missing. We've had approaches and agreed with our customers that there's no
point shipping them stock if they can't sell it. We don't have a credit risk with this because -- or our export customers. We have cash with documents
and we have no product stranded in ports. So things are looking good. And what we've seen as again communicated to the market is a delay in
cash flows.

If I look at the crop -- look forward to 2021. And these comments around the crop goal for both the Piangil orchard and our own orchards. We're
at the fruit sizing stage. So we've got through the challenging pollination stage of the horticultural cycle, and we're now starting to get vision on
the crop. Our tree health looks good and our outlook for the crop remains positive. It's too early to make a call on the volume. But last year, we had
multiple frost events. This year we've only had one. And we're nearly out of the frost season. That's generally [nonmilling, tough] time. I won't
comment again on the water area.

In our food business, we continue to have challenging in the Australian marketplace, particularly with disruption to certain parts of the supply
chain. I think we're all aware of what's happened to foodservice-orientated businesses. We had some good news in the -- it's good success in our
consumer business with 6 additional Lucky range products going into Woolworths. They should start showing up on shelf in the next couple of
weeks.

Our Thomastown production facility, we have a lease expiring, where we've been there for well over 10 years -- over 15 years, actually. Expires on
the year 2022. So we're having a look at both our supply chain and strategic options to how we grow that business.

I'll then draw your attention to Slide 17. On Slide 17, it shows you the long-term demand for Australian and the U.S. almonds. I don't think anybody
could be too upset with the direction in which that is going. The thing I would point out is in the period around '13 and '14, which was the California
drought, production was significantly hampered. And this is a very typical commodity market, supply and demand influence price.

So I would now like to turn to Slide 18. The first thing you can see there is that mountain, which relates to that '13, '14, '15 period of where the value
of supply came from. And the other thing that I'd like to draw your attention is that historically, almond prices have overcorrected in both of the
upward direction and downward direction. And historically, in both the times the almond prices had a positive run, generally the low is followed
by -- the following low is higher than the previous low. So the general trend price movement in prices have been moving up.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 The other thing you'll see is the collapsing of pricing between the blue line, which is the nonpareil, which is a snacking nut, and the green line,
which is the product that's used in things like almond milk and yogurts and things like that. We are seeing a movement in the marketplace to the
consumption of the product being more ingredient-based than whole snacking nut-based. So that means, basically, another way of saying the
demand for the products across the board are increasing because there are so many different alternative ways of using that.

I'd like to address now why is pricing where it is at. Why has it sort of ticked up? And what do we see -- what sort of price signals should we see for
the future? So pricing where it's at, at the moment, if you look around sort of March -- September -- between September and March last year, you
can see the pricing was pretty reasonable, pretty steady, drifted down a bit. That was really a response to the announcement of the 3 billion pound
crop. People were sitting there saying, look, this is a big increase. We're going to have to find new markets. Certainly, moving prices upwards ain't
going to do that. And perhaps if we move prices down a little bit, demand will -- that will stimulate the additional demand.

Then you can see this -- and look, most people, and including ourselves, have sold a lot of our crop at those, what I'd call, normalized pricing. Then
you can see the sharp drop in pricing after that. And that is really the announcement, the impact of COVID-19 and the large crop together. People
are trying to sell the tail end of their crop. They're also seeing COVID -- they're also seeing markets such as China and India being disrupted because
of the COVID where in those -- both those economies, ports were blocked. And also the work -- the community, the workforce and the population
was going back into the regions earning no income. So expenditure dropped significantly.

So you saw -- and then you saw farmers trying to clear the tail end of this crop saying, well, we've made our money on that crowd of the crop. Let's
just get the cash for the rest of it, and let's move on with next year. So pricing went down. It's gone down pretty close to growing costs for many
growers, particularly in the west side of the Californian part of the industry. The slight tick-up there is that's the commencement of selling the new
crop. Of course, there's a very big reluctance to sell your entire crop at a loss or at breakeven point. So we're seeing grower pressure to move prices
up. We've also seen, as I spoke about earlier, demand increasing in markets like India and China and Europe. And we've also -- people have a vision
on the crop and have a -- particularly the Americans have an impression of where it's going to be.

So typically at this time of year, pricing is generally fairly stable. We -- sorry, probably the biggest driver of moving pricing up in the future is always
demand. We have a couple of periods of times in the year where pricing is more -- pricing is more around, sort of more sensitivity. December is a
period where the U.S. know exactly how big their crop is. The U.S. growers do -- they have a vision of how much carryover stock there is into next
year. They have a vision of what their tree health is like. Generally, the U.S. tree health is more biennial than ours. They have an -- sorry, and they
know pretty well what the carryover stock is to next year as they said. So if there's any negativity -- and the last point is they also have a vision of
where -- what's going on with their water market.

If there's any negativity in those -- in any of those areas, generally, you'll see some pressure to move prices up. If there's any positivity in those areas,
you'll see prices generally move down. The other point of inflection is when they have their bloom in February, where price -- people start reviewing
pricing again.

I think the thing I'd like to reiterate is pricing is at a 10-year low. A hell a lot of almonds have been sold quite successfully and consumed by consumers
at prices far higher than the prices you'd see today. So my impression is the pricing -- and the pricing -- it's unsustainable for pricing to stay where
it is. So I can't guarantee pricing will go up in the next 1 month, 2 months, 3 months. But certainly over the next few -- next -- the horizon -- a year
plus, this pressure on pricing to move up is going to be there.

But now move on to the capital raising and the source of the capital. Firstly, we've renegotiated our debt funding with Rabo and NAB banks. They've
given us a waiver of covenant on the 31st of March on the leverage -- the debt leverage ratio. That's just reflecting the fact that we've got to invest
$25 million in working capital to acquire the current crop on the trees. And we haven't got the income from the previous crop coming in from the
Piangil asset.

The other part about it is the source of where the funds will go. You can see there, it's broken up. The CapEx of $17 million, probably about $10
million of that relates to investment in harvest equipment. The rest of it relates to investment in irrigation infrastructure to ensure that the farm
irrigation structure has the capacity to distribute the water throughout the farm, particularly to the immature orchards.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 If you look at that, we have sufficient water -- capability to bring water to the farm. It's more about distribution of water and fertilizer within the
farm.

The other thing I'd draw your attention to is that post the equity raising, we have headroom in our debt to enable us to continue to pursue our
growth strategy, and it also recognizes the inherent volatility of our business. And I was -- that was Slide 20, apologies.

Slide 21 gives you a pro forma balance sheet. And look, it's pretty straightforward. I won't go into too much of the detail of that. If you have any
questions, please come through to us.

As I said, look, we're very conscious. The Board's extremely conscious of making sure that this equity raising is equitable to existing shareholders.
So they have a priority with the pro rata accelerated non-renounceable entitlement offer. Institutionals have opportunities to put bids in from a
placement perspective. And they say that we've been -- had extremely positive response from our institutional investors.

And the other thing that is worth pointing out in the retail entitlement on Page 23 is that we'll be looking to see whether we can give retail investors
an opportunity to take up 50% of their entitlements. So that is a top-up facility, recognizing that we don't want people to be diluted significantly
or diluted at all. New shares will rank equally, and the dividend will be payable on that.

The capital raising timing is on Page 24. If I go through them from a summary, this asset -- this almond asset delivers strongly towards our strategy
about optimizing our almond base and growing strategically. And it gives us scale to our operations. Post -- and we've managed this within our
water -- existing water strategy. The capital raising is to maintain our balance strength -- balance sheet strength and give us a sufficient headroom
to recognize the volatility of the industry and support our future growth. And in summary, this farm helps us to continue to be one of the largest
almond growing processors globally. And we think it's a fantastic opportunity for the business to continue on its growth path. And we maintain
high confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the industry.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Paul Thompson - Select Harvests Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director
I've got a few questions. How does the Piangil orchard compare to the other orchards that we've looked at?

This is at the top of the tree. It's in the top quartile. I don't think there's many better assets out there that have come or will come on to the
marketplace.

The other one is, how are the current fires and drought conditions in California impacting the almond industry?

Look, there's no direct impact on the trees themselves. There's been no trees burnt or anything like that. Look, the weather conditions have made
it a little bit more challenging for them to dry their crop. It'd be fair to say they're probably going to have increased moisture in there, which will --
maybe the grading of the crop will be slightly down, and it probably will create a better environment for insects to live there, to breed in.

So I'll just wait a couple of seconds to see if there's any more questions. Hopefully, I've covered everything. And there's -- and you people are as
excited -- you, shareholders, are as excited about this as I am. Brad, have I missed anything?

Bradley Crump - Select Harvests Limited - CFO & Company Secretary
There's one other question there, Paul, I'm happy to answer, around processing.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Paul Thompson - Select Harvests Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director
Yes, yes.

Bradley Crump - Select Harvests Limited - CFO & Company Secretary
The Piangil orchard, their crop currently gets processed at the Almondco processing center in just out of Renmark. The question is, does Carina
West have the capacity to process the Piangil crop?

Yes, it does. So all the crop from next year onwards will go to our Carina processing facility, which is just over 80 Ks away, so it's close.

And what capacity is left at Carina after allowing for the Piangil crop?

So once we have this crop going into Carina, we'll be up close to 30,000 tonnes, which is sort of getting close to our capacity. With a little bit more
investment, we can bring that capacity up to 35,000 tonnes. So we do, do some external processing at the moment. Some of those contracts will
drop off this year. So we do have capacity at our current facility to handle that.

Paul Thompson - Select Harvests Limited - MD, CEO & Executive Director
Okay. Thanks, Brad. I think we'll leave it at that. So if any people have any more questions, please feel free, at the back of our presentations, we have
our contact addresses. If you can't contact us by phone, please e-mail me and we'll respond as quickly as we can. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.

PRESENTATION
Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Thank you very much, moderator. This is Jan Häglund, CEO of Enea. So I'm very happy today to announce that Enea has acquired Aptilo, a Swedish
software company. Yet another important milestone for Enea. During this call, Björn and I will take you through some of the details about the
acquisition, some of the driving forces and the rationale for the acquisition.

On Page 3, we summarize today's announcement. We have acquired Aptilo. Aptilo is very much like ourselves, a Swedish company with international
reach. Aptilo is a leading provider of quality and access control solutions, targeting, in particular, carrier Wi-Fi and Internet of Things. Aptilo has a
wide and established customer base, deployed by more than 100 operators in 75 countries.

Aptilo's go-to-market model, it is a combination of direct sales, primarily to service providers and operators as well as indirect sales through partners
and other solution providers.

With the combination then of Enea and Aptilo, there are a number of new and interesting opportunities that emerge. In particular, the combination
of 5G and Wi-Fi, and Wi-Fi 6 being the latest Wi-Fi standard creates a pretty unique offering that we have the chance of expanding. It strengthens
what is already Enea's focus area, mainly data management and it adds new customers and additional sales capabilities, also to a large extent,
complementary to what we've heard today. We'll be coming back with detail.

On the next slide, just a quick summary about Aptilo, Aptilo has been then, until today, privately held with Norvestor V fund as the majority
shareholder. It was founded back in 2001. It's headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, like Enea. And it has 2 sales offices, primarily in Dallas, U.S. and
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Björn, would you like to take us through some of the financial details of the acquisition on the next page?

Björn Westberg - Enea AB (publ) - CFO
Sure thing. So with acquisition financials. The enterprise value was SEK 150 million and that generates a [1.7] enterprise value to sale, mainly financed
by additional bank loan. Transaction cost was SEK 4 million, and that cost will mainly book in the third quarter as a nonrecurring item. And this will,
of course, impact the profit for this second half of 2020, so we expect this transaction and acquisition to be EPS accretive starting from next year.

Looking on the financial slide, next slide. There, and the estimated sales for this year is SEK 88 million and that -- comparing that to last year, annual
sales of SEK 90 million, the year before, SEK 84 million. We feel like some small impact of the coronavirus here as well.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Looking on the margin, it's initially slightly dilutive to Enea's target margin of 20%. But we target that this business will generate margin around
Enea's target margin by the end of next year. And this is acquired today and will be consolidated from today as well. And the estimated sales for
the fourth quarter, being part of Enea's books, will be around SEK 25 million.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Very good. Thank you, Björn. So back to me, Jan Häglund. So let me talk a little bit about why we did this acquisition, the underlying driving forces.

Page 8 here, talking about some of the important market trends. We all know that 5G is coming big time and is one of the major trends in
telecommunication industry. There is another parallel trend with the evolution of Wi-Fi, and in particular, the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, whereas later
this summer, there were decisions about freeing up more spectrum for Wi-Fi 6. We believe that like many other players in the industry, that is, the
combination of 5G and Wi-Fi 6, which will be critical for future wireless communication, both consumers as well as enterprises.

Another key trend is the utilization of cloud for delivery of services. Software-as-a-Service is growing rapidly and becoming more and more what
enterprises and organizations use for the consumption of services. This fact here, about 73% is just one number out of many of how important this
trend is. It's also step-by-step affecting telecommunications industry.

And then the third important trend is if we just look around us, how the Internet of Things is penetrating and helping our daily life, today, estimates
say that more than 10 billion devices are connected to the Internet. And it grows every day. So in fact, all these business trends underline why we
have acquired Aptilo.

On the next slide, summarizing Aptilo's offering. Aptilo has an offering for business-to-consumer Wi-Fi, which is very much about offloading cellular
networks in hotspot to use more spectrum and to get more capacity out of the network. Aptilo also has a well-accepted and well spread offering
around operated business-to-business Wi-Fi, where operators and service providers can offer other enterprises Wi-Fi. So it could be, for example,
shopping malls or airports or similar.

The third leg of Aptilo as well as the fourth are about Internet of Things, where Aptilo, since a few years, has an offering for Internet of Things, both
policy control as well as zero touch provisioning of devices. So all in all, this plays very well into some of the driving forces around the industry.
And the penetration with more than 200 million people, more than 100 service providers in more than 75 countries, I think, speaks for itself about
Aptilo's business being well-established in many years.

Adding on the next page, showing that Aptilo has a go-to-market model, which is a combination of the direct interaction and sales to operators
and then also indirect, both through technology partners as well as other channel partners.

Aptilo also operates in 3 primary ways delivery products. One is to delivery of software, software licenses, which also generate software license
revenues. But Aptilo also does managed services as well as cloud-based software as a service. And I think this combination of flexibility is also a
strength that we value highly. Being a software business with high gross margins and with these kind of business models also generate good and
healthy ratio of recurring revenue, being more than half of Aptilo's total revenue.

The next page, a bit more detail about the go-to-market model. Aptilo operates both through market and technology partners, large companies
like Cisco, Nokia, CommScope, and also with -- directly with operators, important customers like Telia, for example, of Scandinavia; Swisscom,
Switzerland; TELUS of Canada and many more.

So Aptilo and Enea then together. Slide 13, we've shown several times for those of you who are following us, this is how we sometimes show Enea's
portfolio and also how we're investing for the future. As you know, we have areas where we can claim #1 positions in traffic intelligence, embedded
operating systems and video traffic optimization. And we also have new areas, areas of growth, where we have at least Tier 1 position. For example,
in edge virtualization, network data layer and 5G data management.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And the later 2 then target core networks, in particular, and also even more core networks growing into 5G, with 5G core being one of the new
standards that a lot of focus is on right now in the industry.

Now Aptilo comes in as a very good complement to this, fits into the core network area. And as mentioned before then, have capability, functionality,
portfolio and customer base in the areas of Wi-Fi and Internet of Things management. So all in all, we see this acquisition as we've been looking
for as something that, in a good way, complements but also strengthen us -- strengthens us in our focus area, which is data management for core
networks.

On the next slide, speaking a bit more about the longer-term vision, I mentioned 5G Core. The 5G Core standard was, in fact, created and conceived
to be a common standard for multi-active network, starting with 4G and 5G accesses, but the plan has been all along to expand into other types
of accesses. For example, Wi-Fi or fiber access. And what this does is now the acquisition puts Enea in a pretty unique position then to be able to
offer and expand functionality, both quality in active control for cellular and Wi-Fi and also the management of both mobile phones and IoT devices.
So I'm really looking forward then to taking this evolution also into the future and into the new standards following with 5G Core.

On the next slide, we expand a bit more on the customer base. As you may know, Enea divides the business in 3 product groups: Software
Development Services; Operating System; and the largest, Network Solution. With this acquisition now, Aptilo, which will be consolidated under
product group Network Solutions. Network Solutions, which has been the growing area during the recent years will become even more important
for the company.

And Aptilo brings then an installed base and customer relations, which is similar but complementary to Enea. It's a combination, as mentioned
before, of channel partners, established relations with solution providers and also direct relations with large operators like Swisscom, like Telia, like
Batelco and several others. So I'm thrilled about that and also believe that this creates opportunities for cross-selling down the road to both of
Enea's portfolio as well as the Aptilo portfolio.

So just to summarize by just reiterating that Enea today announced that we have acquired Aptilo, very happy about that. Aptilo being a leading
provider of Policy and Access Control solutions for carrier Wi-Fi and IoT. Aptilo's enterprise value in the acquisition amounted to SEK 150 million.
And the rationale, the reason and the plan is to strengthen Enea's data management portfolio, to extend the market reach and also to materialize
new opportunities, both in 5G, Wi-Fi, Internet of Things as well as software reserves.

So with that, I'd like to thank you and hand back to the operator.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have a question from the line of Viktor Westman of Redeye.

Viktor Westman - Redeye AB, Research Division - Analyst
Can you hear me guys?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Yes. Relatively well, Viktor.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Viktor Westman - Redeye AB, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Good. So I saw this company has a downward trend in sales all the way since 2015. So you say something about what's behind that decline?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
So it's correct. But if you go into the history of Aptilo, Aptilo has changed its strategy during the years of '16 and '17 into becoming more focused.
More focused on the services that I mentioned and also more focused towards a certain market.

During the recent year, that evolution has actually stabilized and some of the numbers that we also published, you'll see that the trend recent years
has been much more stable. So in other words, there -- it could be an underlying growth in the newer areas.

Well, we published some of the numbers in the press release. I think last year, you saw a sales of SEK 90 million, the year before was SEK 84 million
and the estimated sales for this year is SEK 88 million, possibly with some corona effect on the top line.

Viktor Westman - Redeye AB, Research Division - Analyst
Yes. Understood. And -- but this -- still this, I think this acquisition differs a bit from the ones you did in say, Qosmos or Openwave that were growing
businesses, I think in some way, whereas this one has struggled a bit. Have you done any changes in your M&A strategy?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
No. I think this follows our M&A strategy. And we have said all along that we're looking for businesses which are established, where there is both
an offering as well as the customer base, which is complementary to Enea's and where we believe that we can do things for the future and I think
some of the underlying business trends I showed you in this call. So that's why we believe that the timing of this acquisition is the right one.

Viktor Westman - Redeye AB, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And last one, will this affect your Policy and Access Control business in any way? I know that you mentioned this will be run as a stand-alone
unit, but are there any plans or anything to do to -- any synergies or anything?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Yes. We will follow the same integration or the same strategy as we've done with the previous acquisitions to keep Aptilo as a separate business
unit for -- to focus on the business, to focus on the customer base. And then we will, of course, step-by-step, look into how we can utilize the
strengths of both companies, and that could be both internal on administration or cost or towards customers, for example, cross-selling our
portfolio.

As you point out, in our Policy and Access Control portfolio, which very much targets service providers, but more on the cellular side, 4G and 5G is
complementary to what Aptilo does.

So I believe that down the road, there will be possibilities, both on the portfolio side, and also very much on cost saving. But we will take that
step-by-step as we usually have done.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Maaø of DNB Markets.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Frank Maaø - DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Congrats with the acquisition. So part of my question have been answered. But if I may, could you talk a little bit about the competitive space in
-- within Policy and Access Control for the Wi-Fi market? And also the IoT connectivity management with provisioning and so on. That I understand
is kind of the 2 main areas of Aptilo in terms of -- you clearly say that Aptilo is a leading company in the space, but it is a small company. And if you
could give some color on market shares and competitors, that would be nice.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Sure. Thank you, Frank. So I think Aptilo has a position similar to Enea, that it's a leader being independent as a provider. There are then -- there is
then competition, of course, and competition comes from different angles. It can be competition from large service providers that have this as part
of their offering that could be, for example, telecommunications or even enterprise solution providers that have this kind of functionality, maybe
not exactly the same but similar type of functionality as part of a larger solution offering.

Competition can also come from Wi-Fi hotspot providers that add software functionality for the management. And that, in many cases, is not as
advanced as Aptilo has. And in many cases, service providers have chosen Aptilo's software as a complement to the more basic functionality that
they have that go together with the Wi-Fi hotspot. So as an independent company, focusing on the Policy and Access Control for these areas, Aptilo
has a strong position on the market.

Frank Maaø - DNB Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Interesting. So thanks for that. That's clear. When it comes to -- I mean, it is an almost 20-year-old company. Can you -- about the ups and downs
during that period? I mean you gave some color on 2018 and '19, but a little bit -- looking backward a little bit. Has there been periods of decline?
Or has it been up and down? Or has it actually been building a growth company step-by-step, which has matured a little bit now, perhaps?

And also secondly to that, why do you think the current owner is selling the company to you right now? It's always the same old winner's curse
kind of a question perhaps there, but if you could give some color on that, would be great.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Okay. Yes, I can't really speak for the current owner. I think that's better that they would speak for themselves. But talking about Aptilo's history,
it's correct that Aptilo has been around for a while. It has grown on own merit, but it's also been through a couple of transformations.

I think we all know that the role of Wi-Fi has been changing in the history. I mean, in some -- we all use Wi-Fi, I think, in our everyday life. And I think
during some periods, Wi-Fi has taken a role primarily offload. I think during other times, Wi-Fi has emerged as a preferred way to offer, for example,
public connectivity, and that is still underlying and still growing in some parts or in many parts of the world.

And then I think Wi-Fi has emerged also with the price points and especially the access to unlicensed spectrum, has an interesting opportunity
also for future connectivity. And here, the whole sort of wireless trend also around enterprise is something to watch. And that's what I touched on
before that Wi-Fi -- it's not about Wi-Fi or cellular access, but more the combination.

So I think we believe that the role of Wi-Fi will continue to be important. It will have its niche. But I think the work that Aptilo has done during recent
years to streamline both portfolio as well as go-to-market and market presence has been very good and healthy, and we can leverage that more
sort of a slim and streamlined company now going forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Simon Granath of ABG.

Simon Granath - ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst
Congrats on the acquisition. I think that many questions that I had in mind had already been answered. But initially, perhaps you could clarify for
us a little bit on when we could see the cross-selling opportunities that you are seeing? I know that you touched upon it, but could you provide us
some more color on it? And that would be great.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Thank you, Simon. But as I said, we will do what we usually do. So we focus on a successful integration, making sure then that Aptilo comes in under
a new home, as a separate business unit of Enea. We want to make sure that we have stability for the employees, for the customers today. And
then we take it from there. And I think, as hopefully was obvious in the presentation here, we are quite similar companies, not only are we both
based in Stockholm, which will facilitate integration and also people-to-people interaction, but also we have similar kind of go-to-market models
and similar kind of target customers, but interestingly enough, quite complementary also, what are the top customers from Enea versus Aptilo.

So that's something we will work on. Then as we all know, the sales cycle in telecommunications are quite long. And normally, it can be 12 to 18
months in terms of winning new business. So it will take some time, but we will, of course, expand over time to start to investigate that right away.

Simon Granath - ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division - Research Analyst
Is it also possible to give us some ballpark figures regarding the sales competition, both in terms of whether it's mainly targeting operators or
carriers? And also in terms of the sale split between on-premise licenses and support and maintenance. I know you said that the company has more
than 50% recurring revenue, but some more ballpark figures on the other parts would be very great.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Yes. As of today, we don't disclose any more details on the split between different business models or different parts of the business of Aptilo.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Koria (sic) [Ramil Koria] of SEB.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
I take it that was for me, Ramil, from SEB. Congrats on the acquisition. I have a few pretty stupid questions, so sorry in advance.

But just first off, sort of the partnerships or the indirect sales models to Ericsson and Nokia. Could you elaborate on what specifically those types
of channels mean? Are you the sole vendor for these solutions through Ericsson and Nokia?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
So thank you, Ramil. I have to pass on the details of that. I'm not sure exactly what has been, of this time, that I suspect that the details of those
relations are not public. So it's something we'll have to come back to if we have reasons to make it public. I think what we can say today is that
                                                                                                                                                                             
 there is a relation where historically Aptilo has been complementing some of the large solution providers in their solutions based on the strength
and specialty that Aptilo has.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Understood. But just a word or 2 perhaps on sort of the bundling potential from a partner point of view, what could they add theoretically speaking?
And I know this is a very broad question to Aptilo's solutions and then upsell them just to get a feeling for what exactly is provided here.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Well what Aptilo does is that it provides, for example, as I mentioned before, advanced policy and control solutions for carrier Wi-Fi. That could be,
for example, business to business. As I mentioned, a carrier wanting to offer, say, a chain of shopping malls or similar, the possibility then to have
Wi-Fi or a connectivity offering, perhaps in a different business model, it can be, for example, advertising, finance.

So that's kind of advanced policy control while you target different services to different customer groups is something that Aptilo has been
specializing in. And that offering is quite unique, and Aptilo is well-respected for that. And in many cases then, that can come in and complement
an offering from -- for someone who offers more of the connectivity solution. And that could be everything from the actual hotspots to the more
basic connectivity functionality.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
That's clear. And then perhaps squaring this to ask you on solutions, how would these solutions square up to them? Is there any bundling potential
there? Or are they perhaps competing potential on the market?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
So there is very little competition or overlap with what Enea does. We -- as we've been targeting before, we have an offering already in Policy and
Access Control, which is an important part of the data management piece of today than tomorrow's core networks. Our focus so far has been very
much on wireless access. But as I mentioned before, the trend goes towards building networks that can handle different kind of accesses, different
kind of business models with the expertise and solutions targeting Wi-Fi and IoT. We believe that it's a great complement for us, both today and
also going forward.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
That's clear. And then looking at the markets, I mean, I guess we're still a few years out from peak IoT, for lack of better words, should we expect
growth to potentially gain speed ahead? Or how should we sort of regard the underlying market share?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Yes. But we have not guided into the future development of Aptilo here. I mean, we have given the financial impact where we show them that
thanks to a high ratio of recurring revenue and stable business models and stable customer relations Aptilo has, despite a very tough market that
we also are experiencing as Enea this year, has been able to hold up revenues in a good way. That's why we forecast revenues almost on the level
of last year for Aptilo.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Then as you say, there are growth vectors on the market, the growing amount of IoT devices. So it's about taking a part of that market, starting
from small numbers. And it's also about the evolution of the role that 5G will take together with Wi-Fi and in particular, Wi-Fi 6, also a nation's
market or it's as late as this summer that the Wi-Fi spectrum was broadened and expanded by some of the regulators across the world.

So that's also something that will be exciting to follow what that means in terms of investments and opportunities. So we'll be working hard to
capture some of those opportunities. But I can't give you more sort of financial guidance or outlook at this time.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
That's fully understandable. Just 2 final questions from my side, and we've touched upon the first one, at least. But on the upselling potential, I
mean, we know for a fact that, at least the biggest carriers have quite dispersed procurement functions. And given the pure overlap with sort of
Enea's existing portfolio with Aptilo's portfolio isn't enormous and then targeting to some extent, different parts of the network. How do you sort
of reckon that the initial phases of upselling would happen more specifically? So another broad question, but any flavor is helpful.

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
Sure. No, but I think it's well-known that it's important to understand customers, to have the trust of customers and to have established relations.
Then of course, you need to fight for every piece of new business. That's always the case. It's a very competitive industry.

So nothing comes for free and nothing comes directly. There are long sales cycles in telecommunications. But having said that, I'm very excited
about the fact that we have a complementary customer base, where we have the opportunity of using the trust and the relations to also position
other parts of our portfolio going forward.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
It's crystal clear. And then a final one, perhaps doing what financial markets always do. How would you reason about more M&A opportunities from
here? Is that a question of focusing on integrating Aptilo and trying to find upselling opportunities? Or would you be opportunistic for new M&A
opportunities?

Jan Häglund - Enea AB (publ) - President & CEO
So I think today's announcement and acquisition shows that we're delivering on our strategy. We have said since a while that M&A continues to
be part of our strategy, especially as a complement to the investments we've done during recent years and also as a complement to the organic
investment that we continue, for example, towards 5G virtualization on fiber security.

That said, we will continue to be picky. We will look very carefully to companies that both can deliver value in terms of being established as the
businesses, at a reasonable price and also companies that complement us in a good way that have touch points where they complement either
portfolio or customer base. I think Aptilo fits the bill on all those criteria. So I'm very happy about that.

And going forward, I believe that we have a financial position with strong profitability and cash flows that we've been able to generate in the history
to take further steps. But as I said, we -- it's always about focusing on the integration you have, and then we will continue to pursue our strategy,
where the organic growth and organic investment is our base, and then we will continue to look for complementary acquisitions.

Ramil Koria - SEB, Research Division - Analyst
Congrats once again.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Thank you, Jonae. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So today, we achieved a very important milestone when we announced the
encouraging results of the PXL770 Phase IIa trial for the treatment of NASH. Before I hand the call over to David, I would like to take a few minutes
to provide a brief overview of the company for those of you who are not familiar with Poxel.

Beginning with Slide 3. Poxel is focused on developing innovative drugs for the treatment of metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes and
NASH. We have a strong foundation in this therapeutic area dating back to the company's inception when it was spun out of Merck Serono. We
have a mid- to late-stage pipeline as well as earlier-stage programs from our direct AMP kinase and deuterated TZD platforms.

Please go to Slide 4. Our pipeline includes our most advanced drug candidate, Imeglimin, which is globally partnered for the treatment of type 2
diabetes. Through our partnerships with Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, a new drug application is currently under review in Japan. Sumitomo is
currently targeting a product launch in their fiscal year 2021, which is April to March. They also have developments and commercialization rights
for China and 11 other Asian countries. Metavant, our partner for all other countries not covered in the Sumitomo agreement, has ongoing dialogue
with the FDA to finalize Imeglimin Phase III plan for the U.S. and Europe.

The Phase IIa results for PXL770 for the treatment of NASH that we announced today support the potential to advance the development of this
molecule into a Phase IIb biopsy-driven trial.

For our second program in NASH, PXL065, we initiated DESTINY 1 early September. It's a streamlined, dose-ranging Phase II trial for the treatment
of NASH. As a reminder, PXL065 is a new chemical entity derived from pioglitazone, specifically deuterium-stabilized single stereoisomer, which
has been shown to retain NASH efficacy without triggering PPAR gamma-related side effects in preclinical studies. This mechanism involves
modulating non-genomic pathways such as the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.

We also have an agreement with ENYO Pharma for FXR agonist, which is currently in a Phase IIa program.

For our earlier-stage preclinical programs, we are advancing work related to our direct AMP kinase and deuterated TZD platforms. Today's results
give us further conviction related to AMPK and its utility for several metabolic disease.

I will now hand the call over to David.

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Thank you, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Before diving into the results, I'd like to first briefly review the AMPK mechanism as well as earlier
results for PXL770 that led to the positive outcome reported this morning.

Let's turn to Slide 5. AMPK is a master regulator of several important metabolic pathways, including pathways also linked to the control of
inflammation. Importantly, we know the conditions associated with overnutrition are also associated with reduced AMPK activity in key tissues
like liver in the case of NASH. Thus, direct activation of AMPK is an approach to restoring normal AMPK tone and a compelling and novel target for
NASH and a range of other chronic and rare metabolic diseases.

Turning to Slide 6. The downstream effects of AMPK activation lead to PXL770's potential ability to address each of the key hallmarks of NASH,
which we define as steatosis, inflammation, ballooning and lastly fibrosis. Unlike some other mechanisms which act primarily to reduce steatosis,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 several lines of evidence, including our internal data, show that AMPK activation can independently affect inflammation, fibrogenesis and
hepatocellular death. In addition, root causes, including insulin resistance, can be ameliorated. Here, you can see how our data in rodent models
and human cells are beginning to align with and translate into emerging clinical results in the target population. Significant effects from the Phase
IIa study that we report today are highlighted in red in the right hand column. I'll review these findings in subsequent slides. Overall, the profile is
very encouraging for the future, specifically anticipating the potential for further efficacy when histology data would be available.

Turning to Slide 7. More specific results from multiple preclinical studies are depicted here. These studies have shown consistent and promising
results with respect to each of the core elements of NASH. I'd also like to note that PXL770 may also be differentiated from other compounds in
development for NASH since AMPK activation also has the potential to treat major comorbidities by specifically targeting cardio-metabolic risk
factors such as hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

Moving now to Slide 8. Our preclinical data and evidence from the literature also highlights the potential of PXL770 to show even greater additive
or synergistic benefits to treat the root causes of NASH when combined with other agents in development. We've studied several combinations
in a classic rodent NASH model. These include PXL770 with semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist; obeticholic acid, an FXR agonist; and MGL-3196,
a thyroid hormone receptor agonist. As shown in the example on this slide, co-administration of PXL770 with semaglutide resulted in further
improvements in several key disease-related parameters, including hepatic steatosis and plasma ALT. Additive benefits were also observed with
other agents studied to date. These studies highlight the potential for complementarity of use with a broad range of other classes in NASH.

On Slide 9, we have summarized here the cumulative prior clinical experience with PXL770. In over 130 healthy subjects, we observed suitable PK
properties and good safety and tolerability. In the more recent 4-week PK/PD placebo-controlled study in 16 likely NASH patients, we met our
endpoint and objectives. PXL770 demonstrated a PK profile that was similar to the one observed in healthy volunteers and was also observed to
be safe and well tolerated. Notably, PXL770 also induced a statistically significant suppression of de novo lipogenesis, which is linked to AMPK and
known to be an important contributor to the accumulation of liver fat or steatosis that underlies the pathophysiology of NASH.

Despite this also being a nondiabetic population, we also noted a greater effect on de novo lipogenesis in patients with more severe metabolic
dysfunction. A statistically significant improvement in glucose tolerance during a glucose challenge test was also observed in this study. Moreover,
we observed additional significant improvements in several indices of insulin sensitivity. This trial then confirmed the target and pathway engagement
with PXL770 and its potential utility in other metabolic diseases. These results also represent the first human experience with a specific AMPK
activator, and they support our hypothesis that this novel mechanism could be safely harnessed and have a beneficial role in controlling key
pathways that lead to liver injury in NASH or utility in other indications.

Turning now to Slide 10. STAMP-NAFLD, the trial's name, is a Phase IIa 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial which enrolled
120 presumed NASH patients with or without type 2 diabetes. The trial was conducted at several sites in the U.S. The primary enrollment criteria
was evidence of hepatic steatosis or NAFLD based on the percent liver fat mass greater than 10% as measured by MRI-PDFF. The trial evaluated 3
different dosing regimens of PXL770 versus placebo. This included 4 groups of roughly equal size. Patients who received PXL770 at 250 milligrams
once daily, 250 milligrams twice daily, 500 milligrams once daily or patients who received placebo. The primary endpoint of the trial was the relative
change in liver fat content based on MRI-PDFF, an imaging-based biomarker that allows for quantitation of steatosis in the entire liver. Other
secondary measures on multiple disease-related parameters helped to confirm efficacy in NASH as well as to shed light on other related indications.

Slide 11 depicts baseline patient characteristics. Patients were overweight or obese and 41% to 47% of each group had type 2 diabetes. Patients
with diabetes were well controlled and treated with monotherapy or diet as reflected in normal mean fasting glucose levels and mean hemoglobin
A1c, HbA1c values for each group, which averaged around 6% or below the 6.5% threshold for diabetes. Liver fat content was 16% to 22% at
baseline and generally balanced across the groups. Importantly, mean ALT levels at baseline were also nearly normal, either at or below the upper
limit of normal, which is 41 international units per liter.

Moving now to the Phase IIa results on Slide 12. MRI-PDFF was used to measure effects on liver fat mass. PXL770 was observed to produce dose
responsive effects with a statistically significant relative mean decrease of 18%, a p-value of 0036 from baseline at 12 weeks in the 500-milligram
QD group and 14% in the 250-milligram BID group. Both placebo and 250 milligrams QD of PXL770 produced negligible effects. The proportion
                                                                                                                                                                             
 of patients who achieved greater than 30% relative fat mass reductions in the 500-milligram group was also substantially greater than in the placebo
group. In addition, some patients were highly responsive and were observed to achieve up to 85% relative reductions in liver fat mass.

As shown on Slide 13, a more pronounced effective PXL770 on liver fat mass was observed in the 41% to 47% of patients who also had a diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes. In these patients, a dose-responsive decrease in relative liver fat content was observed with an effect size averaging 27% in the
500-milligram QD group. This key subgroup represents approximately 47% of all patients with NASH and is known to be at higher risk of progression
to more advanced stages of fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. It's also known that endogenous AMPK tone is lower in tissues from animals and
humans with type 2 diabetes.

Slide 14 displays the effects on ALT levels. Although baseline ALT levels in each group were within the high normal range, we did observe a significant
6.3 IU per liter change in the mean absolute ALT levels at the top dose of 500 milligrams QD. In addition, the pattern of changes in ALT suggest
that we have not reached a plateau at 12 weeks. We are performing further analysis of this data to assess these findings and to examine effects on
other related parameters.

Slide 15 shows effects on hemoglobin A1c in each group, including both patients with and without diabetes. Here, we observed a dose responsive
and significant decrease. Not shown here was a parallel strong trend towards reduced mean fasting glucose that was also observed. As a reminder,
baseline hemoglobin A1c values for each group were within the normal nondiabetic range, consistent with the presence of mild, well-controlled
diabetes in those patients with a diagnosis.

The placebo-adjusted effect of negative 0.3% at 500 milligrams QD is therefore clinically meaningful. By comparison, the landmark diabetes
prevention program also studied nondiabetic glucose-intolerant patients. After 6 months of treatment with metformin, a mean placebo-adjusted
decrease in HbA1c of approximately 0.15% was observed in 850 patients.

Slide 16 summarizes the safety findings from the STAMP-NAFLD trial. Treatment with PXL770 was observed to be very well tolerated in all 3 treatment
groups. The number of patients in each group who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events was very similar to the number in the placebo
group. The most common AEs included mild to moderate GI symptoms, infections and headaches. There were 3 patients with serious adverse
events. Two had AEs classified as unrelated to study drug. In one patient, increases in ALT were classified as a serious AE. In this specific patient,
the increase began before randomization and was persistent with substantial elevations in ALT that were also observed several weeks after
discontinuation of therapy. This case is, therefore, unlikely to be related to treatment with PXL770. Overall, the safety profile is consistent with that
observed in greater than 140 subjects studied in the Phase I program, both health subjects and NAFLD patients.

Let's turn now to Slide 17. In summary, results from the STAMP-NAFLD Phase IIa trial lead us to conclude that PXL770 has a good safety and
tolerability profile, as I described on the preceding slide. This oral first-in-class agent was observed to produce significant efficacy with respect to
reduction of liver fat mass and to improve other key measures, which included reductions in ALT and hemoglobin A1c. The greater response
observed in patients with type 2 diabetes is noteworthy since this is a high-risk subpopulation accounting for nearly half of all patients with NASH.
Along with preclinical data showing independent effects on inflammation and fibrogenesis, including in human cells, the results of this study
support the potential to advance PXL770 for the treatment of NASH. As a key next step, we are considering a Phase IIb biopsy-based NASH trial,
which could confirm safety and further evaluate important histologic endpoints, including inflammation and fibrosis, which were not assessed in
this Phase IIa trial, and to confirm its potential in the high-risk subpopulation with diabetes.

Based on the clinical results obtained to date, its distinct mechanism and preclinical combination results, we believe that either monotherapy or
co-administration of PXL770 with other agents could provide broad treatment for patients with NASH. The results also support potential for PXL770
and the AMPK platform in other chronic and rare metabolic diseases.

Finally, Slide 18, I'd like to briefly mention our efforts to examine other indications and potentially leverage other molecules from the platform. The
results announced today for PXL770 pave the way for potential pipeline expansion. We envision that PXL770 or other AMPK activators could be
harnessed to treat a range of disorders, including rare metabolic diseases such as adrenoleukodystrophy or mitochondrial disorders, rare and
common forms of chronic kidney disease as well as additional endocrine disorders. We have strong preclinical efficacy data for several of these
conditions, including diabetic nephropathy, adrenoleukodystrophy and polycystic kidney disease.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Thanks for your attention and interest in our results. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jason Butler from JMP Securities.

Jason Nicholas Butler - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Healthcare Research & Equity Research Analyst
First off, based on the data you have today and the prior Phase I data and preclinical data, is there any rationale to consider higher doses or different
administration frequency? And then you talked about the fact that some patients had really good responders, up to 85%. Beyond the type 2 diabetes
population, were there any other attributes that describe this patient group? And I guess, can you give us a sense of how many patients were in
that higher responder group?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. Maybe I can start, David, and then please add anything there. So with regards to the first question, I think you're right. We factor the analysis
that we do, so we will have to look at various options there. One of the key goal we had from this trial was really to assess whether we want to go
on a twice daily or on a once-daily regimen. And as you've seen from the data and as you've heard from David, the once-daily regimen seems to
bring really a more significant efficacy with a good safety there, which is good. We'll then now have really to look at the pharmacokinetic profile.
We'll then have to correlate that with the pharmacodynamic profile there. And so I mean, we will need to wait for the remaining data to consider
this. But all options are really currently on the table there. David, then, do you want to take the second question on this highly responsive patients
there?

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Yes, I can start and maybe Pascale or Julie would want to add. Yes. It's an interesting question. Obviously, we just received this data recently. We're
analyzing it as we speak, and we'll potentially have some additional parameters to look at that may or may not be able to help us identify the more
responsive patients. But we do think that what we have seen so far, and it's consistent with what I mentioned from the PK/PD trial, is that patients
with more severe metabolic dysfunction, in this case, patients with type 2 diabetes, seem to be clearly more responsive in general. And that to us
is kind of interesting and encouraging results. Anything to add, Pascale, Julie?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
No, I think what you say, David, is what we have as data today. But well, we will wait to have the full data to look deeper into difference between
type 2 diabetes and nondiabetic patients.

Jason Nicholas Butler - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Healthcare Research & Equity Research Analyst
Okay. That's really helpful. And then just 1 more for me. As you think about the Phase IIb trial design, obviously, the type 2 diabetes population is
a relevant consideration. But other things that you're thinking about? And maybe give us the context given your Phase IIb trial design for the 065
program?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Pascale, do you want to answer this one?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
I'm sorry, I didn't get the question.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
It's on the Phase IIb. So maybe I can rephrase and start to answer. So Jason wanted to have more detail about what we're planning for the -- what
we're planning really for the Phase IIb. Is it going to be in diabetic patients there? Or any other detail that basically we believe could be important
for the Phase IIb.

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
I think this study, this proof-of-concept study, was really important for us to get a sense of the size of the effect of PXL770 and to confirm the
previous data that we have observed in the PK/PD related to the better effect even in more severe insulin-resistant patients, which seems to be
the case here. I think it also gave us a lot of information of the dose regimen and the dose with BID or once-daily and dose range. So I think we
really have to first get the complete view of all the data before moving forward with the Phase IIb design. But well, honestly, the design might be
very classical with biopsy and -- but I think we need to get all the data before...

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Maybe you...

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Getting too much on that. Yes.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Maybe one point of clarification, Jason. I think in contrast, as you know, for PXL065, we can benefit from the 505(b)(2) pathway coming from
pioglitazone. So that's why we designed this streamline Phase II program, still with the aim to assess the efficacy, however, with the primary endpoint
to be the liver fat mass reduction and to be correlated as a secondary endpoint with the histology data. Here, for 770, as you have understood, we
believe that there is much more than the liver fat mass that we've seen here during this Phase IIa, given that the drug hit really the target. And it's
been demonstrated that by activating AMP kinase, we could also benefit from additional efficacy independently from the metabolic benefit. We
can benefit from inflammation benefit and fibrogenesis benefit. And so that's why I believe that histology data will be really pivotal in this Phase
IIb. And as you have understood as well, maybe treating longer, could be also very important to have the long-term efficacy data. So as Pascale
said, it would be more like a classical Phase IIb in biopsy-proven NASH patients treated for 9 months, 12 months or more. And then, of course,
around this, there could be a multiple option. But really, this is going to be the core component of this trial.

Operator
And next question comes from Lucy Codrington from Jefferies.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Lucy-Emma Mary Sarah Codrington-Bartlett - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
I've got a couple. Firstly, am I right in understanding that these were per protocol responses? And if so, did the ITT population differ at all? In terms
of the safety, were there any discontinuations due to the treatment-emergent adverse events? And then lastly, I do appreciate you still need to
analyze the full data set and think about the Phase IIb, but is the plan to include a broad NASH population initially in the Phase IIb with some
subgroup analysis or could you actually consider focusing on subpopulations sooner rather than later? And then actually, I have one more. I just
noticed that there was quite a much higher proportion of female patients in the 2 higher dose groups. I wonder if there are any implications as a
result of that.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Thank you very much, Lucy. Pascale, maybe you want to take these questions, starting with the per protocol versus the ITT population there?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Yes. This is the per protocol population, but we also have data in the ITT population, which are very close to the data observed in per protocol. We
believe that this per protocol was more accurately representing the data for this study.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
For the second question, Pascale, on the safety, any discontinuation due to adverse event?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Yes. There was some discontinuation, but 1 or 2 discontinuation per group and without any specific, I would say, reason in terms of safety.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
For the third question, I think, Lucy, yes, I think we definitely have different option on the table because this broader benefit that we've seen on
type 2 diabetes is not just coming from this trial but also from the PK/PD trial. And we know, and David described this well, we can expect really a
broad benefit targeting NAFL in diabetic patient. So do we want to really solely focus on this population for the Phase IIb or the rest of development
or include a significant number of this? I mean, that remains to be fully analyzed there. But certainly, it would be a key area of focus. And maybe I
don't know whether David or Pascale, you want to elaborate on this?

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Yes. I think it's a very interesting and attractive concept, and it's something that we're actively discussing with our expert advisers and also continuing
to look more closely at the data. So we don't have any definitive answer, but that's definitely on the table.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
And so for the last question...
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
And last question would be for females, the imbalance of males and females, maybe Pascale, you could?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Pascale, on this last question on the imbalance between -- on the 2 top dose for female and male there?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Yes. We don't believe that this made an impact on the result because, honestly, in terms of PK, there is no evidence of any difference between male
and female. So there is no currently reason to believe that this may influence the result.

Operator
Next question comes from Andy Hsieh from William Blair.

Tsan-Yu Hsieh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Congratulations on the encouraging results and finishing the trial. So my question has to do with the trend line. So I think, Thomas, you mentioned
a little bit about the ALT trend, which is that it has not plateaued after 12 weeks. I'm just wondering if the same observations could be said about
the liver fat reduction and also potentially glucose sensitivity, HbA1c, just curious if you can comment on that.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. Thank you, Andy, for this question. Pascale, do you want to answer this one?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
So yes, well, we have only 1 MRI in this study as it was a very short duration study of 12 weeks. So we don't know whether all the effect has been
captured after 12 weeks or if we can expect more deeper decrease with time. What we have observed is that the decrease in ALT is not something
immediate, but it's a little bit delayed. So this may also get deeper with a longer duration of treatment. As far as the glucose control and A1c, well,
the patients were at very low A1c baseline to start with. So well, I think that the decrease that was observed in this study for these kind of patients
and this glucose control, I think it's already a very meaningful decrease.

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Maybe I could just add to Pascale, a couple of comments on these questions, Andy. So as you know, HbA1c is an integrated measure of glucose. It
takes time, no matter what the mechanism, to reach a steady state. And with most glucose lowering agents, you're nearly there but not all the way
there by 12 weeks, and it usually takes 24 weeks to reach a steady state. So we would expect potentially some further effect on glucose. But as
Pascale said and as I said earlier, what's remarkable here is that the baseline HbA1c was really not in the diabetic range, and yet we still see significant
reductions. So that's very encouraging to us.

And then as far as the ALT is concerned, again, as Pascale said it and I mentioned it, we don't think we've hit a plateau there yet either. And many
of the other NASH studies similarly show that, in some cases, depending on the mechanism, you don't reach a steady state until you get out to 24
weeks or beyond in ALT.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Tsan-Yu Hsieh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. Got it. Yes. So I also have a PK question, if you don't mind. So just curious if there's kind of an explanation in terms of the BID dosing and the
QD dosing. So 250 BID, 500 QD, there seems to be a difference in terms of potency for those 2 dosing schemes. Is there some sort of scientific
explanation or PK explanation for that?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
So maybe I can start and please, David and Pascale, feel free to add on this. So clearly, the aim at the beginning when we designed the trial was to
assess whether -- so when we analyze the data in animal and with some allometric scaling there, we model that really once-daily regimen would
be the dose regimen to go for in human. However, again, coming back to the mechanism of action because it's really related to our mechanism of
action, we see that in line, whether having twice-daily regimen could add because there are various ways to activate AMP kinase. And we wanted
to test this with a similar dose, which is this 500 milligram, either the once-daily or BID. And here, well, I mean, we've seen that and that you've seen
in data that the once-daily regimen seems to be more appropriate than the BID regimen. We don't have, as you know, as I mentioned earlier, we'll
have to do the full PK analysis to correlate that really with the PD to see what options really do we have going forward, but that's really the basis
for this analysis. And I don't know, David or Pascale, whether you want to add anything there?

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
No. I would just say that it's a typical profile for an oral agent. We have a long terminal half-life that's described on Slide 9. But despite that, we have
more drug exposure during the first 12 hours. So there is a difference between giving it once a day or twice a day, maybe not in terms of AUC but
in terms of Cmax. So we're trying to sort through that, really understand it. But I think it's very important that we have defined what appears to be
a preferred regimen so far.

Tsan-Yu Hsieh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. And then last question has to do with the kind of the type 2 diabetes subpopulation. Just curious on your views in terms of kind of the
placebo response in that healthy subpopulation. You do see placebo patients doing also a little bit better. So if you kind of correct for that, the
absolute placebo-adjusted difference is actually pretty similar. So just kind of want to get a sense of your interpretation on that. And also in
discussions with NASH experts, is there a subpopulation where you can kind of define kind of the diabetes/NASH patients as like a clinically definable
indication from the regulator's perspective?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. David, do you want to answer this one?

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Yes. So regarding your first question, we were actually pleasantly surprised that the placebo response in the trial as a whole was minimal. And if
you look at the data that's on Slide 13, there's a slightly greater placebo response in the patients with diabetes. But also, I think we take into account
the fact that we have an essentially ineffective dose, the 250-milligram daily dose, which, in this sense, could be considered more like a placebo.
So we do believe that at least the data strongly suggests that there is a substantially greater response in patients with diabetes overall, and that's
consistent with what we've seen in the PK/PD trial.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Your second question was around whether regulators would accept a subpopulation. I think they would. It has commercial implications and safety
implications, but there are certainly precedents for this in many different disease states that I can think of. And it's a black and white definition.
You either have diabetes or you don't as a diagnosis.

Next question comes from Benoit Louage from Degroof Petercam.

Benoit Louage - Banque Degroof Petercam S.A., Research Division - Research Analyst
Congrats on the readout. Actually, quite a substantial amount were already answered by -- during this call. I still have a few left from my side. So
most of them relate to the Phase IIb design. Could already be confirmed that at this stage the Phase IIb would still, at this stage, be focusing on the
monotherapy setting rather than already exploring certain combination with other mechanism of action? That's my first question. And then the
second and final question is also related to the Phase IIb. So could we confirm at this stage that the primary endpoint of this trial would really be
more focused on histology endpoints rather than MRI-PDFF or anything like that? Yes, that's it for me.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Thank you, Benoit. Maybe I can start with an introduction. And Pascale, please add on this there. So I think, again, I'm going back to what we said,
which I think is a very important key point for this program. By targeting AMP kinase, we believe that the metabolic benefit is really one piece of
the global efficacy of the products there. As David illustrated on during his talk, AMP kinase activation could lead to much broader benefit in terms
of inflammatory and fibrogenesis benefit there. And so that's why to really answer almost the 2 questions in parallel, we believe that as a monotherapy
based on the data that we have today, we believe that as a monotherapy, 770 could really deliver a very attractive and interesting really benefit
because on top of what we've seen today, there will be more really with this direct effect on inflammation and fibrosis.

Not to say that the combination is not important, not at all because, indeed, that's the second lesson learned from this trial. While, I mean, the
product is safe as we've seen there, it's a new mechanism. And again, I highlighted, we know that it can be safely combined with other products.
So I think it's part of our plan as well to investigate early on really the combination there to the most common class that are currently under
development there. And so clearly, really, histology will be the next logical step there in terms of endpoints because as you have understood, I
mean, there is more than this benefit on the liver fat mass, thanks to the activation, thanks to this innovative new mechanism activating AMP kinase
there. Maybe, Pascale, do you want to give some more thoughts there?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
No, no. I think you answered the 2 questions, Thomas. But for sure, this proof-of-concept, we use MRI-PDFF to look at the liver fat content because
the duration of the study was pretty short and it was really the first experiment of this AMP kinase activator in this indication. But for sure, the Phase
IIb study will have histology as endpoint because we absolutely need to characterize the effect of this drug on inflammation and fibrosis and
ballooning. So yes, we agree.

Next question comes from Bertrand Delsuc from Biotellytics.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Yes. To start with the safety side, could you tell us if you had seen or observed some weight gain? I'm just thinking about that with the increased
insulin sensitivity. And the second point, if you could just provide us with the rate of moderate AEs because you say that the TEAEs are mostly mild
or moderate, but if you could just have a little bit more granularity on the moderate. And then I have a follow-up.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Thank you. Pascale, do you want to take these 2 questions, please?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
I will do it. Yes. So well, so far, we don't have all the data on the weight gain, but we don't believe that there is any -- that it is -- we believe that it
is weight neutral. We haven't seen any signal towards weight gain.

And the second question is regarding the adverse events. So yes, as we mentioned, and most of the adverse events were mild, some of them were
moderate, but they were very well balanced between the group. And to give you a little bit more granularity, most of the adverse events were from
the gastrointestinal tract with a slight increase in the incidence of patients presenting those adverse events in the PXL770 group, whatever the
dose. And most of them presented some diarrhea or some flatulence, but nothing outstanding and perfectly in line with what we have seen in the
Phase I. An additional adverse event was (inaudible) but also fairly balanced between all the group, including the placebo. So there is really no
specific finding in the moderate adverse event.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Okay. But just about the rate, it is -- what the order of magnitude, 15%, 20%?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
It was around 20%.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Yes. Okay. And then a follow-up on the dose, which is, let's say, something that comes to the mind when one looks at the data. I looked at the data
during your single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose in the Phase I. And what you described in there was a dose proportionality up to
375-milligram and then an inverse dose proportionality from this point up to 500-milligram, which was the maximum dose that you had characterized
and that you used here also in Phase IIa. And I was just wondering how one should interpret the data we have now with Phase IIa as compared to
the data you had in healthy volunteers during the 70% window. And also, I was wondering if the 250-milligram BID was not some sort of proxy for
this 375 milligram? So if you could have some more insight on how one should think about that.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Yes. Okay. So basically, so just to acknowledge that we don't have the full PK data of this trial, just the top line, and we focused on efficacy and
safety. So of course, we need to look at the data. But from what we know really from the Phase I and the PK/PD, which was in this NAFLD population,
is that the PK is roughly similar really between the healthy and this NAFLD population. So it should be also the case for this Phase II.

Then you are right, so there was a linear absorption really up to 375 as we saw in the Phase I, and then we started to see really a saturation of the
absorption. Still, you had a higher AUC and Cmax with the 500, but not, of course, disproportional to what you could obtain at the lowest dose. So

                                                                                                                                                                             
 this is why when we assessed the dose to be used in this trial, we thought that still it would be worth really going up to 500 just based on the
correlation that we did, and we feel that this would be in the range of the most efficacious dose there.

And then going back to BID and once a day, again, there were, of course, some key consideration because we tested this BID regimen in the Phase
I. And of course, we saw, as you can imagine, some difference, as David explained, with most of the AUC being between 0 to 12 hours there. But
really a big part of the consideration, as I mentioned earlier, was that the fact that with this mechanism, where you need to activate AMP kinase
and you've got multiple ways to activate it or to prevent its deactivation, we really wanted to test whether a twice-daily regimen from a mechanistic
standpoint could lead to a different benefit. And so that's what really has driven the decision to test 2 different doses or to test the same daily dose
with 2 different dose ratio.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Okay. But in your opinion, with respect -- with the data, okay, you didn't have -- you didn't have all the data and you didn't analyze all the data, but
well, as you said, the option for further exploration of higher doses remains on the table, right?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Well, for the PK/PD, we have all the data, and of course, we model the PK/PD analysis. Then for the Phase IIa, of course, we need to have the data.
And then going forward, of course, we can think about different options there. But clearly, the 500-milligram OD, I think -- or sorry, QD, so once-a-day
has really delivered really good results with a good safety. And so that will definitely be one of the dose to be considered going forward.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Okay. Sure. And about the exposure this time, well, I didn't have the time to parse all the posters, but do you have some preclinical data that could
describe a bit more the therapeutic effect through a longer exposure?

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
So you mean...

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Longer-term exposure, like multiple weeks?

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Yes. Yes, because your mouse experiment in your NASH mouse were 8 weeks, something like that, if I'm correct. And then it's hard to really interpret
the potentiality with longer exposure in human this time.

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
So maybe I can take that, Thomas. Yes. I think it's an interesting question. I think it's -- many mechanisms in NASH require multiple weeks of treatment
in rodents to see substantial benefits. So we're basically starting with the sort of model from what other people have done. But with this mechanism,
as with several others, it does take on the order of, say, 4 to 8 weeks to have strong effects on NASH in the preclinical rodent models. What that
translates into in terms of the duration of treatment you need in humans to see histologic benefits is not really known, and it may differ from one
                                                                                                                                                                             
 mechanism to the next. But I think it does suggest that because rodents are not humans and things may happen faster in rodents, it does suggest
that you would need to go out beyond, say, 24 weeks to see substantial efficacy through this mechanism as well.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Okay. And the last one for me. About the results on HbA1c, well, you presented the data, okay. But I also notice that in the placebo group, among
the patients that had type 2 diabetes or diabetes, there was a lower proportion of patients under therapy, 70% versus 85%, 90% in the PXL groups.
And I was wondering if there could be any impact of this imbalance on the interpretation of the data.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
Pascale, do you want to answer this one?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Yes, there is a very slight imbalance. I don't believe that this may have an impact on the result, but we need to look at individual data for that. And
so far, we don't have the data. But yes, that's a good comment. But yes, we need to look at all individual data, yes.

Thomas Kuhn - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director
I should add here that despite patients were diabetic or not, I mean, all of them were very well treated and controlled because you've seen that
the baseline A1c, so that's why I think Pascale said that it's likely that there will be no impact because clearly -- and we have the data on SPG as
well. They were at roughly 110 at baseline. So showing to us that, I mean, this was extremely well-controlled patients in any case.

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Yes. And as well, we have exactly the same profile for the SPG, which is also a good sign, SPG being much more variable with A1c. But when you
have both parameter moving in the same way, I think it gives a lot of more consistency to the data. So honestly, we don't believe that. We will look
at it, yes.

David E. Moller - Poxel S.A. - Executive VP & Chief Scientific Officer
Yes. If I could just add. I think the most important point, if you look closely at the Slide 15, is that the baseline HbA1c is really the same across all
these groups despite the fact that there might be some slight differences in the percent that are treated versus treated with diet only.

Bertrand Delsuc;Biotellytics;CEO, Founder
Yes. Yes. Okay. And yes, just perhaps a last one. The patient populations were patients likely with NASH. Do you have, let's say, just a rough idea of
what could be the equivalent F score in this patient population? Would it be only, I mean, F0/F1 or F2?

Pascale Fouqueray-Grellier - Poxel S.A. - Co-Founder and Executive VP of Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
Well, I think it is pretty difficult to speculate on that. Based on the data that we have, I think it's very difficult to speculate on the, well, histological
status of the subject.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the corporate update from Mesoblast. An announcement has been lodged with the ASX and also available on the home
and investor pages at www.mesoblast.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

Before we begin, let me remind you that during today's conference, the company will be making forward-looking statements that represent the
company's intentions, expectations or beliefs concerning the future events. These forward-looking statements are qualified by important factors
set forth in today's announcement and the company's filings with the SEC, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such
forward-looking statements. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent the company's views only as of the date of this webcast and
should not be relied upon as representing the company's views of any subsequent date. The company specifically disclaims any obligations to
update such statements.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Dr. Silviu Itescu, Chief Executive of Mesoblast. Dr. Itescu, please go ahead.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Thank you, and thank you all for joining us on this call today. With me is Dr. Fred Grossman, our Chief Medical Officer.

As you've seen from our press release, we have received a complete response letter from the FDA for our investigational product RYONCIL
(remestemcel-L) for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease in children. Despite an overwhelming 9:1 vote of the FDA's
ODAC panel and the available data support the efficacy of remestemcel in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease,
the FDA determined that an additional randomized controlled trial in children or adults is needed for approval. Given the very high mortality in
children with this disease and the absence of any approved treatments in children under 12, we will request urgently a Type A meeting within 30
days where we will discuss a potential accelerated approval with a commitment post-approval for a confirmatory trial. We are confident in this
approach, given the strength of the ODAC vote.

Also announced today is that we are set for the second interim analysis of the Phase III trial of remestemcel in COVID-19 ARDS patients. We've
surpassed the necessary number of patients for that second interim analysis, and we expect to release the results of that in early November. Body
of evidence around the use of remestemcel-L in inflammatory indications with high mortality risk continues to build. Our randomized controlled
Phase III trial evaluating remestemcel and up to 300 patients with ARDS is well underway. The inflammatory condition that affects ARDS patients
with COVID-19 has a similar mechanism of action as the cytokine storm in steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease. And we will continue to
build the clinical data that supports evidence of efficacy of remestemcel in these life-threatening inflammatory conditions.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Thank you for joining this call. And operator, we'll now take questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Tanushree Jain at Bell Potter Securities.

Tanushree Jain - Bell Potter Securities Limited, Research Division - Healthcare and Biotech Analyst
A really disappointing outcome today, I'm surprised. The FDA looks like they've totally ignored their own advisory committee with the 9:1 vote. A
couple of questions for you, Silviu. One, I think the announcement also mentioned further about providing a scientific rationale to demonstrate
the relationship of potency measurements of the product's biologic activity. Can you throw some more light on that aspect?

And secondly, you just mentioned about the Type A meeting to discuss a potential accelerated approval with a post-approval study. Can you clarify
exactly what you're proposing to the FDA? And what kind of a post-approval study are we looking at? Does that include children? Or would it still
be what we had expected, just adults?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Thank you, Tanu. So we -- at the ODAC panel meeting, we, in fact, initiated a discussion around what type of post-approval trial might look like in
adults with steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease. And we have a protocol design that is well underway comparing high-risk adults against
-- with remestemcel against standard of care. The randomized controlled trial is well powered for an outcome measurement that we've been
proposing to the FDA.

Perhaps Dr. Grossman, would you like to comment on that a bit further?

Fred Grossman - Mesoblast Limited - Chief Medical Officer
Yes. And I think as Dr. Itescu mentioned, this is going to be a comparative study of remestemcel versus standard of care. And we'll be using an end
point that certainly takes into consideration survival because survival is really the primary end point that we're focusing on.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Thanks, Fred. I might address the second question that you asked, Tanu, which was questions around scientific rationale for specific potency assays.
And as again, we discussed at the recent ODAC meeting, the mechanism of action by which the cells work to reduce inflammatory activation in
various diseases involves multiple pathways. The strength of the technology is, in fact, the multiple pathways that the cells are able to modulate
to reduce severe inflammatory disease. And understanding those pathways and the mechanisms involved continue to be an important objective
that we are in complete agreement with the FDA on, and we will continue to refine our assays to relate them to clinical outcomes in both GVHD
as well as in COVID-19 ARDS.

The type of abnormal cytokine production in COVID-19 ARDS, this has been now quite clearly defined in large prospective studies. Those are the
type of biomarkers that we will be evaluating in our current ongoing randomized controlled trials. And we will seek to demonstrate that we can
reduce those abnormal biomarkers in parallel with the characteristics of the product in vitro. Those are major objectives as we try to relate product
biologic characteristics with clinical outcomes.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Tanushree Jain - Bell Potter Securities Limited, Research Division - Healthcare and Biotech Analyst
Right. So if I'm clear, so I mean, basically, the complete response, that is telling you that the FDA wants you to do this randomized study before
approval, not as a post-approval study. So you're going to propose still to the FDA to give you approval for pediatric and still meet the adult trial
as post-approval. Is that what you're expecting?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
We expect to have discussion around accelerated approval on the basis of the existing data with commitments for a post-approval, randomized
controlled trial in adults, predominantly, that supports -- continues to support the evidence of efficacy of the product in this high-risk patient
population as was discussed and voted on by the ODAC panel.

Tanushree Jain - Bell Potter Securities Limited, Research Division - Healthcare and Biotech Analyst
Okay. And how long will this proposed trial take approximately to complete?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
We will be discussing with the agency an accelerated approval. That is -- we're talking about in the -- before completion of such a trial. So the 2 are
unrelated. That's precisely why we're having a Type A meeting within the next 30 days to have agreements on the potential pathway to accelerate
approval before any other trial gets performed.

Tanushree Jain - Bell Potter Securities Limited, Research Division - Healthcare and Biotech Analyst
And so just with the COVID-19 trial, given we potentially could have that completed in December and results in first quarter '21, I guess, given the
situation, that potentially could become, like, the first label or first approval for the product. I mean how do you see that as a possibility?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Well, that is where the largest unmet need is today, of course. The pandemic is not going away anytime soon. In fact, as we can all see, second wave
numbers are increasing all over the United States and Europe right now. And the #1 cause of mortality of this dreadful disease is acute respiratory
distress syndrome and an overactive immune system that is destroying the lung whilst trying to battle this virus. The randomized controlled trial
of up to 300 patients has been done in conjunction with the FDA and with the full agreement that it's appropriately powered to potentially meet
an approvable end point should we show a reduction in mortality, along the lines that we showed in the pilot study several months ago.

The potential pathway for approval is under an experimental use authorization, which is specifically designed to fast-track product that has benefit
in diseases of major national importance such as this pandemic. And that's certainly our plan, and it's what we are very much focusing on as we

The next question is from the line of Kennen MacKay at RBC Capital Markets.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
Condolences on the CRL and the decision here. Just wondering, as it relates to feedback from the FDA, as it relates to the tie between efficacy and
outcomes or manufacturing and outcomes, one of the lines in your press release mentioned additional data needed behind the mechanisms here.
I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit and potentially what that would imply as it relates to end points in a Phase III trial.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Sure. They don't relate to end points. So the end points are very clear. We met the primary end point of a GVHD trial of day 28 overall response.
We've demonstrated substantial benefits for these children who have high risk of mortality, and we've seen a very good survival in the Phase III
trial. What the FDA is looking for is continued understanding of how the product characteristics in vitro allow us to predict patient outcome using
biomarkers like peripheral blood tests, specific tests. And those are ongoing assays that will continue to be refined and identified in all of our trials
of the product, irrespective of the disease.

And in particular, in the COVID-19 Phase III trial of up to 300 patients, we are collecting blood samples in a very orderly manner. And we are examining
a wide range of biomarkers, which are known to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 virus and the immune system's response to that virus.
And those biomarkers, we will be evaluating to see whether our treatment impacts and reduces those inflammatory biomarkers, which will have
a direct correlation with the biologic properties of our products.

And so this is the natural way by which novel technologies evolve and the way mechanism of action get clarified. But in terms of the primary and
secondary end points, those are well defined, well understood, and they relate to the disease process itself. I'd like to add something. I just want
to add something. Condolences are not necessary. We're focused on getting our treatments to patients in need. And in this case, patients of COVID
ARDS as well as GVHD. We're confident moving forward in our plans to bring both of those to the market, of course, with COVID pending the
outcome of the COVID trial and with GVHD pending the discussions with the FDA. And we're confident that we'll find -- we'll have an accelerated
path forward for that.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
And maybe just a follow-up. Thank you for that explanation. Silviu, maybe just on sort of linking the relationship between the potency measurements
and the sort of biologic activity, you certainly talked about COVID-19 ARDS quite a bit and some of those assays. But what about in steroid-refractory
acute GVHD? Are there some additional assays for measurements that can be done there? And sort of what are those?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
We talked about some of those at the recent ODAC meeting. And those assays are very similar in both COVID-19 and in GVHD. They relate to
measurements of the ability of T cells to be activated or macrophages to be activated or be switched off. So they're related to factors that our cells
make that control the overactive elements of the immune system.

Kennen B. MacKay - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD & Co-Head of US Biotechnology Research
Okay. And certainly looking forward to a very catalyst-rich Q4 here.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor.

Louise Alesandra Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division - Senior Research Analyst & MD
So I had a few. First one is, what do you expect this additional trial to look like? I know it was already asked, but I just wanted to see maybe if you
could provide more color here. And then as you were speaking to the FDA on your submission for BLA, what was their view on the approval for
pediatric and adults? How is that trending?

And then last question we get asked a lot here is on your manufacturing. Has it been inspected? How has that been prepared? I know you're
potentially having supply also already in place with one of your partners, but I'm just curious, from your own side, the manufacturing, how has that
gone?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
That's a lot of questions, Louise. I'm trying to -- look, in terms of manufacturing, we're very comfortable with manufacturing. We've got a lot of
inventory built. And we have the release criteria, and the various assays have been generally agreed to with the FDA. And we're very comfortable
that we have a well-manufactured product that's under good control.

The question around the additional study in adults with GVHD, we touched on that at the ODAC panel. Fred touched on that a little bit a moment
ago when he talked about that in greater detail. The objective has always been to extend any approval from the pediatric group to also include
adults with steroid-refractory GVHD and in particular, the adults with the most severe forms, Class III/IV CD disease, where existing therapies really
don't work very well, where mortality remains very high. And that will be the target population that we will be focusing on in the adult study,
randomized, controlled against approved than the standard of care because those therapies out there not only do not adequately treat or address
the high mortality in these adults, but they also have a high degree of safety concerns. And as you heard at the ODAC panel, the FDA did not have
any safety concerns regarding remestemcel.

And that's also important to consider. Many complete response letters relate to adverse events and safety concerns. That is not the case here. There
were no safety issues. The issue in hand was that the single trial in children was an open-label trial with no control arm, and that's because the
physicians do not want to enroll a pediatric study and have children exposed to unapproved drugs in a control arm. So it's really not feasible to do
a randomized controlled study in children. It is feasible in adults. And we are precisely proposing doing that study in adults after potentially receiving
an accelerated approval.

Fred, would you like to add anything to that?

Fred Grossman - Mesoblast Limited - Chief Medical Officer
Yes. This is a study that we've discussed with expert advisory board, with experts in adult GVHD. This is powered to detect the difference between
remestemcel and standard of care, taking advantage of our existing data and what we know about remestemcel, which has very substantial efficacy
and safety, particularly around survival and durability of response. We'll be discussing this in detail with the FDA so that we plan to move forward
rapidly.

Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Cohen at Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jeffrey Scott Cohen - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research
So a few questions. So firstly -- and I think this all refers to GVHD. So firstly, is the FDA required to accept your Type A request? And would you
expect that to occur within 30 days?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
We expect to have that within 30 days. That's correct. Yes.

Jeffrey Scott Cohen - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Okay. And they -- are they required to accept the request on behalf of the company?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
We believe so.

Jeffrey Scott Cohen - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Okay. Got it. And then it sounds like what you're saying is -- what you've spoken about previously is adult study to follow up. It looks like the
commentary in the press release from the agency talks about children and/or adults. Should we assume that at the moment, your plan is to proceed
with what you had previously discussed with them as far as an adult-only study?

Fred Grossman - Mesoblast Limited - Chief Medical Officer
Yes. I think we plan to move forward with an adult-only study because, as Silviu mentioned before, it's very difficult to do a study in children,
especially with this level of severity. So we are focusing on an adult study. And if positive, we assume that we would move forward with indications
in both children and adults. There's an unmet need here in both of those populations. And so we move forward in those areas.

Jeffrey Scott Cohen - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Okay. Which kind of leads me to my third and final question. So the FDA is, I guess, based on your commentary, they're under the belief that they
or you or someone could justify doing a control arm with a pediatric population and/or an adult population.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Well, as you would have heard at the ODAC panel, the principal investigator of the open-label pediatric study, Professor Kurtzberg, was adamant
that it is not feasible to execute a randomized controlled trial in children. Despite the tremendous unmet need and the dismal, very dismal prognosis
in these children, with nothing approved under the age of 12, it is not feasible. And so that's why we are confident in our discussions with the FDA
around an accelerated approval, providing that we commit to a post-approval clinical trial in adults that is randomized and controlled.

Operator
I am afraid that the last question we have time for today is from the line of RK of HCW.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Swayampakula Ramakanth - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD of Equity Research & Senior Healthcare Analyst
And I know it's disheartening, but I also see that you're hopeful and want to move forward, which is excellent. And so regarding getting back to
the FDA and trying to have a conversation with them to convert this into an accelerated approval, just trying to understand, has this happened
before? Because we have certainly had companies go to court with FDA, but I'm just trying to understand what is the advice you're getting from
your experts regarding trying to convince them to change their decision.

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
There are many examples. Many, many examples. This is a process. This is simply the beginning of a process of a dialogue and a discussion. And
this is a natural course event. That's why Type A meetings are there. And we'll have that discussion 30 days from now. The data and the results and
the decision of the experts on the ODAC panel are clear, overwhelmingly positive. And it's really about coming to agreement on how to best use
those data and make the product available to children who need it whilst, at the same time, providing the additional data in adults that gives the
FDA further, further information on the effectiveness of the product in totality.

And again, it's very important that we continue to focus as well on the adult trial in COVID-19 ARDS, which is a well-powered and well-designed
randomized controlled trial in up to 300 patients, which, if positive, will provide further evidence of the strength of this technology in severe
inflammatory conditions. That trial is enrolling and we'll -- we expect that it will complete enrollment by the end of this year with the overall primary
end point of day 30.

Fred Grossman - Mesoblast Limited - Chief Medical Officer
Yes. And I would just note that it's not disheartening. It's disheartening to children, we'll just have to wait a little bit longer for this potential treatment.
And so we're viewing this as a bit of a short delay before we can move this forward. So that's the disheartening part. We are not disheartened. We're
confident moving forward.

Swayampakula Ramakanth - H.C. Wainwright & Co, LLC, Research Division - MD of Equity Research & Senior Healthcare Analyst
One other additional thing that FDA identified was trying to come up with an assay to demonstrate potency measurements in relationship to the
biologic activity. Do you think you would have that assay ready by the time you get in front of the FDA for the Type A meeting so that you can
convince them that you have one of their requirements?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
No, no, no. We already have these assays. But what the FDA would like us to continue to do is to relate the in vitro assays to in vivo clinical outcomes.
And we are doing that in all of our studies, particularly in the COVID-19 ARDS trial. So it is -- the objective is to continue to collect biomarker, in vivo
biomarker data that explains the assays that are already in place.

Operator
And that was the final question for today. So can I please pass it back to you for any closing comments at this stage?

Silviu Itescu - Mesoblast Limited - Founder, CEO, MD, Chairman of Scientific Advisory Board & Executive Director
Sure. Thank you very much. And as Fred has said several times, we are continuing to work with the FDA closely and with the investigators and with
patients to bring this very important anti-inflammatory product to market. Children with steroid-refractory GVHD under the age of 12 have a high
mortality and have nothing approved. And the data provides evidence of strength and efficacy of the product in that patient population. We will

                                                                                                                                                                             
 be meeting with the FDA shortly to explore an accelerated approval pathway for these children. And in addition, we will be continuing to build
the evidence in randomized controlled studies in GVHD as well as in the much larger opportunity and concern around COVID-19 ARDS as that trial
meets its next interim analysis result and moves to completion by the end of this year.

Thank you, everybody. We appreciate you joining us this morning.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Conagra Brands Fiscal '21 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please also
note today's event is being recorded.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Brian Kearney, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.

Brian Kearney - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Head of IR
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements today. While we are making
those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of the risk factors are included in the
documents we filed with the SEC.

Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that
exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information
on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in either the earnings press release or the earnings slides, both
of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.

Finally, please note that we expect to report our second quarter earnings in early January this fiscal year. We will issue a press release with the
specific details later this calendar year. With that, I'll turn it over to Sean.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. I hope that you and your families are
continuing to stay safe and healthy. Today, I'm going to unpack the quarter for you and then share our perspective on how the evolving consumer
environment is shaping longer-term demand for our products. So let's get started.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Building upon our impressive momentum at the end of last year, we're off to a strong start in Q1. We exceeded our expectations and saw broad-based
strength across the portfolio. We will detail today we believe our business is well positioned to continue to deliver strong results, both in the near
and long term.

The transformation we've undertaken over the past 5 years by following our Conagra Way playbook to perpetually reshape our portfolio and
capabilities for growth and better margins has proven critical in enabling us to respond to the changing dynamics in the current environment. Our
modernized portfolio, commitment to innovate and agile culture have allowed us to respond to the increased consumer demand and changing
preferences today and position us to deliver meaningful growth into the future.

Our robust performance has also helped us to get ahead of our expected deleveraging cadence. As Dave will detail later, we expect to reach our
net leverage ratio target of 3.5x to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal 2021.

Paying down debt has been a capital allocation priority in recent quarters, but you also know that we are committed long-term to a balanced
capital allocation approach. Given our progress on deleveraging and because we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business, our
Board has increased our quarterly dividend by 29% to $1.10 on an annualized basis. And as I'll discuss more, we also continue to invest in the
business.

Our performance reflects the great work our team has accomplished during these challenging times. In particular, I want to recognize the thousands
of hard-working Conagra team members on the front lines. Their extraordinary efforts in simultaneously keeping employees safe and maximizing
our supplies have made it possible for us to continue to meet the needs of our communities, customers and consumers, and I couldn't be prouder
of them.

Let's get into the business update. As the table on Slide 7 shows, our execution in the quarter enabled us to exceed our expectations across the
board. We delivered organic net sales growth of 15%, adjusted operating margins of 20.2%, adjusted EPS of $0.70. We ended the quarter with a
net leverage ratio of 3.7x compared to 4.0x at the end of Q4.

During the first quarter, we continued to drive significant growth in each of our 3 retail segments. Total Conagra retail sales grew 12.9% year-over-year,
driven by double-digit growth in snacks, frozen and staples. Importantly, our higher-margin, nonpromoted volume contributed significantly to
this growth. And not only did we grow at a great rate, we expanded our presence with consumers and gained share. We increased household
penetration by 100 basis points and category share by 30 basis points.

Slide 9 demonstrates how our investments in e-commerce over the last several years continued to yield results in the quarter. Strengthening our
e-commerce capabilities has been an area of focus for us, and we're seeing the fruits of our labor. Our e-commerce retail sales have recently
demonstrated impressive growth and, over the past 5 quarters, have consistently outpaced total industry e-commerce growth.

First quarter also saw continued strong innovation momentum. Our steadfast commitment to the Conagra Way playbook has enabled us to
consistently exceed our goal of having 15% of total retail sales each year coming from products launched within the past 3 years. And of course,
as our overall sales continue to increase, this percentage of sales represents a larger absolute dollar amount. Even during these challenging times,
we remain committed to delivering innovation to our customers and consumers. Our growth is rooted in innovation, and we are driving category
performance.

Slide 11 highlights 2 examples in big growth areas: frozen and snacks. Let's take a look at the frozen single-serve meals category. As compared to
our fiscal '17, this category experienced a $575 million increase in retail sales during the 52-week period ended August 30. Our innovation in frozen
single-serve meals over the past 3 years is unmistakable. We've generated almost 100% of that category's growth over the same period.

We've applied this proven strategy to our snacks portfolio and are seeing similar category-driving growth. Slim Jim has consistently gained share
and has the top position in dollar sales for meat snack innovation. And to top it all off, our new Slim Jim Savage stick has the #1 velocity in all meat
snacks. Given this track record, our innovation success has earned tremendous credibility with our customers.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And our most recent slate of innovation is enabling us to further enhance that credibility. Slide 12 shows some of the highlights, offerings packed
with modern food attributes and bold on-trend flavors. Some of these began launching in Q4, and we're pleased with their early end-market
performance. We will continue to roll these out throughout the year.

We're also excited about the innovations shown here on Slide 13. We're using our broad portfolio to extend high-growth brands beyond their
legacy forms. By leveraging our existing capabilities, we're extending Gardein and Healthy Choice into attractive categories with large profit pools:
soups, jerky and salad dressing. And these 2 success stories are even going 1 step further, co-branding single-serve frozen meals.

Slide 14 shows some examples of what else we have on deck for the balance of fiscal '21. Clearly, we are not slowing down on our innovation
agenda.

I'd now like to take a moment to touch on recent performance in our 3 domestic retail domains, starting with frozen. Slide 15 shows our impressive
performance in total frozen during the quarter. This business is over $5 billion in annual retail sales, and it grew 13.5% in the quarter, with double-digit
growth in single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and plant-based meat alternatives.

With respect to frozen vegetables, recall that last quarter, we were supply-constrained in Birds Eye. Demand was in excess of our available capacity,
exacerbated by a brief plant shutdown to keep our employees safe and healthy. I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, our Birds Eye
plants are at full capacity and, as the quarter progressed, we qualified external manufacturers to supplement our capabilities.

While our consumption in frozen vegetables grew 0.7% in the quarter, our shipments grew at a much faster rate as retailers started rebuilding
inventories. Sitting here today, Birds Eye, which holds the #1 position in the category and has over twice the category share compared to the closest
branded competitor, is very well positioned as we enter the important holiday season.

Turning to snacks. Snacks business delivered another impressive quarter of growth, 14.6% versus the previous year and 22.7% on a 2-year basis.
In meat snacks, we are working to maintain our growth and capabilities by investing in expanded capacity at our Troy, Ohio plant. To be clear, this
investment is not a reaction to the near-term environment, but a decision made pre-COVID and rooted in our longer-term outlook for the business.

Our meaningful staples results, as shown on Slide 17, demonstrate that this domain remains extremely relevant. Our staples business grew retail
sales 11.6% year-over-year, with strong performance across our portfolio of iconic brands.

I'd now like to turn to our perspective on the evolving environment and what we see going forward. While we hope and expect that the most acute
and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind us, we believe that recent shifts in consumer behavior, coupled with macroeconomic trends, suggest
that at-home eating will remain elevated for some time. We also believe that we are very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.

I'll unpack these points a little bit more, but we see consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes, driven by COVID-19, that suggests the
arrival of a sustained shift in eating habits. We also know from prior recessions that an economic downturn typically leads to a permanent increase
in at-home eating, even when economic growth returns. These consumer trends affect everyone in our industry, but we believe that Conagra is
uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment.

Our portfolio is well-developed in the eating occasions that have seen the most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating, and our portfolio
delivers against the cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting. We're attracting more new buyers than our peers, and consumers are choosing
to stick with Conagra and come back for more. With our proven track record of innovation, we believe we will continue to attract new consumers
and deliver food that meets their evolving needs.

Let's drill down on some of the proof points that underpin these expectations, starting with why we believe at-home eating will remain elevated.
As you know, the vast majority of our sales are sourced from the United States. And unfortunately, the U.S. economy has been greatly affected by
the pandemic. Unemployment in the U.S. remains high, the pace of new job growth is decelerating and many U.S. households have limited savings.
To understand how this recession may impact Americans' eating habits going forward, we looked back at how behavior changed in the wake of
the last recession.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Slide 20 shows the percent of eating occasions that have been sourced at-home in the U.S. since 2007. As you can see, the '08 recession was a
catalyst for a 200 basis point increase in at-home eating occasions, from 80% to 82% over the course of 4 years. Importantly, that rate held steady
long after the recession ended, even when the economy returned to growth and employment hit record levels.

With the COVID-19 disruption, we've already seen another 200 basis point increase to 84% in the 4 months from March to June 2020. History as a
guide, the increased percentage of at-home eating occasions should persist even when economic growth returns.

And as Slide 21 shows, as consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently. They're preparing
to be at home for an extended period of time. Consumers are investing in their houses, their home gyms, their entertainment systems and their
kitchens.

In the chart on the right, you can see that consumers are also spending more time cooking. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more
complex mediums. In other words, they're upgrading their culinary skills. We don't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment,
kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon. This all leads to 1 conclusion: more time at home and, as a result, more consumption of food
at home.

The pivot to remote work is also a meaningful development. The significant workplace disruption we've experienced over the past several months
has given way to a new normal remote workforce. The chart on the left of Slide 22 shows how even baseline projections see office vacancies
remaining elevated over the coming years. Furthermore, on the right, we can see how remote workforce adoption has significantly increased.

More working from home means more lunch is eaten at home and real opportunity for a portfolio like ours. And while we're well past the initial
spike of stock-up behavior when COVID first emerged in the U.S. in March, at-home eating occasions have remained elevated, even increasing over
the most recent 2 weeks of data.

As the chart on Slide 23 shows, we're continuing to see a double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail versus the prior year. During
our first quarter, food and beverage industry sales rose an impressive 14%. While we don't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going
forward, we do know that we're entering the cold and flu season and that winter weather could limit the appeal of outdoor restaurant dining in
many parts of the country. All of these factors give us reason to believe that the elevated levels of at-home eating should persist. We also believe
that Conagra is uniquely positioned to benefit.

Let's start with Slide 24. Total at-home meals have increased almost 6% in the 3 months ending July 2020, that's almost 7 billion meals. When you
take a closer look at this growth by daypart, the increases in meals and dollars are skewing toward lunch and dinner. And as you know, Conagra is
well-developed in both of these dayparts.

The chart on the right shows that, in fact, our portfolio overindexes in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch compared to the overall mix. And
whether a consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to the test, or heat and eat, Conagra's diverse portfolio
can deliver a solution for every need in every daypart. So we are very well positioned for when and how people are eating more at home.

On Slide 25, you can see the benefits. Over 80% of our categories have been growing in line or faster than the industry. And as I mentioned earlier,
we've been gaining share within those categories. This is further demonstrated by Slide 26, which shows we're attracting new buyers at a faster
rate than any of our peers.

Slide 27 shows that the buyers we're attracting overindexed to the coveted millennial and Gen X generations. As you might expect, we're seeing
substantial millennial expansion in frozen but, just as importantly, we're seeing their expansion in snacks and staples as well.

Because of this, we're creating the groundwork for future growth above the category and above our peers. We're attracting younger generations
and building superior consumer lifetime value. And not only are more consumers trying our products, they're liking them and coming back for
more.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Take a look at the chart on Slide 28. New trier repeat rates for our consumers, whose first trial was in March or April, have remained steady at above
50%.

That stickiness can be seen further in the chart on Slide 29. Not only are repeat rates sustaining, but the depth of repeat is improving. More consumers
are choosing to repurchase a Conagra product 2 or more times compared to where we were a year ago.

When you compare us to our peers, we are at the front of the pack. Slide 30 shows that we rank above nearly all of our peers in the total percentage
of repeat purchasers, demonstrating the improved stickiness of our brand loyalty.

So in summary, executing our disciplined Conagra Way playbook over the last 5 years has grown our portfolio, grown our capabilities and positioned
us to meet the evolving needs of our consumers, while earning the confidence of our customers. We believe that at-home eating will remain
elevated for some time as consumers seek affordable and convenient meals that meet the needs of their new normal. And we are confident that
Conagra is well positioned to see sustained benefit.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Thanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through our first quarter financial performance and outlook before opening the line for
questions.

Let's look at the P&L highlights for the quarter, which are captured on Slide 33. As Sean discussed, we started fiscal '21 on a strong note. Elevated
demand across our retail segments, coupled with effective execution, enabled us to exceed expectations for net sales, profitability, free cash flow
and deleveraging.

Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales and organic net sales for the first quarter were up 12.1% and 15%, respectively. Adjusted gross
margin increased 244 basis points to 30.7%. Adjusted operating margin increased 450 basis points versus the same period a year ago, reaching
20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.5% to $647 million. And adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70, exceeding our first quarter
guidance.

Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, the 15% increase in organic net sales
was driven by a double-digit increase in volume as well as favorable impacts from price/mix. Favorable pricing and sales mix both contributed to
the growth in the quarter. Price/mix also included a benefit of approximately 70 basis points from a favorable change in estimate associated with
a prior period trade expense accrual.

The organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and foreign exchange. As we pointed out in the past, the impact from
divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as we anniversary the divestiture closing dates. Including the impact of the recently announced
divestiture of HK Anderson, the full year impact of divestitures is expected to approximate 100 basis points.

Turning to Slide 35. You'll find a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. We saw continued strong growth in each of the company's
3 retail segments on both a reported and organic basis. The net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers increasing their at-home food
consumption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which benefited our 3 retail segments but negatively impacted the Foodservice segment.

In the quarter, our Grocery & Snacks segment reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%. This segment benefited as consumers continue to
purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home eating experience. Segment growth in shipments this quarter exceeded
growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands such as Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic.

The Refrigerated & Frozen segment also experienced strong growth in the quarter. The 19% increase in organic net sales is a testament to our
innovation and modernization efforts and the role our portfolio plays in meeting the needs of today's consumers. This segment also experienced

                                                                                                                                                                             
 shipment growth greater than consumption growth in the quarter, primarily as a result of Birds Eye. As Sean mentioned, we increased capacity in
frozen vegetables during the quarter, enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories.

The International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than we forecasted, with each of the segment's regions posting
growth higher than projected, primarily from COVID-related demand. Our Foodservice segment reported a 20.3% organic net sales decline, primarily
driven by a volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower restaurant traffic. This marks an improvement from last quarter as some restaurant traffic began
to rebound.

Slide 36 outlines the drivers of the 450 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in the first quarter. Our margin levers, such as realized
productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove a 610 basis point increase in the quarter. The specific drivers of this increase are:
supply chain realized productivity of 290 basis points, price/mix of 250 basis points, cost of goods sold synergy of 90 basis points and operating
leverage of 60 basis points. Also, the net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 basis points.

Cost of goods sold inflation was approximately 3.1% in the quarter, which negatively impacted gross margin by 220 basis points. We incurred
approximately $34 million in cost of goods sold directly related to our COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted gross margin by 150 basis
points. Our A&P rate was favorable by 20 basis points in the quarter due to the favorable sales leverage. As on a dollar basis, we spent approximately
the same amount as last year's first quarter.

Finally, our SG&A rate was favorable by 190 basis points. Approximately 160 basis points was related to the combination of fixed cost leverage on
higher net sales and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel. The remaining 30 basis point
improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in stock-based compensation expense.

We have certainly seen a margin benefit driven by the current environment. But it's also clear to see that we have made great progress improving
the underlying operating margin of the business.

Slide 37 shows our adjusted operating profit and margin summary by segment in the first quarter. Our total company adjusted operating profit
increased 44.2% to $541 million in the quarter. Importantly, all 4 of our segments reported margin expansion in the quarter.

These results demonstrate the tremendous operating margin improvement in our domestic retail and International segments. While the Foodservice
segment saw a decline in operating profit dollars, the segment reported a 28 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin. This was aided by
lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending in the quarter.

Slide 38 highlights that our adjusted EPS increased 62.8% to $0.70 in the quarter, primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit
associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion.

Turning to Slide 39. You will see a summary of our synergy capture since the close of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition in fiscal '19. After exceeding
our fiscal '20 goal of $180 million, we have continued our strong synergy progress in the beginning of fiscal '21.

In Q1, we captured an incremental $35 million in savings, bringing total cumulative synergies through the end of the first quarter to $219 million.
To date, the majority of our synergies have been in SG&A, and we expect the majority of the remaining synergies to be reflected in cost of goods
sold. We're very pleased with our progress and are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment.

Slide 40 shows the strong progress we've made to improve our balance sheet and cash flow. From the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the
second quarter of fiscal '19 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal '21, we have reduced total gross debt by more than $1.9 billion, resulting
in total net debt of $9.2 billion.

As of the end of the first quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.7x, down from 4x at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Given our income, we
are confident in our ability to achieve our targeted leverage ratio of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of fiscal '21. In addition, we remain committed
to solid investment-grade credit ratings.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Also, our cash flow remains very strong. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operating activities increased $78 million or 37% compared to the
prior year. At the same time, we increased our investment in the business by increasing CapEx by $39 million or 36%. Supply chain investments
and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of our year-over-year spend as we continue to optimize our network and drive brand growth.
This has led to our free cash flow increasing $39 million, 38% to last year's first quarter.

As a result of our strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, we have greater financial flexibility to both invest in the business and return cash
to shareholders. This, coupled with consistent successful execution of our strategic priorities and our ongoing confidence in the long-term strength
of the business, led our Board to approve a 29% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on an annualized basis.
This action is consistent with our commitment to maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation. As we return cash to shareholders, we are
also increasing our investments in the business, as evidenced by the 36% increase in Q1 CapEx I just mentioned.

Turning to Slide 42. You will find a summary of our outlook. As you've heard both Sean and me share this morning, we believe there is much to
look forward to in the quarters ahead. However, the dynamics surrounding COVID-19 continue to make forecasting with specificity a challenge.
What we can share is that we anticipate a continuation of elevated retail demand throughout the second quarter. We are, therefore, providing
second quarter guidance, as noted in the release and on this slide.

We expect organic net sales growth of plus 6% to plus 8% in the second quarter. We expect adjusted operating margin in the second quarter to
be in the range of 18% to 18.5%. Relative to Q1 operating margin, we expect less operating leverage benefit, and we expect to increase our marketing
support, both above the line and below the line. We believe there are opportunities to increase brand-building investments where capacity permits.

Given these operating margin factors, along with expected improvement in below-the-line items, we expect to deliver second quarter adjusted
diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.70 to $0.74. We expect to reach our leverage target of 3.5 to 3.6x by the third quarter of
this fiscal year. Of course, our ability to achieve these targets assumes continued performance end-to-end by our supply chain.

Finally, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal '22 targets this morning. Note that the impact of the HK Anderson divestiture is small enough that we
will not be adjusting our fiscal '22 EPS targets for the divestiture.

Thanks for listening, everyone. That concludes my remarks. I'll now pass it to the operator to open it up for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I guess, first off, just so I get some clarity on this. You talked about, obviously, in some of your key segments, shipments exceeding what we would
have expected around takeaway, given some rebuilding of retailer inventory. Can you tell us about how much that might have benefited overall
organic sales growth in the quarter? And I assume that's really just retailers getting back to more normalized levels as opposed to volume that
needs to sort of come out of future quarters?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Andrew, let me take that. It's Dave. Yes, we came out of Q4, the retailer inventory levels were below historic levels. We talked about that
specifically Birds Eye, but we also saw it in several of our grocery brands as well. So the shipments above consumption in the first quarter were
clearly just getting the inventory levels back to the days of supply that they're looking for.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 As we sit here -- as we ended Q1 and we sit here today, retailer days of supply are still below historic levels. So when you look at shipping above
consumption, it wasn't now we're sitting here with heavy retailer inventories, we're still below historic averages. So it was a catch-up from where
inventory levels were at the end of Q4.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
And just as part of that, would you expect the 6% to 8% organic sales growth in fiscal 2Q to be, all in, more in keeping with what consumption
trends are? Or above what you anticipate consumption will be because of some continued retailer inventory build? And then I've just got a quick
follow-up.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Right now, we're forecasting that shipments will pretty much be in line with consumption for Q2.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. And then you mentioned just recently stepping up marketing spend, both above and below the line, where you have the capacity to do so
to sustain some of these new consumers. I guess, how do we think about the -- maybe the magnitude of the step-up as it relates to how much of
the fiscal 1Q sort of earnings upside could well flow through to the full year? I guess, I'm asking how much the company is willing to, or it feels
makes sense to, commit to really stepping up marketing because it would seem a small price to pay in the end, if you can hold on to some of these
consumers longer term.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the year ago period
because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why.

First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the capacity to supply
new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of investments where the evidence is
quite strong regarding ROI: investments to increase consumer awareness around our new innovations and investments to further build out our
e-commerce business.

So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got -- and it repeats, but you've got to
get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. On e-commerce, we've learned that what we
get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in supporting the business is very important because
it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel future purchases.

So if we were to seed this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say, we believe that supporting innovation and
e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then converts to loyalty.

But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hardworking, but it's also very,
very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer investments. So that's been our
playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it.

In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher in Q2 than Q1
because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase. And we know that if we
create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 In terms of flow-through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the reason a year
ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the back half will give us.

So the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously, it puts a limit
on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right now.

Operator
Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I know it's difficult to be precise, but is there a way to think about what your operating margin might have been if not for the trade load and the
accounting catch-up for 4Q's promo expenses?

Dave, I appreciate you mention that operating leverage added only 60 basis points to the margin this quarter. It's a bit less than I might have
expected, but maybe your mix was also helped by the load or maybe you're just using so many co-packers, the benefits of the margin from higher
volume just wasn't that big. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the sort of underlying operating margin was excluding some of those maybe
nonrecurring benefits?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Ken, let me -- to your point, we're not going to get precise with that. On my remarks, I tried to unpack it in a lot of detail, so you could understand
all the different components and drivers. And so you should be able to say, ""Okay, this is more of a COVID-related item."" For example, we specifically
quantified our COVID-related expenses, so you can look at that.

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big part of our
margin improvement, is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue.

So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core operating
margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID. So I'm not going to give you an exact number but, generally, I feel like we're on track, and the
Pinnacle synergies was an important part of that improvement.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. And Ken, this is Sean. Let me just recharacterize, too, the shipment perspective from Q1 because I would think -- I want you to think of it a little
bit differently than some of the language you used. I would characterize it as a partial replenishment. We exited Q4 with retailer inventories highly
depleted, way below kind of normalized levels in terms of stock on hand. That began to rebuild in the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments
being ahead of consumption.

But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of days on hand.
That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway is higher. So when the
pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops. So that's how I want you guys to think about the retail inventory dynamics.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
It makes sense. And then a quick follow-up. Can you update us, Sean, on how the Birds Eye brand, in particular, is doing? You're doing so well with
so many of your categories and brands, I don't mean to pick on this one. It's just -- at least what we're seeing in Nielsen data, it seems like this one's
a little more sluggish. Maybe private label's taking a little more share than what I might have thought. So I'm just curious if you can give us a status
update on that brand in particular.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Happy to talk about Birds Eye, for sure. Birds Eye, as you heard in the prepared remarks, is running flat out right now. We've got, thankfully,
the plants are running well, and we are growing.

But what you're seeing in consumption, it does -- it kind of confuse because the natural level of demand is actually higher than that. But what you
see going on right now is we are approaching the all-important holiday season for vegetables. And it is very, very important to retailers to have
vegetable inventory during the holidays.

So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture, but it's also some
retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory. Because, as you can imagine, when consumers go to buy
their Thanksgiving dinner and vegetables and they can't get what they want, that becomes a very emotional -- a very negative emotional event,
and we don't want that, nor do our retailers.

Operator
Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Congratulations on a strong start to the fiscal year. I know we're still early in this year, but my attention -- I think a lot of people's attention is on
your goals for next year, the fiscal '22 targets, which increasingly look like they're more achievable than I think many of us thought they would be
a few quarters ago.

On the sales side of that, your 1% to 2% CAGR, if I flatline the back half of the year, I've got to take 2022 organic sales down 9%-or-so to get that
multi-year CAGR down to 1% to 2%. And obviously, that sort of reset in '22, contrast with the narrative you guys built with a lot of really interesting
data, by the way, on why some of this consumption may remain elevated.

So how do I put those two? Or should I just step back and say, ""Listen, you put that target out a while ago, you're not going to move it at this point
in time. There may be some conservatism on the sales side?""

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I think we're not going to try to speculate on what would we be looking like without COVID. But what we are dealing with is kind of what we've
got. So the environment we've got, we believe, sets us up well, as we laid out in the prepared remarks today. And it puts us in a position to reaffirm
kind of where we are with '22 with our long-term algorithm. And that's really -- that's all the commentary, I think, we've got on '22.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Okay. Okay. But you were confident you'd get there without it. And obviously, you're expecting COVID to be a boost. So there -- at least the sales
side looks like it's more firmly in grasp. On the cost side, I appreciate the detail you ran through on the incremental COVID expense.

You also mentioned there's COVID-related savings. Are those sort of net neutral? Or when the dust settles here, will you have benefits of incremental
costs falling the way sort of netted against the headwinds of incremental costs coming back in? Or could it actually be net favorable, net headwind
all in?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So we laid out the $34 million in COVID-related costs in our margin bridge. SG&A includes savings just because people are working from home,
there's just not as much travel and expense. And so -- but that's less -- that's probably 1/3 of the $34 million in terms of the favorability.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
But I think, long term, one of the key points we're making today is our -- the work we've done for 5 years, then intersecting with COVID, leads to a
very positive long-term NPV. Because we are getting these new consumers into our brands, they are discovering all the innovations that we've
launched really over the last 4 or 5 years, including the new stuff.

They're liking it, and they're converting to repeaters. And their depth of repeat is strong. And that's -- we're going to be at '22 before we know it,
and then we'll be thinking of what comes beyond '22. And certainly, all of -- we're trying to maximize that outlook.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Jason, can I just add one more? Just -- so the $34 million is in cost of goods sold, which affects gross margin. The, call it, $9 million, $10 million of
favorability is in SG&A.

Operator
Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst
Just a follow-up on the topic of gross spending. You mentioned that you have the opportunity to reinvest. And you mentioned that working media
will continue to be in that 2% of sales level. And you also mentioned investments in e-commerce. I'm wondering if you could talk about how much
you are reinvesting away from the working media, whether it's e-commerce or other capabilities on the expense line. And how meaningful that
reinvestment is or has been accelerating during this period? And I have a follow-up.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Keep in mind, the A&P that we've got these days is almost all working A&P. A lot of the inefficiency that we found in A&P was in nonworking dollars,
survey data, market research, commercial production, things like that, that has been really cleaned up. And what remains is very hardworking, but
it's -- keep in mind also, the vast majority of it is in digital.

I think, at CAGNY, we said over 80% of it was a digital spend. So that spans everything from e-commerce investments to digital, social advertising,
working direct-to-consumer messaging, all of that stuff.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And so we've hovered, historically, over the last number of quarters about 2%. This last quarter, we were below that because we were
supply-constrained, and it didn't make sense to pour more A&P on top of a supply constraint. But now we're getting some flexibility there, and
you'll see a more normalized level for what a Q2 usually is. Dave, do you have...

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Let me just add to that, David, just to maybe help a little bit. So if you look at the Q2 guide for operating margin versus where we came in at
Q1 at 20.2%, let me give you kind of a few pieces here that will help you also on the marketing investment.

So first, the trade change in estimate, that's about 40 basis points. So if you take that out, because that's a benefit to the first quarter, that's just
going to stay for the year. The difference between Q1 and sort of the midpoint of the 2Q guide is about 150 basis points lower.

That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and slotting and
then growth-focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investments. So that's of the 150 basis points that kind
of splits into those buckets.

So the Q2 A&P level will be up versus Q1. It will be more consistent with the level that we saw Q2 a year ago for A&P.

And just a quick follow-up. I know there's always limitations to how much you can comment on M&A, but there have been companies out there
successfully selling stuff that they own to help their future growth and getting surprisingly good prices. I'm thinking of a Hain Celestial here, just
for example.

You have the tax asset. Things seem to be going slowly there on the divestiture front. Do you look at this as an opportunity-rich environment for
you to perhaps reduce exposure to lower-growing categories that might hamper your growth after COVID?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I guess, David, the answer is it depends. And as you look back over the last several years, we've been fairly active, both on inbound and
outbound stuff. And we also are keenly aware we have this tax asset, and it does expire at some point.

But we've said pretty consistently from the beginning, it's not necessarily strategic to use the tax asset for the sake of using the tax asset. It's strategic
if we use it to create value. And as we think about candidates, that could be outbound. It always comes down to can we get a value for it that is
above what we see as the intrinsic value?

So we've made very good progress on our deleveraging, getting ahead of our expectations there. It's not as if we feel pressure such that we would
ever liquidate an asset below its intrinsic value. We don't feel that pressure. But if a good valuation came along, we've -- as you've seen from our
practices in the past, that would be something we would look at as well.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
I just wanted to follow-on a couple of earlier questions, just to get a sense of what you think the inventory rebuild added to the first quarter. And
then also to understand the perspective around 2Q and why inventories are not rebuilding back to normal levels.

And I want to understand is your production ability because it sounds like it has caught up. And can you keep pace with demand right now? Is
there any sort of limitation to you building inventory in 2Q?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, the inventories have started to rebuild, Chris, but demand remains elevated. And it's really a category-by-category dynamic in terms of by
pull-through takeaway versus capacity at the plant.

So as I pointed out, between manufacturing capacity overall and retailer inventories being light, it's still -- we're still in catch-up mode. But some
categories are in good shape, and those are the ones where we have the ability to really maximize demand. But it's not, by any stretch, normalized
yet because the lift, the demand remains very strong.

And now, of course, we're going into a season where all the outdoor dining is going to go away in a lot of parts of the country and cold flu season
is upon us, so it's plausible that demand can even lift from here. You saw that in the 1 chart I showed on occasions, even the most recent weeks
beginning to tick back up.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then would you say what inventory added to the first quarter?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. We shipped above retailer inventory, you're talking about?

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
Yes. How much your shipments were above consumption? Like what that added to your sales growth in the first quarter?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Our shipments were, I think, it was 600 basis points difference between shipment and consumption.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
Okay.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
(inaudible) Retailer. Yes. (inaudible)

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then, I just have -- yes, right. Got it. Okay.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Right.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then just one other quick question on new product contribution. It's quite high. There are a lot of companies that have had to put off some
new product launches, and I think now they're starting to get back to it.

But I just want to understand, as I think about the next couple of quarters, do you have a normal rate of new productivity that's occurring? And are
you seeing that kind of delayed at all because of the environment that we're in? Just the robust growth occurring at retail.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I'd tell you, Chris, back when this all hit in March, April, I would have thought more customers would have wanted to delay some of the new
innovations. But given our track record and given, especially in frozen and snacks, the way our innovation has driven category growth and the way
we've really accounted for almost all of the share in some of our key categories in terms of growth, that demand from customers for our new
innovation remained extremely strong.

So a lot of our products have been going out the door. We've got more yet to go out the door. And the performance of those products in marketplace
have been strong. So we've been doing a combination to maximize supply of SKU rationalization, where it makes sense to do so, on brands like
Chef Boyardee, so we can maximize the volume we're putting out there.

But at the same time, we've been very strong on innovation, and it has been working. So that's strictly a function of how well our innovation does
in terms of velocities in the marketplace. We've got, if you look at some velocities, just new stuff that we've got out there, like Duncan Hines is a
brand we don't always talk about, we've got these new keto-friendly cups. And this is brand-new, and it's already got the #1 dollar velocity SKU in
that segment.

Our Slim Jim products, the velocity is just crushing it. Our Slim Jim Savage initiative is the #1 velocity in all meat snacks, and it's been the #2 velocity
in all snacks overall in the last 13 weeks. So these new products are not only going out the door, they are really performing.

Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages & Lead Consumer Staples
Analyst
So I just wanted to touch on costs. Can you just give us an update on kind of how you see things playing out in terms of some of the key commodity
costs? But more importantly, just wanted to get a sense on your thoughts around manufacturing and labor costs and kind of how you think about
that as you forward over the next several quarters.

Because we're hearing a lot from the industry, just people not showing up for work and, obviously, consumption remains elevated so co-packed
usage is going up and transportation costs are going up. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on just that whole bucket, if you could.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Nik, let me start and then, Sean, you can jump in. So for Q1, our overall inflation was 3.1% for the quarter. As we look going forward, we estimate
that, that overall inflation rate is going to come down more to kind of the low to mid-2% if you look going forward.

As you mentioned, there have been increases in spot rates for freight. Freight's about 10% of our overall cost of goods sold, but it's a very small
piece of our business because we contract for our freight. So clearly going to be an impact, but on an overall weighted basis, we think it's manageable.
And we have other favorability that we can offset that.

Yes, in terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but it's also our
suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire supply chain.

And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and then where we
are with supply. We're manufacturing full out at all our manufacturing locations, and we're really working closely with our suppliers to make sure
we understand where they are with their lead times on ingredients and packaging and all the things that are critical for us to be able to make a
finished product. So Sean, anything?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, I think you covered it.

Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche.

Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
So not to belabor the topic you've already addressed in part, but can you just maybe take a step back and give us a bit more in perspective as to
how you landed at that 2% of sales A&P or working media level just being the right one? I think everyone would agree it's working well now. But
I think that a lot of investors watching your story from the outside and watching other CPG companies lean in to today's demand with more elevated
A&P investment, carry some concerns about your top line having more headwinds when the music stops on at-home demand, so to speak.

And I appreciate everything you said about demand staying elevated for longer, potentially, but I guess it's important to -- from what I hear, to
address that concern head-on because it's a question for would-be investors who like what you're doing on the innovation, on the trial and near-term
repeat fronts but are more concerned about your brand equity as being strong enough going forward to cement long-term loyalty.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Steve, happy to talk about that. I feel like I talk about this every quarter. My consistent encouragement to investors is to think about our
brand-building work holistically. It starts with the design of the product and the packages, and then it includes all the investments we make to
create a connection between our consumer and the brands. Some of that connection happens in the grocery store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens
on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together.

But a big piece of our first investment and how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages. If you look at
the single-serve frozen meal slide that I shared today, we are now multiple years into reinnovating that category. And it started with major investments
in the food quality and the packaging. And then on top of that, we layered investments in A&P and investment with our retailers.

And when we got to year 1 of our success there, the question we got is, how are you going to wrap this? What's going to happen in year 2 when
your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after year after year, and we've
retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments we make holistically in brand building,
from product to package to retailer investments to A&P, works very hard and is driving sustained performance.

What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing -- thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line. And that a good rate
of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past, is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep within most of the companies
that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of nonworking dollars and then working dollars that are still used
against traditional tools like in-line TV media, things like that.

We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily digital. And what
we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by the way, as you know, is not just
deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for us.

With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about because the last
thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and we're not doing that. But what
we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if
you look at the average and it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much higher than that. And those are brands usually where we
get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity.

Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. Look, I think that's a comprehensive, like, overview. I guess the only thing that -- I guess the follow-up I'd have is that in this environment, other
companies are making incremental investments that they might not have been making in the -- in a more normal environment. And I guess, are
you just saying that those incremental investments just generally are not going to have a good ROI? Or they're not happening in your competitive
set? Or just how do we square that circle?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I guess what I'm saying is give us credit for the incremental investments that we already had in our baseline. If you look at the slides today that
show the sheer breadth and depth of the innovation we put out there, it's unmatched. So those are investments, and those are investments that
have already been in place and are already underway.

And then, on top of that, we layer investments to drive awareness of those new innovations. So the investment profile is holistic, and it includes
building out one of the leading, if not the leading, innovation portfolios in all the industry and all the costs associated with doing that.

And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
So just 2 quick ones for me. First, on the dividend, we've got a step-up today, which, in a sense, kind of makes up for the time that the dividend has
been frozen. So at this level, at this payout ratio, should we think of it this now as kind of a normalized ratio? And assuming there's growth going
forward, we're at a level where we can grow the dividend consistently?

And then the second one is just in terms of the outlook or the lack of outlook for this fiscal year and the kind of the question around visibility, is
the lack of visibility more around cost relative to revenues? Because it seems like you've got a pretty reasonable amount of confidence in the
environment and your ability to drive revenue in this environment. So just curious if the inability to give guidance is more driven by cost versus
revenues?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
So Brian, let me hit the dividend. So Sean and I communicated in our remarks, our cash flow, our deleveraging cadence are ahead of expectations,
and we're confident we're going to hit the targeted 3.5 to 3.6x leverage ratio in the third quarter. We're also confident in the long-term strength
of the business as we reaffirm fiscal '22.

So based on this progress and the Board's confidence and the structurally higher earnings power for the company, the Board approved a dividend
from $0.85 to $1.10 annualized. And this increase moves us towards the longer-term historic payout ratio of 45% to 50%. So that's what I'll tell you
related to the dividend. Sean, anything for the second part on the long-term with the outlook?

Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Actually, more related to fiscal '21, just trying to understand not having guidance for the full year, is the lack of visibility more a function of visibility
on the top line? Or is it a function of cost?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. I think one of the things you got to keep in mind is we're -- we obviously are in the middle of a pandemic. So to some degree, the upper control
limit on revenue is how much can we get out of the plants. And the -- how much we get out of the plants is a function of how healthy we can keep
people.

So this is a very contagious disease. We're trying our best. We're doing a great job. But every day, when we come in, we start our day at 8:00 in the
morning going through a review of how healthy our people are in every single one of our facilities. And every day brings us new information, and
the team is doing a great job of managing that. But it's a variable, and it's a variable that makes it very hard to predict how these quarters unfold,
which is why we're taking this, at this point in time, quarter-by-quarter.

           2. Staples business grew retail sales 11.6% YoverY with strong performance across portfolio of iconic brands.
   F. Perspective on Evolving Environment:
      1. While Co. hopes and expects that most acute and severe impact of COVID-19 is behind CAG, believes recent shift in consumer
         behavior coupled with macroeconomic trends suggests at-home eating will remain elevated for some time.
        a. Believes Co. is very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.
      2. Sees consumers experiencing and making lifestyle changes driven by COVID-19 that suggests arrival of sustained shift in
         eating habits.
        a. Knows from prior recessions that economic downturn typically leads to permanent increase in at-home heating, even
             when economic growth returns.
        b. These consumer trends affect everyone in industry.
            i. Believes CAG is uniquely positioned to benefit substantially from this environment.
           ii. Portfolio is well developed in eating occasions that have seen most significant and sustained shift to at-home eating.
          iii. Portfolio delivers against cooking behaviors that consumers are adopting.
        c. Attracting more new buyers than peers.
            i. Consumers are choosing to stick with CAG and come back for more.
        d. With proven track record of innovation, believes Co. will continue to attract new consumers and deliver food that meets
             their evolving needs.
      3. Believes at-home eating will remain elevated.
        a. Vast majority of sales are sourced from US.
            i. Unfortunately US economy has been greatly affected by pandemic.
           ii. Unemployment in US remains high, pace of new job growth is decelerating and many US households have limited
               savings.
        b. 2008 recession was catalyst for 200 BP increase in at-home eating occasions from 80% to 82% over course of four years.
            i. Importantly, that rate held steady long after recession ended, even when economy returned to growth and employment
               hit record levels.
        c. With COVID-19 disruption, already saw another 200 BP increase to 84% in four months from March to June 2020.
            i. Increased percentage at-home eating occasion should persist even when economic growth returns.
        d. As consumers are saving money in their food budgets, they are using their dollars and time differently.
            i. They are preparing to be at-home for extended period of time.
           ii. Consumers are investing in their houses, home gyms, entertainment systems and their kitchens.
          iii. Consumers are spending more time cooking.
          iv. Data is showing that consumers are tackling more complex meals.
           v. Doesn't expect these upgrades to homes, at-home entertainment, kitchens and cooking skills to go away anytime soon.
          vi. This all leads to more time at home and thereby more consumption of food at home.
        e. Pivot to remote work is meaningful development.
            i. Significant workplace disruption experienced over past several months has given way to new normal remote workforce.
           ii. Even baseline projections see office vacancies remaining elevated over coming years.
          iii. Remote workforce adoption has significantly increased.
          iv. More working from home means more lunches eaten at home, real opportunity for portfolio like CAG's.
      4. While Co. is well past initial spike of stock-up behavior when first emerged in US in March, at-home eating occasions have
         remained elevated, even increasing over most recent two weeks of data.
        a. Continuing to see double-digit percent increase in total industry sales at retail YoverY.
        b. During 1Q, food and beverage industry sales rose impressive 14%.
            i. Doesn't know exactly how these growth rates will trend going forward.
           ii. Co. does know that it is entering cold and flu season and winter weather could limit appeal of outdoor restaurant dining
               in many parts of country.
        c. All aforementioned factors gives Co. reason to believe that elevated levels of at-home heating should persist.
            i. Believes CAG is uniquely positioned to benefit.
      5. Total at-home meals increased almost 6% in three months ending July 2020; almost 7b meals.

                                                                                                                                                                             
             a. Increases in meals in dollars are skewing towards lunch and dinner.
                i. CAG is well developed in both of these dayparts.
            b. Portfolio over index is in dinner and is almost at parity for lunch vs. overall mix.
                i. Whether consumer wants to cook from scratch to put those newly developed culinary skills to test or heat and eat,
                   CAG's diverse portfolio can deliver solution for every need in every daypart.

                i. Seeing their expansion in snacks and staples.
               ii. Due to this Co. is creating groundwork for future growth above category and above peers.
              iii. Attracting younger generations and building superior consumer lifetime value.
          7. New trier repeat rates for consumers, whose first trial was in March or April have remained steady at above 50%.
            a. Repeat rate is sustaining.
            b. Depth of repeat is improving.
            c. More consumers are choosing to repurchase CAG product two or more times vs. where Co. was a year ago.

        a. Favorable pricing and sales mix contributed to growth.

                                                                                                                                                                             
             b. Price/mix included benefit of approx. 70 BP from favorable change in estimate associated with prior period trade expense
               accrual.
          2. Organic net sales increase more than offset headwinds from divestitures and FX.
            a. Impact from divestitures continues to diminish sequentially as Co. anniversaries divestiture closing dates.
            b. Including impact of recently announced divestiture of HK Anderson, full-year impact of divestitures is expected to
               approximate 100 BP.
   C. Net Sales By Segment:
      1. Saw continued strong growth in each of Co.'s three retail segments on reported and organic basis.
        a. Net sales increase was primarily driven by consumers' increasing their at-home food consumption due to COVID-19
           pandemic, which benefited three retail segments, but negatively impacted Foodservice segment.
      2. Grocery & Snacks reported organic net sales growth of 20.7%.
        a. This segment benefited as consumers continued to purchase convenient, shelf-stable products to enhance their at-home
           eating experience.
        b. Segment growth in shipments exceeded growth in consumption as retailers began rebuilding inventories on brands like
           Hunt's, PAM, Duncan Hines and Vlasic.
      3. Refrigerated & Frozen experienced strong growth.
        a. 19% increase in organic net sales is testament to innovation and modernization efforts and role Co.'s portfolio plays in
           meeting needs of today's consumers.
        b. Experienced shipment growth greater than consumption growth, primarily due to Birds Eye.
        c. Increased capacity in frozen vegetables during qtr., enabling retailers to start replenishing their inventories.
      4. International segment's 13.1% organic net sales growth came in stronger than forecasted, with each of segments' regions
         posting growth higher-than-projected, primarily from COVID-related demand.
      5. Foodservice segment reported 20% organic net sales decline, primarily driven by volume decrease of 24.2% due to lower
         restaurant traffic.
        a. This marks improvement from last qtr. as some restaurant traffic began to rebound.
   D. Operating Margin:
      1. Adjusted operating margin expansion 450 BP.
      2. Margin levers like realized productivity, price/mix, operating leverage and synergies drove 610 BP increase.
        a. Specific drivers of this increase are:
            i. Supply chain realized productivity 290 BP.
           ii. Price/mix 250 BP.
          iii. COGS synergies 90 BP.
          iv. Operating leverage 60 BP.
        b. Net impact of divestitures, FX and other items negatively impacted operating margin by 80 BP.
        c. COGS inflation was approx. 3.1%, which negatively impacted GM by 220 BP.
            i. Incurred approx. $34m in COGS directly related to COVID-19 response, which negatively impacted GM by 150 BP.
        d. A&P rate was favorable by 20 BP, due to favorable sales leverage, as on dollar basis, Co. spent approx. same amount as
             1Q20.
        e. SG&A rate was favorable by 190 BP, approx. 160 BP was related to combination of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales
             and reduced spending related to COVID-19 as employees worked from home and did not travel.
            i. Remaining 30 BP improvement was driven by synergies, partially offset by normal SG&A inflation and increases in
               stock-based compensation expense.
        f. Saw margin benefit driven by current environment.
            i. Made great progress improving underlying operating margin of business.
   E. Adjusted Operating Profit & Margin By Segment:
      1. Total Co. adjusted operating profit $541m.
        a. Increased 44.2%.
      2. Importantly, all four segments reported margin expansion.

                                                                                                                                                                             
             a. These results demonstrate tremendous operating margin improvement in domestic retail and international segments.
          3. Foodservice segment saw decline in operating profit dollars.
            a. Reported 28 BP increase in adjusted operating margin.
               i. This was aided by lower inventory write-offs and less trade spending.
   F. Adjusted EPS:
      1. Adjusted EPS $0.70.
        a. Increased 62.8%, primarily driven by increase in adjusted operating profit associated with net sales increase and margin
           expansion.
   G. Synergy Capture Since Close of Pinnacle Foods Acquisition:
      1. Closed Pinnacle Foods acquisition in FY19.
      2. After exceeding FY20 goal of $180m, continued strong synergy progress in beginning of FY21.

         total net debt of $9.2b.
      2. 1Q-end net leverage ratio 3.7 times.
        a. Down from 4 times at 4Q20-end.

      3. Cash flow remains very strong.
        a. Cash flow from operating activities increased $78m or 37% YoverY.
           i. At same time, increased investment in business by increasing CapEx by $39m or 36%.
        b. Supply chain investments and cost savings and capacity projects made up most of YoverY spend as Co. continues to
            optimize its network and drive brand growth.
           i. This led to free cash flow increasing $39m, 38% YoverY.
      4. Due to strong cash flows and progress reducing debt, Co. has greater financial flexibility to invest in business and return
         cash to shareholders.
        a. This coupled with consistent, successful execution of strategic priorities and ongoing confidence in long-term strength
            of business let Board to approve 29% increase in quarterly dividend to $0.275 per share or $1.10 per share on annualized
            basis.
           i. This action is consistent with commitment to maintaining balanced approach to capital allocation.
          ii. As Co. returns cash to shareholders, CAG is increasing investments in business as evidenced by 36% increase in 1Q
              CapEx.
    I. 2Q21 Outlook:
       1. Believes there is much to look forward to in quarters ahead.

            a. Impact of HK Anderson divestiture is small enough, that Co. will not be adjusting FY22 EPS targets for divestiture.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
I guess, first off, just so I get some clarity on this. You talked about, obviously, in some of your key segments, shipments exceeding
what we would have expected around takeaway, given some rebuilding of retailer inventory. Can you tell us about how much that
might have benefited overall organic sales growth in the quarter? And I assume that's really just retailers getting back to more
normalized levels as opposed to volume that needs to sort of come out of future quarters?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Andrew, let me take that. It's Dave. Yes, we came out of Q4, the retailer inventory levels were below historic levels. We talked
about that specifically Birds Eye, but we also saw it in several of our grocery brands as well. So the shipments above consumption
in the first quarter were clearly just getting the inventory levels back to the days of supply that they're looking for.

As we sit here -- as we ended Q1 and we sit here today, retailer days of supply are still below historic levels. So when you look at
shipping above consumption, it wasn't now we're sitting here with heavy retailer inventories, we're still below historic averages. So
it was a catch-up from where inventory levels were at the end of Q4.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
And just as part of that, would you expect the 6% to 8% organic sales growth in fiscal 2Q to be, all in, more in keeping with what
consumption trends are? Or above what you anticipate consumption will be because of some continued retailer inventory build?
And then I've just got a quick follow-up.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Right now, we're forecasting that shipments will pretty much be in line with consumption for Q2.

Andrew Lazar - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. And then you mentioned just recently stepping up marketing spend, both above and below the line, where you have the
capacity to do so to sustain some of these new consumers. I guess, how do we think about the -- maybe the magnitude of the step-up
as it relates to how much of the fiscal 1Q sort of earnings upside could well flow through to the full year? I guess, I'm asking how
much the company is willing to, or it feels makes sense to, commit to really stepping up marketing because it would seem a small
price to pay in the end, if you can hold on to some of these consumers longer term.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Andrew, let me give you some big-picture perspective on how we think about this and then we can talk a little bit about the
year ago period because I think it's important that you all understand what we intend to do, what we do not intend to do and why.

First off, before we ever contemplate an increase in our brand-building investments, 2 simple things have to be in place: one, the
capacity to supply new demand generation; and two, evidence of a strong ROI. Now on this latter ROI point, there are 2 types of
investments where the evidence is quite strong regarding ROI: investments to increase consumer awareness around our new
innovations and investments to further build out our e-commerce business.

So on new innovation, awareness, think of it this way, it's the precursor to trial. We do great at trial, but you got -- and it repeats, but
you've got to get that awareness in place. So as you saw in the data, our repeat performance has been stumped. On e-commerce,
we've learned that what we get out of it is directly a function of what we put into it. We've also learned, though, that speed in
supporting the business is very important because it enables you to build a beachhead in the e-tailing universe that helps us fuel
future purchases.

So if we were to seed this opportunity, someone else would build that beachhead. But overall, I'd say, we believe that supporting
innovation and e-commerce undoubtedly maximizes long-term value because it maximizes consumer penetration, which then
converts to loyalty.

But let's keep things in perspective about the level of support we're talking about. As you know, our A&P is very hardworking, but
it's also very, very efficient. And the rate has hovered around 2% over the last year or so, working synergistically with our retailer
investments. So that's been our playbook. It works, and we will continue to do it.

In this coming quarter, the spend is likely to be a bit higher than Q1 because we have more capacity and because it's usually higher
in Q2 than Q1 because it's the holiday season. And as the stores get crowded around holidays, we want to win at the point of purchase.
And we know that if we create awareness, the rest will take care of itself, which sets up a good back half and a good fiscal '22.

In terms of flow-through to the year, as you know, we're not guiding to the year. And the reason for that today is the same as the
reason a year ago, which is we're trying to manage this unpredictable environment quarter-to-quarter. We don't know what the
back half will give us.

So the key thing for us right now is keeping people healthy and keeping our plants running because if we can't do that, obviously,
it puts a limit on our ability to drive revenue, which then converts to profit. So we're just navigating this quarter-by-quarter right
now.

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.

Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I know it's difficult to be precise, but is there a way to think about what your operating margin might have been if not for the trade
load and the accounting catch-up for 4Q's promo expenses?

Dave, I appreciate you mention that operating leverage added only 60 basis points to the margin this quarter. It's a bit less than I
might have expected, but maybe your mix was also helped by the load or maybe you're just using so many co-packers, the benefits
                                                                                                                                                                             
 of the margin from higher volume just wasn't that big. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the sort of underlying operating margin
was excluding some of those maybe nonrecurring benefits?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Ken, let me -- to your point, we're not going to get precise with that. On my remarks, I tried to unpack it in a lot of detail, so you
could understand all the different components and drivers. And so you should be able to say, ""Okay, this is more of a COVID-related
item."" For example, we specifically quantified our COVID-related expenses, so you can look at that.

What I will say is that our realized productivity programs and supply chain are tracking very well. Our synergy capture, which is a big
part of our margin improvement, is on track and continues to be on track, and we're confident that will continue.

So when you look at those items and you compare to inflation and you strip it out at a high level, we're seeing improvement in core
operating margin performance as we expected to pre-COVID. So I'm not going to give you an exact number but, generally, I feel like
we're on track, and the Pinnacle synergies was an important part of that improvement.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. And Ken, this is Sean. Let me just recharacterize, too, the shipment perspective from Q1 because I would think -- I want you to
think of it a little bit differently than some of the language you used. I would characterize it as a partial replenishment. We exited Q4
with retailer inventories highly depleted, way below kind of normalized levels in terms of stock on hand. That began to rebuild in
the quarter, which obviously will lead to shipments being ahead of consumption.

But the net takeaway in terms of absolute status of inventories in trade right now is it's still larger than it is historically in terms of
days on hand. That's both because not every single category is flushed with capacity on the supply side, but also because the takeaway
is higher. So when the pull-through is more -- your days on hand drops. So that's how I want you guys to think about the retail
inventory dynamics.

Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
It makes sense. And then a quick follow-up. Can you update us, Sean, on how the Birds Eye brand, in particular, is doing? You're
doing so well with so many of your categories and brands, I don't mean to pick on this one. It's just -- at least what we're seeing in
Nielsen data, it seems like this one's a little more sluggish. Maybe private label's taking a little more share than what I might have
thought. So I'm just curious if you can give us a status update on that brand in particular.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Happy to talk about Birds Eye, for sure. Birds Eye, as you heard in the prepared remarks, is running flat out right now. We've got,
thankfully, the plants are running well, and we are growing.

But what you're seeing in consumption, it does -- it kind of confuse because the natural level of demand is actually higher than that.
But what you see going on right now is we are approaching the all-important holiday season for vegetables. And it is very, very
important to retailers to have vegetable inventory during the holidays.

So the supply constraints that you're seeing on Birds Eye are not just those that we've had in terms of our ability to manufacture,
but it's also some retailers prioritizing, preserving holiday inventory above, call it, late summer inventory. Because, as you can imagine,

                                                                                                                                                                             
 when consumers go to buy their Thanksgiving dinner and vegetables and they can't get what they want, that becomes a very
emotional -- a very negative emotional event, and we don't want that, nor do our retailers.

Operator
Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.

Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Congratulations on a strong start to the fiscal year. I know we're still early in this year, but my attention -- I think a lot of people's
attention is on your goals for next year, the fiscal '22 targets, which increasingly look like they're more achievable than I think many
of us thought they would be a few quarters ago.

On the sales side of that, your 1% to 2% CAGR, if I flatline the back half of the year, I've got to take 2022 organic sales down 9%-or-so
to get that multi-year CAGR down to 1% to 2%. And obviously, that sort of reset in '22, contrast with the narrative you guys built
with a lot of really interesting data, by the way, on why some of this consumption may remain elevated.

So how do I put those two? Or should I just step back and say, ""Listen, you put that target out a while ago, you're not going to move
it at this point in time. There may be some conservatism on the sales side?""

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I think we're not going to try to speculate on what would we be looking like without COVID. But what we are dealing with is
kind of what we've got. So the environment we've got, we believe, sets us up well, as we laid out in the prepared remarks today. And
it puts us in a position to reaffirm kind of where we are with '22 with our long-term algorithm. And that's really -- that's all the
commentary, I think, we've got on '22.

Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - VP
Okay. Okay. But you were confident you'd get there without it. And obviously, you're expecting COVID to be a boost. So there -- at
least the sales side looks like it's more firmly in grasp. On the cost side, I appreciate the detail you ran through on the incremental
COVID expense.

You also mentioned there's COVID-related savings. Are those sort of net neutral? Or when the dust settles here, will you have benefits
of incremental costs falling the way sort of netted against the headwinds of incremental costs coming back in? Or could it actually
be net favorable, net headwind all in?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So we laid out the $34 million in COVID-related costs in our margin bridge. SG&A includes savings just because people are
working from home, there's just not as much travel and expense. And so -- but that's less -- that's probably 1/3 of the $34 million in
terms of the favorability.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
But I think, long term, one of the key points we're making today is our -- the work we've done for 5 years, then intersecting with
COVID, leads to a very positive long-term NPV. Because we are getting these new consumers into our brands, they are discovering
all the innovations that we've launched really over the last 4 or 5 years, including the new stuff.

They're liking it, and they're converting to repeaters. And their depth of repeat is strong. And that's -- we're going to be at '22 before
we know it, and then we'll be thinking of what comes beyond '22. And certainly, all of -- we're trying to maximize that outlook.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Jason, can I just add one more? Just -- so the $34 million is in cost of goods sold, which affects gross margin. The, call it, $9 million,
$10 million of favorability is in SG&A.

Operator
Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI.

David Sterling Palmer - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst
Just a follow-up on the topic of gross spending. You mentioned that you have the opportunity to reinvest. And you mentioned that
working media will continue to be in that 2% of sales level. And you also mentioned investments in e-commerce. I'm wondering if
you could talk about how much you are reinvesting away from the working media, whether it's e-commerce or other capabilities
on the expense line. And how meaningful that reinvestment is or has been accelerating during this period? And I have a follow-up.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Keep in mind, the A&P that we've got these days is almost all working A&P. A lot of the inefficiency that we found in A&P was in
nonworking dollars, survey data, market research, commercial production, things like that, that has been really cleaned up. And
what remains is very hardworking, but it's -- keep in mind also, the vast majority of it is in digital.

I think, at CAGNY, we said over 80% of it was a digital spend. So that spans everything from e-commerce investments to digital, social
advertising, working direct-to-consumer messaging, all of that stuff.

And so we've hovered, historically, over the last number of quarters about 2%. This last quarter, we were below that because we
were supply-constrained, and it didn't make sense to pour more A&P on top of a supply constraint. But now we're getting some
flexibility there, and you'll see a more normalized level for what a Q2 usually is. Dave, do you have...

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Let me just add to that, David, just to maybe help a little bit. So if you look at the Q2 guide for operating margin versus where
we came in at Q1 at 20.2%, let me give you kind of a few pieces here that will help you also on the marketing investment.

So first, the trade change in estimate, that's about 40 basis points. So if you take that out, because that's a benefit to the first quarter,
that's just going to stay for the year. The difference between Q1 and sort of the midpoint of the 2Q guide is about 150 basis points
lower.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 That difference between Q1 and Q2 is roughly split among investments in A&P, in above-the-line investments in merchandising and
slotting and then growth-focused, cost of goods sold investments to support our innovation and capital investments. So that's of
the 150 basis points that kind of splits into those buckets.

So the Q2 A&P level will be up versus Q1. It will be more consistent with the level that we saw Q2 a year ago for A&P.

David Sterling Palmer - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst
And just a quick follow-up. I know there's always limitations to how much you can comment on M&A, but there have been companies
out there successfully selling stuff that they own to help their future growth and getting surprisingly good prices. I'm thinking of a
Hain Celestial here, just for example.

You have the tax asset. Things seem to be going slowly there on the divestiture front. Do you look at this as an opportunity-rich
environment for you to perhaps reduce exposure to lower-growing categories that might hamper your growth after COVID?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I guess, David, the answer is it depends. And as you look back over the last several years, we've been fairly active, both on
inbound and outbound stuff. And we also are keenly aware we have this tax asset, and it does expire at some point.

But we've said pretty consistently from the beginning, it's not necessarily strategic to use the tax asset for the sake of using the tax
asset. It's strategic if we use it to create value. And as we think about candidates, that could be outbound. It always comes down to
can we get a value for it that is above what we see as the intrinsic value?

So we've made very good progress on our deleveraging, getting ahead of our expectations there. It's not as if we feel pressure such
that we would ever liquidate an asset below its intrinsic value. We don't feel that pressure. But if a good valuation came along, we've
-- as you've seen from our practices in the past, that would be something we would look at as well.

Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Growe from Stifel.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
I just wanted to follow-on a couple of earlier questions, just to get a sense of what you think the inventory rebuild added to the first
quarter. And then also to understand the perspective around 2Q and why inventories are not rebuilding back to normal levels.

And I want to understand is your production ability because it sounds like it has caught up. And can you keep pace with demand
right now? Is there any sort of limitation to you building inventory in 2Q?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, the inventories have started to rebuild, Chris, but demand remains elevated. And it's really a category-by-category dynamic in
terms of by pull-through takeaway versus capacity at the plant.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So as I pointed out, between manufacturing capacity overall and retailer inventories being light, it's still -- we're still in catch-up
mode. But some categories are in good shape, and those are the ones where we have the ability to really maximize demand. But it's
not, by any stretch, normalized yet because the lift, the demand remains very strong.

And now, of course, we're going into a season where all the outdoor dining is going to go away in a lot of parts of the country and
cold flu season is upon us, so it's plausible that demand can even lift from here. You saw that in the 1 chart I showed on occasions,
even the most recent weeks beginning to tick back up.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then would you say what inventory added to the first quarter?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. We shipped above retailer inventory, you're talking about?

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
Yes. How much your shipments were above consumption? Like what that added to your sales growth in the first quarter?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Our shipments were, I think, it was 600 basis points difference between shipment and consumption.

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
Okay.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
(inaudible) Retailer. Yes. (inaudible)

Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then, I just have -- yes, right. Got it. Okay.

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Right.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Christopher Robert Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - MD & Analyst
And then just one other quick question on new product contribution. It's quite high. There are a lot of companies that have had to
put off some new product launches, and I think now they're starting to get back to it.

But I just want to understand, as I think about the next couple of quarters, do you have a normal rate of new productivity that's
occurring? And are you seeing that kind of delayed at all because of the environment that we're in? Just the robust growth occurring
at retail.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I'd tell you, Chris, back when this all hit in March, April, I would have thought more customers would have wanted to delay some
of the new innovations. But given our track record and given, especially in frozen and snacks, the way our innovation has driven
category growth and the way we've really accounted for almost all of the share in some of our key categories in terms of growth,
that demand from customers for our new innovation remained extremely strong.

So a lot of our products have been going out the door. We've got more yet to go out the door. And the performance of those products
in marketplace have been strong. So we've been doing a combination to maximize supply of SKU rationalization, where it makes
sense to do so, on brands like Chef Boyardee, so we can maximize the volume we're putting out there.

But at the same time, we've been very strong on innovation, and it has been working. So that's strictly a function of how well our
innovation does in terms of velocities in the marketplace. We've got, if you look at some velocities, just new stuff that we've got out
there, like Duncan Hines is a brand we don't always talk about, we've got these new keto-friendly cups. And this is brand-new, and
it's already got the #1 dollar velocity SKU in that segment.

Our Slim Jim products, the velocity is just crushing it. Our Slim Jim Savage initiative is the #1 velocity in all meat snacks, and it's been
the #2 velocity in all snacks overall in the last 13 weeks. So these new products are not only going out the door, they are really
performing.

Our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC.

Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages & Lead Consumer
Staples Analyst
So I just wanted to touch on costs. Can you just give us an update on kind of how you see things playing out in terms of some of the
key commodity costs? But more importantly, just wanted to get a sense on your thoughts around manufacturing and labor costs
and kind of how you think about that as you forward over the next several quarters.

Because we're hearing a lot from the industry, just people not showing up for work and, obviously, consumption remains elevated
so co-packed usage is going up and transportation costs are going up. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on just that whole
bucket, if you could.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Nik, let me start and then, Sean, you can jump in. So for Q1, our overall inflation was 3.1% for the quarter. As we look going
forward, we estimate that, that overall inflation rate is going to come down more to kind of the low to mid-2% if you look going
forward.

As you mentioned, there have been increases in spot rates for freight. Freight's about 10% of our overall cost of goods sold, but it's
a very small piece of our business because we contract for our freight. So clearly going to be an impact, but on an overall weighted
basis, we think it's manageable. And we have other favorability that we can offset that.

Yes, in terms of supply chain, remember, it's the end-to-end supply chain. So it's not just our manufacturing, it's our co-mans, but
it's also our suppliers. So to the extent that certain regions get hit with COVID and then there's impacts on labor, it impacts the entire
supply chain.

And so we're on that every day, every hour of every day, making sure that we understand kind of where we are with demand and
then where we are with supply. We're manufacturing full out at all our manufacturing locations, and we're really working closely
with our suppliers to make sure we understand where they are with their lead times on ingredients and packaging and all the things
that are critical for us to be able to make a finished product. So Sean, anything?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, I think you covered it.

Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche.

Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
So not to belabor the topic you've already addressed in part, but can you just maybe take a step back and give us a bit more in
perspective as to how you landed at that 2% of sales A&P or working media level just being the right one? I think everyone would
agree it's working well now. But I think that a lot of investors watching your story from the outside and watching other CPG companies
lean in to today's demand with more elevated A&P investment, carry some concerns about your top line having more headwinds
when the music stops on at-home demand, so to speak.

And I appreciate everything you said about demand staying elevated for longer, potentially, but I guess it's important to -- from
what I hear, to address that concern head-on because it's a question for would-be investors who like what you're doing on the
innovation, on the trial and near-term repeat fronts but are more concerned about your brand equity as being strong enough going
forward to cement long-term loyalty.

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Steve, happy to talk about that. I feel like I talk about this every quarter. My consistent encouragement to investors is to think
about our brand-building work holistically. It starts with the design of the product and the packages, and then it includes all the
investments we make to create a connection between our consumer and the brands. Some of that connection happens in the grocery
store. Some of it -- a lot of it happens on their phone or on their computer or digitally. All of it works together.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 But a big piece of our first investment and how we get sustained growth is in designing the right products and the right packages.
If you look at the single-serve frozen meal slide that I shared today, we are now multiple years into reinnovating that category. And
it started with major investments in the food quality and the packaging. And then on top of that, we layered investments in A&P
and investment with our retailers.

And when we got to year 1 of our success there, the question we got is, how are you going to wrap this? What's going to happen in
year 2 when your competition sees this and they emulate you and you've got difficult comps? Well, now we've done it year after
year after year, and we've retained just about 100% of the category growth in that space, which suggests that all the investments
we make holistically in brand building, from product to package to retailer investments to A&P, works very hard and is driving
sustained performance.

What sometimes strips people up is they get accustomed to seeing -- thinking that all brand building resides on the A&P line. And
that a good rate of A&P, which is kind of an artifact of the industry from the past, is a 4% rate or something like that. If you dig deep
within most of the companies that have had those kinds of rates, what you find is an extraordinary amount of nonworking dollars
and then working dollars that are still used against traditional tools like in-line TV media, things like that.

We are far beyond those days, and we've purged out that inefficient spend, and we've converted the old analog spend to heavily
digital. And what we find is when we put that profile together, and we do it with the work we do with retailers in store, which, by
the way, as you know, is not just deep discounting, that's not really the Conagra playbook anymore, it has been very successful for
us.

With respect to taking that investment up in any given COVID window, it kind of depends upon what brand we're talking about
because the last thing that would make sense would be to be spending a bunch of A&P on a brand that we're short on supply, and
we're not doing that. But what we've said in the call earlier today is if we have available capacity and if we have evidence of good
ROI, we'll absolutely increase the spend. So if you look at the average and it doesn't tell you much on some brands, the rate is much
higher than that. And those are brands usually where we get tremendous responsiveness, and we have available capacity.

Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. Look, I think that's a comprehensive, like, overview. I guess the only thing that -- I guess the follow-up I'd have is that in this
environment, other companies are making incremental investments that they might not have been making in the -- in a more normal
environment. And I guess, are you just saying that those incremental investments just generally are not going to have a good ROI?
Or they're not happening in your competitive set? Or just how do we square that circle?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
I guess what I'm saying is give us credit for the incremental investments that we already had in our baseline. If you look at the slides
today that show the sheer breadth and depth of the innovation we put out there, it's unmatched. So those are investments, and
those are investments that have already been in place and are already underway.

And then, on top of that, we layer investments to drive awareness of those new innovations. So the investment profile is holistic,
and it includes building out one of the leading, if not the leading, innovation portfolios in all the industry and all the costs associated
with doing that.

And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
So just 2 quick ones for me. First, on the dividend, we've got a step-up today, which, in a sense, kind of makes up for the time that
the dividend has been frozen. So at this level, at this payout ratio, should we think of it this now as kind of a normalized ratio? And
assuming there's growth going forward, we're at a level where we can grow the dividend consistently?

And then the second one is just in terms of the outlook or the lack of outlook for this fiscal year and the kind of the question around
visibility, is the lack of visibility more around cost relative to revenues? Because it seems like you've got a pretty reasonable amount
of confidence in the environment and your ability to drive revenue in this environment. So just curious if the inability to give guidance
is more driven by cost versus revenues?

David S. Marberger - Conagra Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
So Brian, let me hit the dividend. So Sean and I communicated in our remarks, our cash flow, our deleveraging cadence are ahead
of expectations, and we're confident we're going to hit the targeted 3.5 to 3.6x leverage ratio in the third quarter. We're also confident
in the long-term strength of the business as we reaffirm fiscal '22.

So based on this progress and the Board's confidence and the structurally higher earnings power for the company, the Board approved
a dividend from $0.85 to $1.10 annualized. And this increase moves us towards the longer-term historic payout ratio of 45% to 50%.
So that's what I'll tell you related to the dividend. Sean, anything for the second part on the long-term with the outlook?

Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Actually, more related to fiscal '21, just trying to understand not having guidance for the full year, is the lack of visibility more a
function of visibility on the top line? Or is it a function of cost?

Sean M. Connolly - Conagra Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. I think one of the things you got to keep in mind is we're -- we obviously are in the middle of a pandemic. So to some degree,
the upper control limit on revenue is how much can we get out of the plants. And the -- how much we get out of the plants is a
function of how healthy we can keep people.

So this is a very contagious disease. We're trying our best. We're doing a great job. But every day, when we come in, we start our day
at 8:00 in the morning going through a review of how healthy our people are in every single one of our facilities. And every day
brings us new information, and the team is doing a great job of managing that. But it's a variable, and it's a variable that makes it
very hard to predict how these quarters unfold, which is why we're taking this, at this point in time, quarter-by-quarter.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
All right. Well, maybe just to start at a high level here in terms of the evolution of complement-targeted therapies. Maybe I can turn it over to Cedric
first and then Grant second in terms of -- I guess, where have we been with complement-targeted therapies? And where are we today? Before we
get to where we're going.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. So complement has been pretty elusive for -- or was pretty elusive for a long time until in the last decade, kind of the first real therapeutics
started coming about. Actually, already in the 1970s and '80s, they tried to develop small-molecule serum protease inhibitors that had a lot of
toxicity issues at the time and weren't really pursued. Then in the 1990s, there were some biologicals that were tried that also were difficult, I mean,
large proteins to make. But then obviously, there was one little company, New Haven, that made an antibody that later became eculizumab.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And kind of really the first breakthrough in complements was in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. It's important to note that, that breakthrough
in PNH came on the heels of a lot of failures in the late 1990s, where the main focus of complement at the time was actually in this ischemia
reperfusion injury, and where a lot of money, unfortunately, went to waste on some large studies that failed.

But at Alexion at the time recovers really well from that. And the story in PNH, obviously, is a storied one with an inhibitor of complement factor
C5, and with an approach that involves an antibody where you really try to eliminate the final step before the membrane of that complex forms.

And then in the past 10 years, we've seen kind of a very exciting evolution. I mean, selfishly, I'd like to think about it in kind of 2 different directions.
One is in ophthalmology, where complements, we believe, and a lot of people now believe, is associated with the pathology behind age-related
macular degeneration. And then on the other hand, in diseases like PNH and several other diseases, where controlling the convertase activity is
something that we're all very excited about.

So I think we -- there's a lot more to come. And I think in the next 10 years, we're going to see some very exciting developments.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
And Grant, just to get your thoughts also in terms of like where we've been. But also looking at some of those other, kind of shifting from C5.
Obviously, you guys both are looking at C3, but some of the other things like C2, factor D, factor B, where have we seen some kind of past attempts
there to target those in the complements cascade.

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Sure. I mean, absolutely. I think that was a really great introduction, Cedric, given the evolution of eculizumab being the first one. And I remember
sitting in ASH when that was in Phase III, and everybody was really excited about that on getting to the market and being the first intervention in
PNH. It looked like it had a great traction of wording.

And true, the complement cascades, like the coagulation cascade, where we work as well. And these are ancient cascades and they're both protease
cascades and they kind of run in parallel with a lot of crosstalk. And there's been a lot of academic research on it over the years, starting back in
the '60s and '70s, but it didn't get a lot of traction as well. And so this is really starting to kind of all come together. And with the advent of the first
inhibitors of C5, people really started to look further at the cascades and where intervention makes sense.

And like I said, just like coagulation, they're waterfall cascades. So you kind of start a pie with activators and then they activate another convertase,
which activates down further the cascade. Complements then, multiple modes of entry into it, between the classical and the lactate and the
alternative pathways, they all converge at C3. And I think that's one of the advantages of targeting C3 as you kind of get it right where all these
pathways are converging. But you're still further up in the waterfall cascade than C5.

Some of the new targets, going after factor B and factor D or even further up in the cascades, as well as C2 and targets up the C1 on the classical
pathway, they offer opportunities where if you get the initiation of the cascade, you can perhaps get better efficacy, but you also have to have a
really good control up there as well because just a little bit of leakage, and you'll still have the cascades kind of moving on and amplifying down
the way.

So I think there's a lot of opportunities coming along. And along with crosstalk with inflammation and coagulation, I think you get kind of a C
complement playing a role in a lot more diseases as people look closer at this pathway.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. And then maybe throwing it back to Cedric, I mean, let's talk about C3 first. And again, why you, again, are focused on that one in terms of
the approach there. I mean, obviously, you guys are looking at a peptide approach. So you're trying to understand why you think that's advantageous.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And then obviously, we can talk about C2, factor D and factor B. But maybe just starting with that one because both of you guys have strong
knowledge base there.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. No, thank you, Derek. So look, I mean we -- I wish I had like a sophisticated answer for you. But we were young like you at the time, and we felt
like, hey, C3 sits in the middle. May as well shut it all down. But that's a good initial approach. And we in-licensed this class of molecules from the
University of Pennsylvania, I'm talking 2004 or '05. And then started working with those and started optimizing them and develop them in the
multiple indications where we are currently active.

But what we discovered over the years, which I think is really important, behind the mechanism of pegcetacoplan, and quite frankly, the other
molecules as well that we are using, is that even though we call them C3 inhibitors, they're not really C3 inhibitors, sticto sensu. And what I mean
by that is that pegcetacoplan binds to C3 in a pocket that is essential to C3b as well. And by doing that, you inhibit, on one hand, the formation or
the activation of C3 on the cell surface. But then once it's there and it forms convertases, both the C3 and the 2 C5 convertases, you control those
as well. And we see our maximum pharmacology actually when there's still 10%, sometimes 20%, of free floating C3 in circulation.

And the reason for that -- and I love Grant's analogy with the cascade, right? I mean, if you take, I think of it a little bit more like a river with the
cascade at the end, where when you try to inhibit C5, you stand at the bottom of the cascade and you try to catch all the water. And under normal
conditions, that can work very well, right. But when you have a rain storm and there's more water coming through, that can become a big problem.
And in diseases like PNH, we see that, right, where you can have these breakthrough hemolytic events because there is a rainstorm.

What we do is we go upstream on the river and we built not 1 but 3 sequential dams. And each dam is not a complete dam. It lets the water flow
through. But if you get 90% inhibition followed by 90% and followed by 90%, that's 99.9%, right? So that is a little bit conceptually what we try to
do with this mechanism. And where we believe kind of that favorable profile of safety versus efficacy can be found that we've observed.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Excellent. Grant, do you have anything to add on that?

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Yes. I mean, so I think it's a very good analogy for the mechanism going after C3 and kind of shutting it down. I like the idea that you get a big burst
of water, it's really hard to control and cover the bucket up at the end if you're going after C5, which is why you might see some failures with some
of the anti-C5s in a variety of different therapeutic areas and getting traction with the C3 inhibitors.

We take a very similar approach. It's a little different though, obviously. So we're targeting proteases. And of course, proteases, the advantage there
is that one protease can take out thousands of targets, if not more. So you can get a very good, extended pharmacodynamic aspect based upon
this very small amount of your therapeutic compound in place. And we can go in and then we take down and degrade all of the C3. So we end up
cleaving the C3 into 2 inactive fragments. And so you can't have any further functionation activity out of a C3a or a C3b, essentially. So it's a dead
protein and then it's unable to go on and do anything else.

And so it's a down-regulation too, again, making sure that C3 doesn't have to get activated and go where it needs to go by keeping that suppressed.
And then the one advantage with the proteases is that you can knock it down. And then as your PK comes down, you're able to have a long
pharmacodynamic effect like that. And that's really what we capture with these protease therapeutics, is this type of idea.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. I guess, what do you think the advantage of targeting C3 versus some of these new molecules coming out targeting factor D and factor B?
Some of these are orals. But I guess, what do you think are some of the advantages and maybe some of the challenges, you think, developing
therapeutics for those targets might be? Maybe start with Grant and we can go to Cedric after.

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Sure. So I mean, I think in principle, the higher you target up on the waterfall, you can be more efficacious. But I think you also have to be more
cognizant of your efficacy at that level, too. So if you have a really good regulator up higher around factor D or factor B, it could be efficacious
coming down. However, if you're not able to knock down all the activity and you get some leakage, these systems amplify as they go down. And
so you're not going to be as effective as coming in and, say, targeting at C3, where you can knock it all down.

So it really depends on, I think, the profile of the molecule in these different targets when you're going upstream into factor D and factor B. As well
as, I think, various of the therapy areas that are being targeted here, their etiology may be more tied to a specific dysfunctional aspect of the cascade.
And therefore, if you target your therapeutic towards the dysfunctional part of the cascade as opposed to like going after C5 at the end, you may
have a much more efficacious effect.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Great. And Cedric?

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. No, that was a great explanation. I think, look, I mean, first of all, these small molecules are really awesome medicinal efforts. I mean, it's very
difficult to control these serum proteases with small molecules, so it's worth commending the companies that are going after that.

As Grant explained, you get kind of an exclusive inhibition of the alternative pathway with the possibility for the classical pathway to become
activated and not be under control. That, in some conditions, may be okay, in other conditions, not so much, right? I mean, because when you
have, for example, an infection and antibodies become active in the system, you can have moments where your pharmacological control is not so
good. And if you take a disease like, for example, PNH, it is very important there that you continuously control that activity without kind of lapses
along the way. Otherwise, you get breakthrough hemolytic events which are dangerous for patients and something to keep a close eye on.

So if you think about PNH, where you are beholden to having to take your pill twice a day, and you can absolutely not forget to take it, right, or
bad things will happen to you. And in the meantime, we have to find out of, over the long run, you don't get these breakthrough hemolytic events
when there is an infection that happens somewhere. That makes it challenging.

But there are other indications, for example, in the kidney, where should it be efficacious, forgetting to take a pill is not such a big deal, probably,
right? And where -- I think efficacy-wise, it's -- in my opinion, and I'm sure Grant's as well, always going to be very hard to beat the efficacy of
targeting C3. But the convenience factor, of course, with a little bit less efficacy in certain conditions, could be beneficial and helpful to patients. I
think there's plenty to be done in the therapeutic world with complements, though.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
So I guess, I mean, is it fair to say in terms of like the oral approach, obviously, we're still -- that's still evolving and we're still seeing new data
generated. But I guess, because there's such an abundance of protein in some of these indications, I guess, the ability to like almost sop that up,
you may require pretty high dosing and pretty frequent dosing. Is that kind of the takeaway that we should kind of get from that kind of approach?
Maybe, Grant, you can take that.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Yes. I mean, I think, obviously, the Holy Grail always is thinking of an oral approach that's easy to take. And the more or less frequent you have to
do the oral approach and -- on a -- is more attractive. But again, that is, when you're working with these cascades and when you're working from
a large protein abundance, you need a lot of molecules to take that out. And by -- kind of by default with small molecules, they can be great. And
if you get them specific for their target, they're nice inhibitors. But you do need usually a lot more than 1:1 and maintain a steady level of this. So
depending upon the disease that Cedric was pointing at, if you miss a few doses here and there, you might still have inhibition, but at some point,
you could drop below that threshold and then kind of the waterfall starts running again.

And so those are some of the things that we think about with the small molecule inhibitor approach in the orals. But they are -- the ones out there
have shown some nice data so far, particularly vetting those as targets in some of these particular diseases as well.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. And I want to go back to a point you were talking about, Cedric, in terms of different indications and then maybe targeting different areas
of the complement cascade. I guess, again, you talked about GA, I mean are there -- and PNH, but are there other indications where this -- targeting
certain components may lead to better efficacy? I don't know if we're there yet with the data, but I'd love to kind of get both of your thoughts on
where we are in terms of understanding each of these indications at that level and where best to target.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Not that I'm aware of. And of course, I'm not biased at all. But it's -- I think that the place where I think there's some intriguing data that hasn't
translated clinically yet is at level of C5, where you can get C5a activation by proteases like thrombin, for example, but at high concentrations.

And again, generally speaking, these serum proteases tend to cross-react with each other. And as Grant alluded to earlier, the whole clotting
cascade is actually very similar, right? And [genetically] very similar to what you have in complement as well. So there's crosstalk between these 2
that's pathologically relevant. Whether that can -- you can take advantage of those points in terms of efficacy, right now, I cannot think of a single
place where that is the case compared to controlling convertase activity at the level of C3.

And then the other question, obviously, that always comes up is, well, okay, you want efficacy, it cannot be better, how about safety? I mean, is it
safe to control C3? I mean, look -- and it's hard to tell, of course, because we are still, relatively speaking, early.

But in a disease like PNH, where we control C3 systemically in the whole body chronically over time, we are now nearing probably about 160 to
170 patient years of dosing. That, if you think about that in the context of C5 inhibition, every 100 to 200 patient years, you will see an inflection
with meningococcus, so meningitis. We, cross fingers, haven't seen that yet. We've seen a very good profile on the safety side. And that, we believe,
may have something to do with the fact that we leave some C3 in circulation, right? So maybe when there's a bacteria that actually comes into the
body, there's still some C3 left to control that.

But it's too early to tell that. I mean, we'll find that out when we're at probably 500 patient years or more.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Yes. Grant, I don't know if you want to add to that.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Yes. I think those are really good points, Cedric. When you're -- you don't really want to shut it down completely. If you turn the basset off completely,
then you run the risk of these infections. And so having some C3 left is probably good, so that it's not completely shut down for a long duration of
time, but it has a little bit of activity going on.

And then with regards to kind of targeting other parts of the cascade and thinking of safety. If you've got a disease that's related to autoantibodies
that are running through the classical pathway, it could be much more attractive to only work on the classical pathway side versus the alternative
pathway side. So you leave the alternative pathway open to signal through C3 if you have interrogation there that the body needs for protection.

So there's a couple of ways of looking at it from the safety aspect. One, making sure you don't shut off the faucet completely; and two, kind of more
specific targeting, if it's possible to go that way with your therapeutic diseases.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. I guess we're going to have a bunch of panels today. And I think one of the underlying things that I've seen in, at least in immunology, is
that you can find kind of similar biology and derisk that pretty quickly and kind of have this ""pipeline in a product"".

So I mean, maybe Cedric, do you see that with pegcetacoplan? I mean, you have 2 indications, but 2 different routes of administration. But where
else do you kind of see that going? And I guess, from your standpoint, based on some of the things that we talked about, different types of crosstalk
between the complement cascade and things like that, is that -- does it make it very challenging to really hone in and identify pretty derisked
indications?

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. So the answer is absolutely yes, right? I mean, we've spoken about that publicly to some extent, not a lot yet. We have a proof-of-concept in
C3 glomerulopathy and I think cold agglutinin disease. We are -- what we have done in the past couple of months is kind of really think strategically
through the next couple of years. I mean, what can we do with the subcutaneous form of pegcetacoplan in a range of other indications? How do
you stagger those over time? How do you make sure that they're truly giving a benefit to patients and not create a me-too situation. I'd like to think
that what we did in PNH was not just create a drug for PNH, but a drug that truly gives the benefit to patients over and above what C5 could do.

Generally, we think about the world in those terms. And then to your point, you get to choose between indications where the control of complements
has a solid, robust proof-of-concept behind it, generally with C5, obviously, because of Soliris being there. An example could be myasthenia gravis,
for example. If you control myasthenia gravis at the level of C3, very likely, you will also find an efficacy profile there. The question is, will it be better
or not? That we could hold the answer to.

So -- and then there are new indications. I mean, there's a laundry list, right, of diseases where complement is very likely involved. We think that
neurodegeneration is a very exciting place, specifically for C3. And controlling C3 in neurology is something that we are very interested in, and
that we'll see where that goes as well.

So answer is yes, absolutely, a platform. More to follow in the months to come, but we intend to deploy that.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Yes. And Grant, just turning over to you. You guys have your kind of platform that you're working on. But how are kind of thinking about indication
selection? And I know you're partnered with Biogen on geographic atrophy. So just kind of thinking about, longer term, where do you think you
will look in terms of indication selection.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Yes. Great. Yes. So it's -- for us, the strategy is thinking about our platform being protease engineering. And these are protease cascades, so really,
the natural way to think of a way to intervene there is to engineer proteases to play in specific niches of the cascade and where it makes sense.

As you pointed out, Biogen, 2782 PEG is partnering with Biogen for dry AMD in ophthalmology. It's a great molecule for that. We showed some
really nice data at ARGO in 2019. And the collaboration is going well with Biogen there. So we're excited to see that molecule moving forward.

With our own strategic pipeline we have going, we're thinking about where we can best intervene in the cascades, and perhaps modulate one
niche or the other along the pathway using proteases. And I think this kind of goes back to some of the discussion we had a little earlier about
different parts of the cascade maybe much more relevant to target for different diseases and therapeutic areas.

So as we do our therapeutic area selection of those that are an interest for us, those -- again, if they're validated and derisked by other programs
going on that's -- those are attractive targets. As well as there's a lot of other new ones that are just coming up in the literature as people investigate
more about complement and its roles. We look to find what part of the cascade would be the best area to target. And then, then, we work on
engineering our proteases to work in those areas.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Excellent. And obviously, this is a very topical sort of question. But I guess, Cedric, in terms of COVID and where you think maybe the complement
cascade plays a role in COVID-19 related arts, maybe just talk to us about the rationale here. I know you guys have a trial. And I'd love to get Grant's
take on this, too. But maybe just walk us through kind of the biology and your thoughts in terms of the MOA.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. No. Thank you, Derek. So we believe that complement plays a very important role in the thrombotic microangiopathy that seems to be very
important in this disease, right? So when you go back to January, February and March, at the time, we thought about COVID-19 as a disease of
ARDS, right? Acute respiratory distress syndrome. And it turned out, and that was the whole story around ventilators, of course, for those on the
panel -- or on the screen here that haven't followed that. The story around the ventilators was very much focused on that. And as it turns out now,
ventilators are far less important. As a matter of fact, probably hurt the lungs in many circumstances more than anything else, than conversely,
making sure that you control the inflammation, specifically the underlying thrombotic microangiopathy that happens.

When you think about patients with COVID-19 that come into the emergency room, what's most striking there is they come in often feeling a little
long-winded, not feeling good. And then they put on a pulse ox and they have a saturation of 60 or 70. And that's kind of a big disconnect. And
that is much less like ARDS and much more like pulmonary embolism.

When you have a young woman on the pill who smokes and who comes into your emergency room, very similar to that, your immediate thoughts
should go to a deep venous thrombosis that is shooting little emboli into the lungs. And what happens when you have these small micro -- small
clots, tiny clots in the capillary of the lungs, is you start having perfusion ventilation differences that start occurring in the lung. And I would bet a
lot of money that if you were to do a wedge-pressure analysis of the arterial blood pressure, which is complicated and invasive, which is why it
doesn't happen, that probably most of these patients have severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

And I mentioned all of that because controlling these blood clots is actually, we believe, very important, and we believe, driven by complement.
So you asked how does that happen? And I'm sorry, Grant, I'm taking a little bit -- a lot of time here, but I think it's important. The reason why we
think this happens is that virus is going to circulation and are immediately opsonized by complement factor C3.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And there's a little thing about complement biology that most people tend to forget, and that is that when C3 binds to cell surface, it binds covalently.
Once it's there, it's there forever. It doesn't go anywhere anymore. And the purpose of that is that now this viral particle becomes engulfed with
C3 product. And that's a good thing because most of its cells will see that and actually phagocyte those and eat these particles.

In the case of COVID-19, that actually -- that precise mechanism becomes a little bit of a liability. Because what you get on the surface of these viral
particles is not inactive C3 products or degraded C3 products. These are active, preformed convertases. And when these cells actually bind to the
cells that happen to be around, they deliver not just their payloads, but also a piece of membrane that is covered in these preactivated convertases.
And when that happens on a cell's surface, on our own cells now, right, in the lungs, in the blood vessels, the endothelial cells, you start getting
massive activation on these cell surfaces.

And we have our own defense against that, right? We inactivate complement on our own surfaces. And we have the last line of defense called
CD59 to prevent the formation of the membrane attack complex so the cells don't exclude. These defenses are limited in terms of what they can
do. You can run out of these differences. And that's what we believe is happening in these patients, is that at the level of the platelets, you will start
seeing activation on the platelets that leads to these thrombotic microangiopathies, but also at the level of the endothelial cells, where over-activation
of complement on these cell surfaces puts stress on them, leads ultimately to endothelial dysfunction and contributes to the pathology.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. I don't know, Grant, if you want to add anything to that.

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
I think that was a really great explanation and giving kind of the etiology of how complement can play in -- with COVID-19 and the viral infection
and how it hijacks the body. I think that was a great explanation.

I would just add, again, with kind of thinking of the endothelium you're targeting, that's where you got a lot of triggers for your coagulation. You
get von Willebrand factor binding. You have a big crossover between complement and how von Willebrand factor is working, and this leads to
platelet aggregation and you get a lot of these thrombotic microangiopathies coming out of that. So it is, yes, it's kind of a snowball effect going
down, and then eventual organ damage.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. Okay. Well, I want to shift gears just to kind of get some of the company-specific questions in terms of both of your stories and kind of the
updates here.

So maybe just starting with Cedric. You guys just submitted your NDA for pegcetacoplan in PNH. I kind of wanted to just get your thoughts on
potential labeling scenarios for that indication for pegcetacoplan.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes, yes. NDA submissions are a lot of work. It takes more than a couple of days. There was a special exercise to go through. We're not commenting
on labeling yet. What I will kind of point out here is that we ran the PEGASUS study with a big chip on our shoulder, right? I mean, at the end of the
day, you have to remember that in PNH, patients suffer from a life-threatening disease. And when they take C5 inhibitor like Soliris to Ultomiris,
they're taking a life-saving drug.

Now as it turns out, when you block at the level of C5, you do nothing about the fact that red blood cells in these patients get coated with C3
covalently, as we were talking about with COVID as well, right? And that essentially makes the survival span of these red blood cells much shorter

                                                                                                                                                                             
 than they're supposed to. I mean, red blood cells are supposed to live 3 to 4 months. But if you cover them in C3, they will get removed in the liver
and the spleen by monocytic cells. So that is reflected in the PNH population in a significant unmet need in terms of severe anemia, in terms of --
it is severe transfusion dependency. But you cannot measure this process of C3 covering and removal in the liver. So that was really hypothetical.
And a lot of people were skeptical that you could do anything about the anemia and transfusion dependency in these patients.

So I mentioned that because when we ran our Phase III clinical trial, we did it in a way where we thought it was very important to make it comfortable
for patients and physicians to switch over to a product that would make them better, but cognizant of the fact that they have a life-threatening
disease and are taking a life-saving drug in the form of Soliris.

So what did we kind of envision when we did this trial? We said we're going to take 1 month in which we don't ask a patient to discontinue their
C5 inhibitor and we're going to layer our drug on top of that C5 inhibitor. Not just in the active group, also in the control group. And then after 1
month in the control group, we're going to remove pegcetacoplan again and they're going to go back to where they were before.

And obviously, that was highly unpleasant to do because the efficacy difference was, quite frankly, beyond what we even thought would happen.
But what we have now is you can tell a patient it is safe for you to try pegcetacoplan for a few weeks. And if it doesn't do it for you, within a few
weeks, you're back to where you were before. And you can do that safely.

After that, we had a 4-month monotherapy phase, in which each patients were on pegcetacoplan alone or Soliris alone. And so from the labeling
perspective, we believe that we have established efficacy for the monotherapy period as well, even though it went through a switchover phase.

So that's a long answer to your question. We hope to have a broad label, but we're not commenting or guiding on anything yet.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. Okay. And in terms of like if you were to get maybe second line, would this be like second line to a C5 class? Or would it be just to Soliris
because there were no patients, right, on Ultomiris in your study because it wasn't approved yet, I don't believe.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Well, when you look at the efficacy profile of Soliris versus Ultomiris, right, it's a pharmacodynamic play, right, at the end of the day. But it is the
exact same target with the exact same problems in patients as you do with Soliris. So we believe that this is a class improvement, not a drug
improvement. And hopefully, that will be reflected in our label.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
And the other thing was in terms of like kind of the commercial aspect of this, how much of advantage do you think there is with subcu infusion
delivery versus kind of IV? And we've seen with Alexion, obviously the Ultomiris approval, but also the fact that they're trying to shorten the infusion
time. They may go subcu also. So just kind of your thoughts, longer term, in terms of the competitiveness around that route of administration.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. There is -- in terms of the convenience of these things, there is not really a black or white, right? There's a lot of gray. I mean, for us on the call
here and probably most people listening, we're very active. I'm not particularly excited about spending 1 day every 2 months. Because it takes a
full day. You have to travel to the clinic. It's a long intravenous infusion with Ultomiris, right? I mean -- and I'm not talking about Soliris, which is
every 2 weeks. But taking Ultomiris where every 8 weeks, you have to go into a clinic and have a 3 hour-long infusion. And between checking in,
getting that, going out, it's a full day that you lose. For me, that is not very attractive.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 If you have a convenient and easy twice-a-week subcutaneous infusion that takes 30 minutes and that you can do at home, I would prefer that.
But if you have older people that want to see their physician every 2 months, assuming that, yes, efficacy were to be the same because that, at the
end of the day, in our opinion, trumps everything, right?

But just purely focused on the convenience, some people may prefer to get an intravenous and seeing their doctor. Other people may prefer to
have an oral product in spite of the liabilities of forgetting to take a pill.

So I don't think there's a black or white. At the end of the day, what matters in -- particularly in PNH, we believe, is the efficacy profile.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Yes. And can you just remind us in terms of the device you guys use for the subcu infusion? Like how long is the infusion? I think it's twice weekly,
if I recall the dosing regimen. But maybe just provide a little bit more detail on that.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes, correct. It's twice a week subcutaneous. Right now, the way -- I'll just graphically quickly explain it because it will make it clear to you. You have
a vial in the fridge, knowing that you can travel with it at room temperature, and it will -- that won't be in the initial label, but that will come. We
have the stability for that.

When you take it out of the fridge, you have to take it out with an 18-gauge extraction needle from the vial. You're going to remove the 18 gauge
needle, put on a butterfly. You stick the syringe in kind of a spring that pushes on the plunger and you put the butterfly under your skin. You can
walk around with this. It takes about 30 minutes to do.

We also have an in-house -- or I should say a collaboration where we are developing a device where the experience becomes needle-less. There's
no more manipulation of any needles at all. You take the vial, you stick it in a receptacle, it sucks the liquid automatically into a disc. You place that
disc on your abdomen, it sticks to it. You click on a button, 4-millimeter 30-gauge needle goes under the skin and delivers the product over 30
minutes.

So that will come on the market about 1.5 years after our initial launch and we believe will be a great improvement for these patients as well.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
And then just one last question before we go to geographic atrophy. But obviously, we've seen the data from LNP-023. We saw some data from
the BioCryst folks yesterday for some oral complement inhibitors. So just kind of your thoughts on -- I mean, you alluded to this a little bit earlier
in the discussion, but just kind of your thoughts on kind of the oral competition coming into the PNH market. Again, how that might impact
pegcetacoplan.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. I think, look, again, in PNH, efficacy is the single most important thing in that disease. So I think in PNH, it's going to depend in the long run
how these oral products perform on an efficacy basis.

I also think it will depend a little bit on the personalities of people. If you have to take a pill twice a day and forgetting to take a pill could have bad
consequences, again, from my personal viewpoint, I would prefer twice a week subcutaneous, which even that I can forget and know that for 3 or
4 days, nothing bad is going to happen to me.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So I think it kind of -- but having said that, the BioCryst data also look beautiful and the LNP-023 as well. These are -- look like great molecules. I
mean, they are serum protease inhibitors. So in the long run, again, we'll have to make sure that they're safe to use and also cross reactivities. But
it will be great in the armamentarium for not just PNH patients, but patients generally with all these conditions, to have an oral product available.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. Okay. And then just a couple on geographic atrophy before going back to Grant. But I guess, maybe just give us an update on the recruitment
for your 2 studies there.

And then as you think about the bar for efficacy in geographic atrophy, obviously, there's nothing approved there. But what do you think that
efficacy bar is right now for that indication?

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. So we -- so to your first question, the study was fully enrolled by early July, and we will have a readout in Q3 of next year. Very, very, very
important studies for us, obviously considering the investment that we're making. I think also for the field because it's -- there have been so many
failures in geographic atrophy that it's important that we get it across the finish line.

Sorry, the second piece of your question was what again, Derek?

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
What do you think the efficacy bar is there? I mean, obviously, we know there's nothing approved. But like what do you think would be very clinically
meaningful in that population?

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Yes. So we actually have -- are doing a lot of research on that to kind of understand and prepare for our commercialization. Depending on which
physician you ask, they will tell you 20% to 30%. It's generally in that range in terms of reduction over the course of 1 year, which ironically is exactly
what we saw with monthly and every other month in our Phase II clinical trial.

What was intriguing in our Phase II clinical trial is that from month 6 to month 12, there was a clear trend for an increased effect size from month
6 to month 12. And that's something that we'll have to see if that continues to ""improve"" when you continue to dose into the second year. That's
something very exciting for us. The Phase III, even though it reads out at 1 year, will have continued randomized and will read out again at 2 years.
And we'll see if there's a further improvement in these patients.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. All right. Well, let's shift to Grant and the kind of what they're doing at Catalyst Bio. Maybe you talked a little bit about your platform. And
maybe you could just give us some of the details around the way you're approaching complement inhibition. And again, I think your program is
pretty early, but any sort of data you can share thus far that you've generated, preclinically or clinically, that would be helpful.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Yes, yes. So excellent. So yes, so the protease platform has protease engineering, and you can think of it as kind of 2 pillars. So in one sense, we're
optimizing natural proteases, and this kind of leads into what we have for our compounds in hemophilia for hemophilia B and also for -- and with
inhibitors with marzeptacog, alpha-activated. These are optimized, engineered versions of the natural proteases.

And then on the other pillar, you have taking a protease scaffold and then engineering it to do something new. And this is what we did with
2782-PEG. And this is a protease scaffold and it's been engineered to specifically cleave C3, as I said before, at a part that makes the fragments kind
of inactive and can't move on any further. And we do this through a molecular evolution platform.

So we've got kind of the 2 pillars and sometimes kind of programs going forward, a complement will then be a fusion of the 2 types of programs,
taking molecular evolution approaches as well as optimizing proteases that are already there in the cascade. These are ways we can think of right
now how we would go forward with these programs.

The preclinical data on 2782, like I said, we showed at ARGO, which was really exciting. In a 28-day study, we were able to knock down and suppressed
C3 for 28 days with no C3. We can take this initial study, and we can model the affected PDs that we might get in humans. And so if you recall, with
proteases, you have the advantage that even though your PK is going down and you may have lost your compound by up to 3 logs, we still had
C3 suppressed in this preclinical model. And then -- so you have this really extended-duration PD effect after your PK has gone away. And that's
really harnessing this power of proteases that we talked about.

And then when we modeled this to the human condition, so you can take your preclinical models and you can do [measured] scaling and you can
take what your suspected dosing is going to be in humans, in this case, we feel that we will be able to dose every 3 or 4 months and be able to
keep that C3 level below 90% target levels, so that 90% of the C3 has been knocked down. And then this correlates pretty well with the expectations
that Cedric's team has shown with how much C3 suppression you need to get really good, beneficial effects in geographic atrophy.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. I guess, as you think about kind of indication expansion, and you talked about this a little bit earlier, but is there any kind of safety risk
associated with your approach when you go systemic? Would you be looking at systemic? Or does it kind of limit you to only really local type of
delivery?

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
No, no. I mean, what we're looking to do is go into the systemic area. So we see subcutaneous systemic complement inhibitors is kind of where
our future is and moving into other indications. And it's a matter of -- as I already mentioned before, you want it -- you would tailor the protease
weighing that specificity and safety profile. And so that's what we have in the power, in kind of behind our engineering platform, is to do that. And
make sure that anything comes out is going to be -- have a very low risk of safety profile and tolerability.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. Okay. And then I think you guys have an event coming up where you're going to highlight some of the complement stuff you're working
on. I don't know if you want to just, yes -- real quick. Then we have...

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
So we haven't talked much about our complement program other than the partnered one with Biogen. We have a lead molecule we've shown just
a little bit of data on for extended half-life showing that we can go once-weekly subcutaneous with this molecule. There will be much more of a
                                                                                                                                                                             
 reveal coming out in the end of the year. In December, we'll have a KOL Research Day where we'll talk more about our lead molecule and as well
as what else we'll be doing in the complement field.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Excellent. So yes, I want to just tackle a question or 2 we got from some listeners.

So one being -- and I think this is directed towards Cedric on that COVID explanation. On that epitheliopathy explanation for COVID morbidity
sounds a lot like aHUS. How come we don't see signs of hemolysis or hemoglobinuria, anemia, et cetera? Any thoughts on that question?

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Well, we do see LDH increases, right, in COVID-19. The amount of -- and there is probably some hemolysis going on, but you have to remember
that the red blood cells in normal -- most normal individuals are not like the red blood cells in PNH or in aHUS, where there's actually complement
disregulation that is happening on a genetic basis. So I think the main component there is that your CD59 sits on the cell surface and blocks the
formation of the membrane attack complex. So to truly see intravascular hemolysis to the extent that you do in PNH, you won't have.

In aHUS, you have more hemolysis. It's better contained as well. You do have CD59 in that case. But in aHUS, the damage in the kidney that you
see is subsequent, obviously, to these [histo cells] going around and the thrombosis associated with that. But I think that, in my opinion, there is
some hemolysis going on, and there is clearly kidney targeting as well that happens in COVID-19.

Derek Christian Archila - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
Got it. Okay. Well, guys, thank you so much for the discussion. Grant and Cedric, again, thanks we're kicking off the event this morning, and look
forward to catching up soon. But I think we'll leave this panel here. So thanks again, gentlemen.

Cedric Francois - Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Co-Founder, President, CEO & Director
Thank you so much. Take care.

Grant Blouse - Catalyst Biosciences, Inc. - SVP of Translational Research
Thank you very much, Derek. Appreciate it. Goodbye.

Thank you very much, operator, and I apologize in advance if I lose my place. I was having little printer issues, so I was unable to print the speech
beforehand.

Welcome to IDT's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call covering results for the 3 and 12 months ended July 31, 2020. I'm joined
today on the call by Marcelo Fischer, IDT's Chief Financial Officer. For a more detailed report on our financial and operational results, please read
our earnings release filed earlier today and our Form 10-K, which we expect to file with the SEC on October 14.

First off, I want to thank our teams worldwide who continue to do just a terrific job despite the challenges of working from home as I can attest. In
particular, I want to thank all our colleagues, distributors and retail partners who continue to support our customers under these very difficult
circumstances.

One thing I don't talk enough about is our customers. I want to take a moment to thank them for trusting us in this challenging time. Our business
customers count on us every day to allow them to manage their businesses better, both online and offline, to collaborate with their suppliers and
to communicate with their partners and clients. Our BOSS Revolution customers count on us to keep in touch with their family and friends and
deliver their very hard-earned money to loved ones worldwide.

Our business is all about earning the trust that our customers place in us every day. We don't take that responsibility lightly, and we work hard
every day to make sure that we continue to improve. As a small token of appreciation for all that our customers do, we developed and underwrote
a project called Stories of the American Dream. The project is a collection of stories told by people from all over the world who came to America
                                                                                                                                                                             
 and are making truly remarkable contributions to our country. You can see this wonderful project by visiting storiesoftheamericandream.com or
by following us on social media.

Our fourth quarter results were quite good. We achieved our highest levels of consolidated quarterly margin contribution and adjusted EBITDA in
over a decade.

Let's start by talking about our exciting growth businesses and their achievements. Money Transfer's fourth quarter revenue increased by $14.3
million year-over-year and $9.5 million sequentially to $21.3 million. Full fiscal year 2020 Money Transfer revenue was $48 million, more than double
the $23.1 million generated in fiscal 2019.

Our Money Transfer business built upon its strong organic growth by leveraging certain favorable foreign exchange market conditions to deliver
exceptional results this quarter. These forex conditions are transient, however, and they began to normalize following the quarter close.

Although our digital channels, again, were the main contributor to Money Transfer's rapid growth, our complementary in-store Money Transfer
channel also has huge potential.

Over the past several quarters, we have dramatically improved our platform and stabilized in-store transaction levels and margin contributions.
We now believe we are in a position to grow our retail footprint.

Before this calendar year is out, we expect to build on the success of our BR Money app by launching a synergistic neobank offering. Our BOSS
Money neobank, also called Money, will have numerous unique features. It will also be monthly fee-free and virtually fee-free in general and provide
robust consumer rewards to drive rapid customer acquisition. As we extend the capabilities of the BR Money app, we are going to expand its reach
beyond the U.S.A., and we are developing quite a few additional exciting fintech products and offerings that will appeal to consumers globally.

Continuing with our growth businesses, net2phone's product and development teams were very busy this quarter. We introduced our Microsoft
Teams integration and late in the third -- excuse me, we introduced our Microsoft Teams integration late in the third quarter. And this quarter, we
already added over 3,000 people to it.

This quarter, we also released Huddle, our video conferencing solution worldwide. Huddle is also getting very good traction with our customers,
and I personally use it almost every day. In addition, net2phone's rolled out new billing platforms in the U.S. and will deploy those billing platforms
worldwide over the course of the next year.

Earlier this week, we officially released net2phone Zoho integration, and we will soon announce a ton of other CRM integrations and some major
feature enhancements. We also are getting good traction on our net2phone APIs, facilitating custom integration by developers with third-party
solutions.

The increasing sophistication of our cloud communication offerings and strong demand helped to increase UCaaS subscription revenue here in
the U.S. by 12% sequentially and 43% compared to the year ago quarter.

In South America, the stronger dollar and COVID-19 impact had the opposite effect, lowering our dollar-denominated revenues, elevating customer
churn and slowing sales. However, we are seeing a big improvement in the current quarter, and I'm personally optimistic that we will return to
sustained growth in our international markets in fiscal 2021.

At National Retail Solutions, revenue increased by $2.8 million year-over-year to $4.7 million. Full fiscal year revenue hit $12 million, nearly double
the $6.2 million generated in fiscal 2019.

We continue to add tons of new features to the POS, and we continued improving our NRS retailer app, and we massively improved the BR Club
app during the quarter, helping us achieve record app usage and app purchases for our store owners. The app lets customers order and pay
                                                                                                                                                                             
 remotely, and we also launched our loyalty program inside the BR Club app. I am personally excited to start using the rewards in my local coffee
shop. I love earning that free coffee.

Merchant services, including credit card processing services for retailers and the sale of digital advertising through our POS terminal network were
the fastest-growing revenue sources at NRS. Unlike most payment processing services, NRS Pay does not require a contract. We also provide our
equipment without charge, and there are no hidden fees. We charge only flat transparent rates. And as a result, we're enrolling new retailers faster
than ever.

For advertisers, our POS network offers an extremely cost-effective way to reach the large and ethnically diverse urban population served by our
retailers. Our customers facing digital -- our customer-facing digital screens handle both still and video ads that display while our retailers are
ringing up the purchases. We already process over 46 million transactions per month, and that number is growing rapidly.

Currently, we are selling only a small percentage of our POS network's ad space capacity. But as programmatic buying becomes a bigger driver of
digital out-of-home advertising, as we expect it will, that percentage will increase substantially. Because advertisers have seen that our displays
result in high levels of customer engagement and because the high gross margins associated with advertising sales in general, we believe that the
NRS ad network represents a very long-term growth opportunity.

The expansion of our POS network has been exceptional. NRS added over 1,200 terminals during the quarter. And by the quarter's close, we were
billing for 11,500 units. And now with Yankee Hall of Famer, Mariano Rivera, pitching for National Retail Solutions as NRS' spokesperson, we are
positioned to knock the ball out of the park in 2021. I've always wanted to say that.

Now let's pivot and very briefly review results for IDT Telecom's core offerings. BOSS Revolution's Calling and Mobile Top-up had strong performances
in the fourth quarter as our customers kept in closer touch with and increased their support for friends and families during the pandemic. Our
wholesale carrier division, which depends on international businesses' communications was again impacted by the closure or partial closure of
many corporate offices due to the pandemic.

From a balance sheet perspective, we continued to strengthen our position during the fourth quarter. We increased our holdings of cash, debt
securities and equity investments by $38.7 million to $109.2 million, even as we returned $4 million to our stockholders through repurchases of
our common stock. We accomplished this while remaining free of debt.

Wrapping up, I again want to thank our amazing IDT net2phone, NRS and BOSS teammates who continue their amazing product development,
sales and service during really tough and obviously unprecedented times. Thank you very much.

Now it's on to fiscal 2021. The continued expansion of our higher-margin growth businesses and the resilience of our consumer core offerings
position IDT to deliver improving results and to create significant long-term value. I'm very excited about the opportunities ahead, and I look
forward to reporting to you on our progress.

Marcel and I would be happy to take questions now, and I apologize for being choppy.

PRESENTATION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to PepsiCo's Third Quarter Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. (Operator Instructions) Today's call is being
recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.

It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Ravi Pamnani, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pamnani, you may begin.

Ravi Pamnani - PepsiCo, Inc. - SVP of IR
Thank you, operator. I hope everyone has had a chance this morning to review our press release and prepared comments, both of which are
available on our website.

Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We may make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our
business plans, 2020 outlook and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently involve
risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, and we are under no obligation to update.

When discussing our results, we may refer to non-GAAP measures which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today's earnings
release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our
results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.

Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta; and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 (Operator Instructions) And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
Hi. Can you hear me?

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
We can.

Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
Okay, great. So with the better-than-expected results here in Q3 and for full year earnings guidance, we're likely to end up with a pretty solid 2020
earnings result, all things considered, post-COVID. So I know you won't guide explicitly for next year, but just trying to understand at a high level,
do you view 2020 as a depressed earnings result and sort of a depressed earnings base that we should see outsized growth off of as we look out
to 2021, particularly as COVID costs drop off? Or is your bias more to reinvest any assumed drop-off in COVID cost?

And perhaps you can just discuss some of the key puts and takes potentially looking out to 2021 relative to what's obviously an abnormal 2020?

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Okay, Dara. Yes. Listen, we're very happy with the quarter and how our investments are starting to deliver in terms of, I would say, a global market
share improvement and sustained top line acceleration, and also how some of that is flowing down to the bottom of the P&L, as you saw in our
EPS numbers.

In terms of your question of are we going to keep investing or not? I think you know our philosophy. We've been trying to have sustainable growth
for the business, top line, bottom line, very balanced in that respect. I think there are continuous reinvestments required in terms of brands pivoting
into new spaces or new capabilities required because of the new ways consumers are shopping, especially around the omni-channel transformation.
There are sustainability reinvestments required.

So we're going to continue to run the business in a very balanced way, right? Where we're going to flow to the bottom line along the lines of what
we said a couple of years ago when we defined our high single-digit ambition for EPS long term. And -- but makes sure that we don't sacrifice the
reinvestments that are required for a company of our scale to remain competitive long term, given what's going on externally.

So that's how we're thinking about the business. Obviously, we'll give you more information in February. We'll know more about how the pandemic
evolves, the costs that will still be required to run the business. I would not be assuming at this point that the pandemic cost will go away by next
year. I think we'll continue to have to put some costs back into the business to run the business safely.

So more in February, but I just wanted you to get the philosophy, how we're thinking about the long-term reinvestment in the business and the
delivery of our EPS on a yearly basis.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
I hope all is well. So you spoke on the resilience of the business in developed markets and the recovery in beverages, in particular in North America
and also in Europe. So I was hoping if you can elaborate more, Ramon, on the trends for the on-premises with the reopening. And how are you
planning your price points in places in emerging markets where the recession may be hitting more, the consumer?

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, Andrea. Good. Yes, listen -- yes, I can give you a bit more color on the away-from-home business. It has rebounded from the very lows of April,
May, right? It's better. There's more mobility. There's more traffic in some channels. I would say there's a lot of innovation in a lot of the customers.
So they're adapting to the new reality. Especially, restaurants and some entrepreneurs are finding ways to adjust. But still is a very big drag in our
business, I would say in the levels of 30% to 40% versus year ago, negative, still in most of the developed markets.

So still a very negative. It's better than the minus 60s, 70s that we had in the April, May. But I'm sure it's going to be improving, right? We see some
channels still hurting a lot, like hospitality or entertainment or transportation. Those are still very low. We see some other channels improving, and
we're obviously going to lean into those channels to capture most of the growth. So that's the first part.

On the second part, Andrea, the -- yes, we see developing markets, especially, I would say, Latin America, parts of Africa, Middle East, starting to
feel the economic challenges for a lot of the households. So people are starting to -- there's a bit more unemployment, and there's obviously these
possible income challenges for many families. We tend to do well in those circumstances. We can adjust our price points quite fast, and we have
good playbooks on how to play in recessions, how to adjust entry points to the category, how to deliver good value on some of the family sizes
that are now preferred as well.

So I think we're going to do okay. We tend to do okay in these situations. But yes, there is, I would say Latin America and Africa, Middle East, signs
of economic challenges for many households.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Lee Herzog - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I had a question on your FY '20 guidance, which implies that organic sales growth should, I guess, modestly accelerate to, I think, around 5% in Q4
versus the 4.2% you reported in Q3. But then when I think about your full year EPS guidance, that implies EPS growth in the fourth quarter will
moderate a fair amount to around -- or from the 9% that you're reporting Q3 to around 3%. So I just really wanted to understand how conservative
your guidance might be, especially as I think about you facing maybe even fewer COVID-related headwinds as you round out the year.

And then maybe you guys could touch on what that assumes for A&M spending in Q4. I guess it could assume a pretty big step-up and maybe put
pressure on your margins, but drive an acceleration on your top line. So any color there would be helpful.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Hugh, you want to cover this one?

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes, happy to. A couple of things. Maybe you and Ravi can talk a little bit. My math is a little different on the top line for Q4. I think it lands somewhere
in the mid-4s based on the implied full year backing into Q4.

And in terms of the margin implications, probably the biggest factor in all of it will continue to be the COVID cost. We mentioned that we had about
$150 million worth of COVID cost in Q3, and that will continue to some degree in Q4 as well. And it's a bit of a longer quarter in that regard.

In addition to that, you know that our A&M spend is booked on a curve. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the curve will be affected by the full
year A&M spend. So I think it's a bit more of a drag in Q4 than it was in Q3. So nothing beyond those things, nothing in terms of other big, notable
costs, other than higher A&M and COVID costs that will continue based on what you've seen so far.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Wanted to ask a question about PBNA and good sequential improvement in the third quarter. And I guess, Ramon, what I'd like to understand now
is, now that you've got an energy drink -- a more comprehensive energy drink portfolio, can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the things
you're going to do to potentially, I guess, take advantage of this situation? You've got a largely company-owned bottling system. You've got the
resources to spend. So are there opportunities to begin to accelerate market share from here?

And then maybe if you could just touch on, in the third quarter specifically, were there any market share issues or any issues with out of stocks
relative to maybe can shortages or packaging?

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, good question. Listen, when we talked about PBNA about a year ago, we said we're going to try to go 1 step at a time trying to fix all the
different opportunities we had with the different brands, right? And the truth is that Q3 is a good reflection of that effort that the team has done
over the last year, 1.5 years. If you look at every one of our large brands, is accelerating. So Pepsi is growing; Mountain Dew, good growth; Gatorade,
good -- very good growth, I would say; our coffees, our teas, our juices are growing double digit. So very good performance across.

We've then -- with regards to the energy integration, as you can imagine, there's a lot of small details, right, in -- operational details in integrating
a business like Bang, which is quite sizable, and trying to move it from a very dispersed distribution setup to a more consolidated one. So in every
state, we have different anecdotes, and also the ROCKSTAR integration. So I think the team has done very good job in terms of both the integration.
Now we're starting to run it as a full business.

So to your question on the future, I think we're going to continue to double down on what I think has driven the success, which is very good
innovation, right? So if you think about all our Zero innovation, it's doing very well. Gatorade Zero, massive innovation; Mountain Dew Zero is doing
very well and starting to bring new consumers into the franchise, younger consumers that we had not been very successful with, so we feel good
about that. Pepsi Zero growing very nicely. Then obviously bubly continues to do very well.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So we'll continue to double down on innovation as a lever. We'll continue to double down on execution and becoming a better operating company.
So I think the changes we've made to our organization to more of a division structure is giving us more granularity and more local excellence, if
you wish, in terms of execution. We're going to double down on that.

The energy portfolio gives us much more scale in the convenience channel, which was a -- some sort of a weakness for us. And so we're improving
in that channel. If you see the market share in convenience stores in the summer, great progress. So we're happy with how we're doing in that
respect. So we'll continue with the playbook. It's working for us. Now we have 1 more set of tools in our arsenal with this energy portfolio.

We're happy with the way Gatorade is working. We're seeing a lot of more people exercising. It's a good trend. We like it, that people are exercising
at home. People are embracing daily routines of exercising. That helps the sports drink category and obviously Gatorade as a leader in that category.

So we see a lot of positives for growth in the portfolio. And then we're happy with Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew Zero has been a great addition
to the team. And it's -- I mean, it's getting scale and it's getting very good trial, very good repeats and is very incremental to the brand.

So I think you will see, I think, that sustained performance in PBNA. And hopefully, we can yet improve our market competitiveness as we go along.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.

Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages & Lead Consumer Staples
Analyst
I just had a quick clarification question, and then my real question. Ramon, I was hoping you could just clarify your comments around the COVID-related
costs, in saying that you expect them to stick around in 2021 or beyond this year. I just wanted to see if you can just clarify how much of it actually,
out of the total pool of COVID costs, do you actually think will stick around?

And then my actual question is just on Pepsi Beverages North America and its margin profile. So margins today are 400, 500 basis points below
the peak. So I'm just trying to understand how you're philosophically thinking about the migration of that margin back up to kind of where they
used to be. I mean, is this something that you want to really see happen quickly? Or do you think it will be a much more of a measured pace? Any
thoughts around that would be helpful.

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Yes. On the COVID cost, my point is, I don't know how the pandemic will evolve, but I think it's going to be very likely that we still have to be
very careful and keep our people safe for a large part of the year next year. It's not going to be as much as what we had this year, especially at the
beginning. I think we're getting better at this. We're finding more effective ways to run the business under this difficult circumstances. But there's
going to be a -- still some inefficiency and some additional cost because of COVID. So that was my point.

With regards to the PBNA business and the shape of its -- the portfolio and the profitability. Obviously, we want to get back to at much higher
levels. The speed of the transition to the higher levels will depend on our success to drive market share and to drive efficiency on our -- especially
S&D and supply chain, which is where I think we have more of the opportunity.

So we have a sense of urgency in all these, in becoming a better-performing top line company and in improving the efficiency of the business. As
you can see from the Q3 results, it's a good performance, but we're not going to sacrifice the long term for the short term. So we're going to continue
to invest in our brands, make sure that they're well-funded, that we'll continue to keep our consumers in our brands, keep them engaged. We
innovate with well-funded innovation, and that we invest in data. Especially, data and infrastructure investments are required to pivot to the multi
                                                                                                                                                                             
 -- the omnichannel world that we're living. And we're not going to sacrifice those investments for an accelerated profit improvement. But you
should see profit improvement in PBNA going forward.

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Ramon, if I can just add to Nik's question a bit on the COVID cost. Nik, to build on Ramon's answer a bit. Obviously, up front, there were sort of 2
implications. One was around taking reserves around potential losses due to customers exiting their businesses, particularly in the food service
area. And then the second piece of the cost is personal protective equipment and sanitation and things like that, which is more ongoing. In Q3 and
Q4, those numbers are sort of landing at about $150 million or so. Depending on the course of the pandemic for next year, obviously, we're going
to need to continue to protect our people. So those costs, obviously, will continue until we get to a point where we have a different outcome from
the perspective of the virus.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.

Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
You touched a little bit on your ability to move quickly in emerging markets to adjust pricing in a challenging macroeconomic environment. I was
curious, number one, the degree to which you've already started to make those moves. Because in some of those markets, the price/mix is a little
bit below what I'd modeled, but volume was a bit better. So I was curious kind of to what degree we've already started to put that playbook into
place.

And then from a longer-term perspective, Ramon, I think 1.5 years ago, when you first started communicating with The Street about your longer-term
plans, you talked about the need to broaden out the portfolio in international snacking into the value tiers, and that's where kind of your share
performance wasn't quite what it could be. So I was curious if you've made any progress on that front. Of course, knowing COVID kind of interrupted
business as usual, but I was curious about any progress there as well.

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, yes. It's good. No, listen, I think international is probably the biggest opportunity we have long term, right? I mean, the per caps in both our
beverages and our snacks still very low. And we see that as our #1 driver of future value for the company. So that's a big focus for us. We think the
levers to drive per capita consumption, affordability clearly is a big one for us. And we continue to make progress on adjusting our cost structures
to the different market realities. And that allows us to have much more flexibility on the price points and on the -- then what we decide to do with
the different levels of tiering of the market.

So the big enabler, if you want, for being a really affordable product, and that would drive per caps, is our cost structures. And I think we're making
great progress on adjusting a lot of the levers of that at the NR -- the cost, be it in the supply chain, be it in the G&A, be it in the selling and distribution.
So I think we're making great progress on adjusting the decisions we make on supply, delivery and management for the different realities in the
different developing markets. And that's driving affordability. That's driving, as you were saying, volume increase, even in a situation where a lot
of those markets are suffering. Obviously, a lot of small stores are still closed.

And there's a lot of adjustment to the COVID reality in many of those markets from the consumer and customer point of view. But our strategic
intent continues to be that one, reduction of costs, adjustment of the price points and continue to invest in the brands and the innovation that
will drive the per cap development in international.

Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala of Credit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
Can we talk a little bit about Quaker? And if we should be thinking about Quaker differently long-term in that right now, obviously, it's benefiting
from the environment that we're in. But is there anything happening there that might suggest trends could look different on a run rate basis for
that part of your business?

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Listen, a couple of things there. Number one, we are gaining penetration in a good way with Quaker, most of the segments in the Quaker
business, in these last 6 months. So we've gained penetration. We're investing to retain those new families and obviously to increase frequency in
the -- it was a pretty large penetrated brand, it's not a small penetrated. So make sure that consumers kind of reconnect with the brand; and with
the transformation we've made to the portfolio in the last few years, eliminating artificials or making the product, I would say, more forward-looking
products. So I think that work is in motion, and I think consumers are voting that they like our products, and we're gaining share in many of the
subsegments of the Quaker family.

Now going forward, our assumptions, and -- but it's still to be validated with future -- we need to see where the consumer really ends up. I think
there's going to be more cooking and eating occasions at home going forward. And especially, we think that breakfast, there will be at least 1 or
2 more occasions at home every week because I don't think we're going to go back to work in the same way that we used to. And that's our
assumption at this point.

Obviously, we can be right or we can wrong. But if you judge by how, in developed markets, everybody is thinking about their return to the offices,
I think it's going to be a much more flexible environment, a much more tech-enabled remote kind of work where consumers will be at home a few
days of the week. And that will drive, I think, a different behavior in terms of breakfast consumption and potentially some of the other mills during
the day, especially lunch.

So that's how we're thinking about the long-term category growth, and we're trying to position ourselves to compete well in that new environment,
where there should be more occasions for our products.

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein of Evercore.

Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Beverages Research & Fundamental
Research Analyst
First, just a clarification of your prerecorded tape, in which you said you expect the U.S. to be fairly steady, but international being somewhat
choppy. I'm wondering if you could tell us kind of what you actually saw in September in international markets to drive that.

And then my main question is you put out now some very interesting direct-to-consumer businesses in the U.S. Realizing that they're very small
today, but can you talk about what you're learning from those in terms of the consumer behavior, habits and innovation, and how you expect to
use those direct-to-consumer channels in the future.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. The direct-to-consumer models, as you're saying, is more of an attempt for us to stay closer to the consumer, read them, understand reaction
to early innovation, and then obviously take it mainstream into the balance of the channels. It is still, as you're saying, very embryo-nary, smaller
percentage. But we're getting good insights, and we plan to obviously scale them up a little bit and get better at reading consumers early, test and
learning with our innovation. And also improving the way we segment consumers. We have prototypes with consumers that we can innovate and
talk to in our communication. So that's the journey going forward.

In terms of the COVID in international, as you read around, there is an increase in COVID cases in especially Europe, I would say. They had managed
to control the pandemic pretty well. Now September, they've seen a number of cases going up. The way we're seeing governments managing the
situation so far is with local restrictions. When that happens, the business gets a little bit impacted, but not as much, obviously, as it was during
the April, May, more dramatic restrictions on people mobility.

So we're not seeing the business being impacted much at this point. That doesn't mean that as the winter comes and there is -- if they have -- the
governments have to take more restrictions, that the business may be a little bit more impacted, especially on the away-from-home and some of
the more capital channels.

So far, we haven't seen that. And we're seeing the governments making very -- a bit more balanced decisions between keeping the economy going
and trying to protect everybody against the spread of the pandemic. So that's the situation, especially in Europe, as we've seen the situation evolving
there.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.

Stephen Robert R. Powers - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Ramon, when you think back to the original faster, better, stronger framework that you laid out early last year and the investment priorities that
you laid out alongside that, I guess I'm curious just to hear whether the experiences of 2020 have altered those priorities at all. I'm interested
whether there are key things that have been permanently accelerated or added new to the mix versus other things that maybe have been
deprioritized even if only temporarily.

And I guess related to that, maybe this is for Hugh. Just -- I just note that CapEx for the year is about the -- is now coming in about $1 billion lower
versus the original outlook when 2020 started. And should we consider that simply a deferral? Or have you found efficiencies to more structurally
reduce those investments?

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
That's good question. Listen, I think we're happy that we had that framework going into this pandemic, right? Both the PepsiCo ways with very
clear behaviors for our people, it has helped us a lot in managing through the pandemic, especially when we have now a more kind of empower
organization, making more decisions in the front line. And they have a very, I think, good framework, clarity on what's expected, and I think that's
helping us perform.

In terms of the 3 vectors you were referring to, the faster, stronger, better. We're happy with the faster. Clearly, we're becoming more competitive
in the marketplace. As we look into the future, I think we're going to have to probably go more after drivers of share because categories might
slow down a little bit. So I think innovation brands, execution will play a very high role in trying to capture that market share.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 When you look at the stronger, we had some -- obviously, it was part of the agenda to invest in becoming a much better omni-channel company,
right? So e-commerce was big, supply chain flexibility was big to enable that omnichannel. Obviously, I mean, the -- what's happened, you saw
the numbers, the penetration of e-commerce or e-grocery has just accelerated by 3 years. So what we had forecasted to be 3, 4 years from now,
it's happening now. So that is a big focus of the organization. How do we accelerate the pivot into the omnichannel much faster? Which means
that we're going to have to up some of the capabilities that we have.

I think we've made great progress in how we deal with consumer data and how we have much more performance in marketing, we're improving
a lot of those capabilities, creating internal content. All that is happening on the flexibility of the supply chain as well. I think we were lucky that
we made a lot of investments in additional capacity last year, and that's helping us this year big time and helping us to have more flexibility. So
good progress there. I think we need to pivot with more of a sense of urgency.

The other area where we're doubling down is what we call holistic cost management. Holistic cost management was a capability we had. But
clearly, we need more of that in terms of being able to repurpose money from one part of the P&L to another part of the P&L., and where we have
inefficiencies, get rid of those inefficiencies to reinvest back we're going to get the best ROI in terms of growth and flow-through. So that capability,
I think we've made good progress. That's another area where we're putting a lot of emphasis.

On the better side, I would say the social consciousness, I mean, the need for becoming much more of a social company -- not social company, but
social-aware company, both in terms of the environment and the inequalities, I think has also increased given the pandemic. So you saw we
increased the foundation funding. We're also quite focused on improving all our environmental footprint.

So those are areas that, more than changing the trajectory, is more a sense of urgency to get them done earlier as the consumer and society is
expecting us to, I think, go faster in those areas.

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Steve, to finish off on your question around CapEx. Clearly, there's some element of timing as COVID's made it more difficult to execute capital
projects. But I would also tell you, we spent a lot of time and energy around identifying new low-cost sources of capital and doing things in a much
more efficient way. That clearly is going to benefit the level of spending going forward. So in terms of specifics, more to come in February. But I
would tell you, we are getting more efficient with capital spending.

Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
Great. Congratulations, guys. Great results so far year to date. Ramon, question for you. We've covered a lot of ground. I did want to ask you about
your openness to moving into the alcohol space, specifically hard seltzers. So as you know, the category has been growing rapidly. You've seen
Coca-Cola's launch here with Topo Chico in Latin America recently. They plan to launch in the U.S. next year with Molson Coors. There's also
discussion that Monster and perhaps some others, non-alcohol players, may be moving into the space.

So I was hoping you could comment on your openness to moving into hard seltzers. Is this an area that PepsiCo is looking at? How much time are
you spending internally? And then maybe some of the governors that may be in place around that possible decision.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, welcome. No, listen, our focus today, 100% focus, is getting the energy strategy right. Right, in terms of executing that. I think, as I said earlier,
it's a multi-vector strategy that requires both ROCKSTAR doing very well, it requires to do a great job with Bang, it requires innovation in Mountain
Dew to move into that space and then do a great job with Starbucks. So those 4 big pillars, that's taking a lot of our focus, and that's going to be
our priority, right, especially 2021. And I think you will see great progress in all those 4 front.

Now obviously, we look at every opportunity, right, there is in the industry. And a couple of years ago, it was CBD, now it's more alcohol. So we get
a lot of opportunities in front of us. Of course, we're looking at all of them, and of course, we have people that are thinking more long-term versus
the very immediate 2021. So we're reflecting, we're thinking what are the best options, and we will make decisions in the coming quarters whether
this is an area where PepsiCo wants to play. And then more importantly, how do we capture a lot of value of this opportunity? Given the 3-tier
system, it's not obvious how you capture a lot of value.

So there is a -- first, I would say, do we play or not? Second, very important, is who do we play with and who do we partner to maximize the value
for PepsiCo?

Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst and MD of the Consumer & Retail Team
Ramon and Hugh, and despite the current environment, definitely a strong quarter. So congrats to the entire team. A lot has been covered, so just
a clarification maybe on PBNA results. Strong results in the quarter, especially as the economics in there continued to suffer. So maybe you could
help us reconcile the difference between what we are seeing in Nielsen from your reported numbers. So could you tell us how big now is e-commerce
and on-premise channels for PBNA and the growth you are seeing in those 2 channels.

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, Laurent. I mean, there's been quite a discrepancy always between the Nielsen numbers and the full performance of PBNA. So I would not go
into the details of what is each channel. Obviously, e-commerce is booming and e-commerce is large. But there's much more than e-commerce
between the final, I would say, results of the company and what Nielsen covers in its review sample. So that's as much as I can say. There's obviously
away from home. There's many channels that are not well covered, including some, I would say, organized channels that are not well covered by
Nielsen.

Our final question will come from the line of Bill Chappell of Truist Securities.

Grant Blandford O'Brien - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just a quick one on Frito and the competitive dynamics in that space. You had a fairly large regional competitor
that is now public and talked about some geographic expansion opportunities across the U.S. So wondering if you guys have seen anything different
so far in the competitive dynamics or pricing in that space, or if you would expect to maybe over the next couple of years. I know there's been a
focus on share and holding share, gaining share in this call. So wondering if that would change your strategy or their strategy going forward.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Yes, great question. We like -- obviously, our category is savory, and there's a lot of people that like it as well. So it's obviously driving new entrants
from people that were not playing in savory and people that were playing in savory and have extended their ambitions to play beyond their original
geographical limitation.

So I think we welcome competition in that sense. To me, the more competitors, the more investments in the brands, the higher -- the larger the
category becomes. That's my experience globally, and I think it's everywhere in the world. So we welcome players to the arena. Players that -- they
play with the levers that I think develop the category, which is advertising, innovation, better products. Those are the levers that develop a category,
and we welcome anyone in the business.

It's hard to compete with freedom, right? Given the advantages that the company has, the scale of the brands, the distribution systems, the cost
advantage, everything else. So it's not easy to compete with Frito, but I think it's good that we have multiple competitors, and that develops a
category.

Welcome to the Constellation Brands Q2 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over
to Patty Yahn-Urlaub, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Patty Yahn-Urlaub - Constellation Brands, Inc. - VP of IR
Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Constellation's Second Quarter '21 Conference Call. I'm here this morning with Bill Newlands,
our CEO; and Garth Hankinson, our CFO.

As a reminder, reconciliations between the most directly comparable GAAP measure and any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call
are included in our news release or otherwise available on the company's website at cbrands.com.

Please refer to the news release and Constellation's SEC filings for risk factors, which may impact forward-looking statements we make on this call.

Before turning the call over to Bill, similar to prior quarters, I would like to ask that we limit everyone to one question per person, which will help
us to end our call on time.

Thanks in advance, and now here's Bill.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Patty. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before I begin with a discussion of our performance in the
quarter, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the continued and unprecedented challenges of this year marked by the ongoing impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic; ongoing social unrest rooted in a long history of racial injustice in this country; and the most recent string of natural disasters,
including wildfires across the western part of the United States.

As it relates to the fires, fortunately, all Constellation employees are safe and accounted for, and there have been no direct impacts to any of our
facilities. That said, our hearts go out to those who have been adversely affected by the fires, and we send our sincere thanks to the brave firefighters
and other emergency personnel working tirelessly to battle the fires and keep people safe.

I'd also like to thank the members of our Constellation team, who continued to pull together despite adverse circumstances to drive the success
of our business, including excellent second quarter results. As Garth and I review these results, we'd like you to focus on 3 key takeaways. First, in
what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID-related headwinds to deliver solid business
performance in Q2. This performance was led by our beer business, which grew depletions by almost 5% as we continue to see incredible consumer
demand for our portfolio of brands.

While the COVID-related slowdown of our beer production in Mexico earlier in the year impacted shipments and net sales in Q2 and created some
temporary out of stocks at retail, we are quickly recovering and expect inventory to return to normal levels by the end of Q3, and we're beginning
to see accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to ensure that consumers can find their favorite Constellation products
on the shelf at retail.

Second, our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction as our higher-end wine power brands outpace the U.S. high-end
wine category in IRI.

Regarding the Gallo transaction, both Constellation and Gallo remain committed to completing this transaction, and we're very encouraged by
the progress that we've been making. We continue to receive positive feedback from the FTC staff and addressing the concerns that they raised
related to the transaction. Based on our interactions with the FTC, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review
and approval in the coming weeks. We're happy to say that this marks the final stage in this process. Once final approval is received, closing can
happen quickly, which allows us to forge ahead with the strategy for our wine and spirits business.

And third, the strong performance delivered by our beer and wine and spirits businesses drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further
reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in
fiscal '21.

Let's move to a more fulsome discussion of our beer business performance in the quarter. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, including
the continued partial closure of the on-premise, which was down 50% in the quarter year-on-year, Constellation's beer business continues to be
one of the largest contributors to U.S. beer industry growth.

During the second quarter, our beer business delivered 11% growth in IRI channels overall and more than 15% growth for our priority SKUs. This
performance was driven by 12% IRI growth for Modelo Especial as the brand solidified its position as the #3 beer brand in the U.S. beer market,
and the brand family is on track to deliver its 35th consecutive year of growth.

The Corona Brand family also grew double digits in IRI channels, with the most significant contributions coming from Corona Hard Seltzer, Corona
Premier and Corona Extra. We continue to be thrilled with the performance of Corona Hard Seltzer. Despite launching this new brand in the midst
of a pandemic, which presented us with -- prevented us from engaging in a number of the activities conducive to introducing a new brand, Corona
Hard Seltzer has become one of the most successful new product launches in our company's history. With the launch of only one SKU to date, the
brand continues to exceed our expectations and has already achieved the #4 position in the category.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 To put this in perspective, Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer. Let me repeat that: Corona Hard Seltzer is the second
fastest moving hard seltzer for those seltzer brands with significant distribution and velocity and remains strong as we continue to pick up
distribution. These ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 70% since product launched in March. And to date, the
brand has maintained incrementality levels at the 90% rate, significantly outcasting our expectations.

Corona Hard Seltzer over indexes to the Hispanic consumer relative to its competitors, which unlocks an untapped opportunity for this category
with the fastest-growing demographic in the country. Currently, 15% to 20% of brand volume is estimated to come from Hispanic consumers,
while other seltzer brands are closer to 10% to 15%.

Our expectations for the hard seltzer category growth are extremely high, and our intention is to become a top 3 player in the hard seltzer market
as we believe there's a natural and compelling connect between what the Corona Brand stands for and what consumers want in a seltzer, refreshing
great taste hint the flavor and ours at 0 carbs, 0 sugars and only 90 calories. In the future, you'll see us expand with new flavors, new packages and
even new platforms. So stay tuned.

From an operational perspective, we continue to engage in constructive conversations with the Mexican government as it relates to our future
plans for production in Mexico. Meanwhile, we're progressing with the 5 million hectoliter expansion of our Obregon facility, which is expected to
be completed by the end of this fiscal year. As a reminder, after the completion of the Obregon capacity expansion, we believe we will have ample
capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer demand over the medium term. This includes more than doubling of our seltzer
production capacity heading into our next fiscal year.

Let's now move to the quarterly results for our wine and spirits business. I'm pleased that we're nearing the finish line with the Gallo transaction,
which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. It also aligns with the vision
for our business to be a bold and innovative higher-end wine and spirits company with distinctive brands and products delivering exceptional
consumer experiences.

During the quarter, we continued to see the staying power of the consumer-led premiumization trend with premium price point segments
continuing to outpace value price segments, further reinforcing the strategy of our business. In fact, our higher-end wine power brands at the
greater than $11 retail price point outpaced the U.S. high-end wine category in IRI channels driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and the Prisoner
portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels for the quarter. These trends drove excellent margin performance for the business
as price and mix benefits for this higher-end stable of brands drove significant margin enhancement. Throughout the remainder of the year, we
plan to continue to invest in capabilities that position our wine and spirits business for long-term success.

The wine and spirits innovation pipeline is primed with impactful product introductions as we enter the peak seasonal period for the business.
These initiatives are aligned with the key consumer macro trends of betterment, convenience and sustainability that we believe can drive scale
going forward.

Key product launches include the Prisoner Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay varietals, SVEDKA and High West ready-to-drink cocktails, Ruffino
wine spritzer and Meiomi Cabernet Sauvignon. These initiatives will be supported throughout the remainder of the year with impactful marketing
campaigns to strengthen and build the portfolio.

And while we're already a leading player in 3 tier e-commerce, we're excited about our renewed focus on the direct-to-consumer space with our
acquisition of Empathy and our minority investment in the Booker Vineyard's business as we believe e-commerce, including DTC, can become a
key growth driver for our business.

E-commerce for beverage alcohol has exploded due to the pandemic, increasing 3 to 4x in volume versus prior year. We were focused on e-commerce
as a growing channel even before COVID and have further accelerated our strategy with increased resources and focus on digital shelf management
and redeploying marketing dollars to support our digital commerce channels.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Now I'd like to take a minute to address the unfortunate wildfire situation in the west in a bit more detail. As mentioned, and thankfully, all of our
employees are accounted for and safe, and no Constellation properties have been impacted by the fires. While we're more than 70% through
harvest, it is still too early to determine the overall impact the fires and resulting smoke might have on this year's vintage. However, we continue
to perform extensive testing and evaluation, and we have considered a number of potential contingencies and options as we progress through
harvest based on our perspective at this point. That said, we are committed to providing consumers with the same high-quality wine they've come
to expect from our higher-end brands. And despite potential impacts from the fires, we fully expect to be able to meet consumer demand for our
excellent portfolio of products. Garth will provide some additional details in a few minutes on that topic.

Now moving to our ventures portfolio. Last year, we announced our commitment to invest $100 million to support African-American black and
minority-owned start-ups in the beverage alcohol space as part of our efforts to enhance diversity and access to opportunity within our industry.
We're happy to say we've received significant interest in this program to date. We've also made good progress over the past several years with our
focus on Female Founders initiative as female-funded and/or female-led businesses now account for more than half of our ventures portfolio. We
see an opportunity to make similar progress in supporting African-American black and minority businesses in the coming years and look forward
to updating you on our progress.

We've recently acquired a minority stake in the Booker Vineyard's business, a super luxury direct-to-consumer focused wine portfolio to further
align our wine and spirits business to changing consumer preferences. We believe this relationship strengthens our fine wine portfolio and our
long-term aspiration to build a strong omnichannel business that includes category leadership in DTC and 3 Tier e-commerce.

Additionally, we recently acquired the remaining interest in Copper & Kings American branding company, which marks our first full ventures
acquisition. Copper & Kings is a cutting-edge distillery that primarily produces highly-differentiated American brandy with a tasting room and
restaurant located in the heart of urban country in Louisville, Kentucky. This acquisition allows us to play in the rapidly emerging craft spirits market,
where premiumization trends remain robust.

Finally, we're pleased with the progress that the Canopy Growth team has made in prioritizing a strategic direction to focus on what's needed to
become a world-class CPG company. They've identified goals for their core markets, rightsized their footprint, balanced supply and demand needs,
improved execution and made progress in reducing operating expenses and cash burn.

I'm especially excited about the successful launch of the Rec 2.0 cannabis beverage products in the Canadian cannabis market, where Canopy has
a 75% market share and the top 4 SKUs in the category, shipping more than 1.6 million cans since launch in March. For comparison, in the calendar
year 2019, a total of 4 million cans of cannabis beverages were sold in the entire U.S. market over the course of that year. So great progress to date.
We believe that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to the market and further drive conversion from the illicit market.
And earlier today, Canopy growth announced plans to bring its line of cannabis beverages to the U.S. next summer through its revised agreement
with Acreage Holdings. Overall, Canopy remains the best position to win long term in the emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face
the challenges associated with this current economic environment.

In closing, I want to take you back to the 3 key takeaways mentioned at the top. I'm extremely proud of the results our team has driven in the face
of continued adversity. And what was expected to be our most challenging quarter of the year, our team overcame COVID related headwinds to
deliver solid business performance in Q2. Our beer business continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, and we're seeing accelerating
consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as we work to rebuild our inventory position.

Our wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction, and we are in the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo,
which paves the way for accelerated growth and margin performance for our wine and spirits business going forward. And our performance in the
quarter drove strong cash generation, allowing us to further reduce our debt and progress towards our desired leverage range. As a result, we are
well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.

This year also marks our company's 75th anniversary. We have a strong legacy of success that we're extremely proud of. Our continued growth
and resilience will help ensure the future of our company remains extremely bright. And as I often like to say to our team, we firmly believe the
very best is yet to come.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And with that, I would like to now turn it over to Garth, who will review our financial results for the second quarter.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, Bill, and hello, everyone.

Despite an uncertain economic environment and headwinds related to COVID-19, Constellation Brands continues to generate strong financial
results. During our second quarter, we generated comparable basis EPS, excluding Canopy growth, of $2.91, continued to deliver strong margins
in both our beer and wine and spirits segments and increased free cash flow by 10%, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and progress in achieving
targeted leverage.

Now let's review Q2 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results, starting with beer. Despite reduced
shipment volume in Q2 related to COVID-19, net sales were flat to prior year. Excluding the impact of the Ballast Point divestiture, organic net sales
increased 1% on organic shipment volume down 1%, which was partially offset by favorable pricing.

Depletion volume growth for the quarter came in at nearly 5% driven by Modelo Especial and the successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer as
strong performance continued in the off-premise channel and more than offset the impact of the nearly 50% year-over-year reduction in the
on-premise channel due to COVID-19.

In Q2, we benefited from one extra sell day. When adjusted for the extra sell day impact, the beer business generated approximately 4% depletion
volume growth. In Q3, depletion selling days are flat year-over-year.

While depletion trends tempered in Q2 versus Q1 due to some out of stocks resulting from the slowdown in production earlier in the fiscal year,
we remain confident in the strength of our business as underlying consumer demand remains quite robust. We are making good progress in
rebuilding inventory supply across our network, both at our distribution centers and with distributors, following the production slowdown for
nearly -- for roughly 2/3 of our Q1 and the beginning of Q2 that created out of stocks at retail and negatively impacted depletions during the
quarter. We expect distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels by the end of Q3 as shipment volume is expected to outpace
depletion volume during the quarter.

Moving on to beer margins. Beer gross margin of 55.7% was flat to prior year as favorable pricing and the benefit of the Ballast Point divestiture
was offset by unfavorable mix and increased operational costs driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at our breweries,
resulting in unfavorable fixed cost absorption.

Marketing as a percent of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 8.4% as marketing spend decreased resulting from COVID-19-related sporting and
sponsorship event cancellations and/or postponements. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, beer operating margins increased 70 basis
points to 42.5%.

Looking ahead to the balance of the year, a couple of items to touch on from a beer segment perspective. First, we plan on taking selective price
increases this fall. For our pricing strategy, we implement price increases annually on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis depending on the
dynamics within a given market. This year, our pricing approach remains intact. However, the timing of the price increases could be more staggered
throughout the back half of the fiscal year and in some instances may shift into the beginning of our fiscal year 2020. With that said, for fiscal '21,
we still expect 1% to 2% of pricing within our Mexican portfolio.

Second, our marketing spend in the first half of our fiscal year was significantly muted as a percentage of net sales decreased to 8.6% due to the
lack of sporting and sponsorship events. However, during the back half of the fiscal year, we are committed to an increase in spending behind our
brands, especially by leveraging the return to sports. As such, we expect marketing spend in the range of 9% to 10% of net sales on a full year basis.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Moving to wine and spirits. Our wine and spirits power brand strategy continues to gain momentum as marketplace performance for our higher-end
power brands continues to outpace the higher-end segment. However, as expected, power brand depletion volume decelerated during the quarter
resulting in a 1% decline, while overall depletion volume for Q2 declined 3%, reflecting the brands to be divested.

To better align with our strategy for the business going forward, we did not replicate some lower return incentive programs and pricing initiatives
that ran during our Q2 fiscal '20. During the quarter, we also worked to rightsize inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states. While
this drove a negative impact to depletion trends in the quarter, this will allow us to better manage inventories on a go-forward basis.

Wine and spirits net sales declined 11% on shipment volume, down 19%. Excluding the impact of the Black Velvet divestiture, organic net sales
declined 9%, reflecting shipment volume decline of approximately 17%, partially offset by robust price and mix benefits in the quarter. Q2 net sales
results outperformed our previously communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the brands to be divested driven
by the timing of the Gallo transaction.

Operating margin increased 310 basis points to 25.9% as benefits from price and mix, along with lower marketing spend, were partially offset by
higher COGS and SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Higher COGS mostly reflect increased packaging costs, including glass and labels, partially
offset by lower rate costs.

In Q2, we experienced continued margin expansion driven by shipment volume mix resulting from some of our fast-moving power brands, such
as Kim Crawford, Meiomi and the Prisoner brand family, and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA. In addition, we saw lower promotions
as some incentive programming activities did not occur due to the current operating environment and COVID-19-related closures for the on-premise.

The marketing benefit to margin in the quarter is mostly related to timing as we plan to shift marketing dollars from the first half into the second
half of the fiscal year to support key marketing and advertising initiatives for our power brands and innovation launches as we enter our peak
selling season. Let me point out that a majority of the shift will occur in Q3, resulting in an increase in year-over-year spend for the quarter.

As Bill discussed, during August, significant wildfires broke out in California, Oregon and Washington State. We are currently monitoring and
assessing the impact of the smoke damage from these wildfires as we progress through the August to October harvest season. At this time, we do
not expect a material impact to our ability to meet consumer demand. However, we expect our margins to be impacted as we recognize costs in
the remainder of the fiscal year due to decreased production levels, driving unfavorable fixed cost absorption. Currently, we are estimating these
costs of about $25 million to $35 million in Q3 and $10 million to 50 -- $15 million in Q4 fiscal '21.

As Bill mentioned, we expect a consent decree will be submitted to the commissioners for review and approval in the coming weeks and, therefore,
expect the Gallo and other ancillary deals to close by the end of Q3. Therefore, we are expecting reported net sales for wine and spirits to be flattish
to prior year in Q3 while expecting a decline of 20% to 25% in reported wine and spirits operating income, reflecting the negative impact of the
wildfires and increased marketing expense during the quarter.

Now let's proceed with the rest of the P&L. Fiscal year-to-date corporate expenses came in at approximately $110 million, up 13% versus fiscal --
versus last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and an
increase in charitable contributions primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend. Comparable basis interest
expense for the quarter decreased 10% to approximately $100 million primarily due to lower average borrowings as we continue to decrease our
leverage ratio.

Our Q2 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 16.9% versus 15.2% in Q2 last year primarily driven
by higher effective tax rates on our foreign businesses, partially offset by an increased benefit from stock-based compensation. While our pre-COVID
estimated full year FY '21 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, was 18%, we now expect the rate to
approximate 19%. The 1 percentage point rate increase versus our pre-COVID estimate primarily reflects an estimated higher marginal rate on
foreign earnings.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Moving to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for
the first half of fiscal '21. This represents an impressive 10% increase. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower
CapEx.

Fiscal year-to-date CapEx totaled $278 million or approximately 22% below last year's spend. This included approximately $200 million of beer
CapEx primarily driven by the 5 million hectoliter expansion project at our Obregon brewery, which we expect to be completed by the end of fiscal
2021.

Moving to Canopy. In Q2, we recognized a $48 million decrease in the fair value of Canopy investments. These impacts were excluded from
comparable basis results. The total pretax net gain recognized since our initial Canopy investment in November of 2017 is $64 million. In August,
Canopy reported first quarter fiscal '21 results. We are pleased with the progress that has been made since David Klein took over as CEO in rightsizing
the business, reducing the company's cash burn and improving free cash flow. We are bullish on the growth prospects for Canopy growth as they
continue to execute against their strategic plan.

Now let's shift the discussion to outlook and guidance. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact
consumers and the marketplace almost concurrently with the start of our fiscal year and given the related uncertainty, volatility and fast-moving
developments that have evolved during the first half of our fiscal year, we still do not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial
guidance for fiscal '21 at this time. However, let me reiterate that in a normalized environment, our medium-term growth algorithm remains
unchanged for both our beer and wine and spirits segments.

In closing, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. While we remain focused on our goal of returning $5 billion to shareholders in the
form of dividends and share repurchases through fiscal '23, in the short term given the volatile environment, we remain focused on paying down
debt and further reducing our leverage ratio. In fact, we've reduced our net debt by nearly $600 million since the end of fiscal '20, resulting from
our strong cash flow generation while continuing to maintain our quarterly dividend rate.

And with that, Bill and I are happy to take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Lee Herzog - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I wanted to ask a little bit about the spending that, Garth, you just kind of touched on. A key driver of your strong operating margins in the quarter
really has been a result of lower marketing spend. And now you've talked about your outlook for spending for the full year being between 9% and
10% as a percentage of sales, which is about 50 bps lower than your previous guidance. So I kind of wanted to better understand that this is mainly
a function of the ongoing pressures from COVID. Or do you see this maybe more as a realistic run rate going forward in terms of what you're seeing
with your depletions and demand for your brands? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how you guys are balancing things and really how important
it is for you to drive continued margin expansion.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure, Bonnie. Let me take the first part of that, Garth. Our expected run rate is no different going forward than it's ever been. At the same point,
because so much of our live events and sports were delayed in the year, I mean think about the NBA Finals, hockey, baseball playoffs, many --
football, many of the things that we advertised on were pushed back later in the year, and therefore, into our third quarter. Some of our spend was

                                                                                                                                                                             
 also pushed back into those time frames as well. So our intention is to have a consistent run rate of spend in that 9% to 10% range as we always
have, and you will expect to see a little bit more in the third quarter because many of those pre-bought scenarios will take place during that quarter
rather than in the second quarter when we had originally anticipated they would occur.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes, and the only thing that I would add to that, Bonnie, is from a margin perspective, right, we continue to think that the right range to think about
in terms of our beer margins are at 39% to 40%. Obviously, in any given year, we're going to face headwinds or tailwinds that are going to fluctuate
a little bit. But those are best-in-class margins, and that's the right way to think about the business on a go-forward basis.

Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC.

Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages & Lead Consumer Staples
Analyst
So Bill, I just wanted to have a chat on shelf space, right? So you guys have obviously been very active with the shopper first initiative, ran into a
bit of a hiccup with supply/demand. So maybe you can just kind of give us a state of the union on are -- have you lost any spacing as a result of the
out of stocks? Because that has happened in a few categories. So if you could just give us an update there.

And number two, how do you think the retail psychology is evolving as the last 6 months has gone on? Clearly, Constellation has been under space
for a very long time. So I'm just curious like where the retail universe is right now in terms of your actual slot in the core.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. The -- certainly, the space issue has been somewhat challenging over the very most recent past, simply because of the reduction in production
that we had around COVID-19. With that said, we have seen very little reduction of our overall space as we have spread out our product mix and
our product offering into the existing space that we already had. We're also fortunate that many retailers have moved their resets and their timing
back in the year for the same reason as because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which now matches up with the time when we're expecting to have
our inventory levels back in a more normalized fashion during this quarter.

So we don't see any long-term issue around that. We've been very straightforward with our retail partners about where we are. And as you well
state, our business, if anything, demands more space given the great acceleration that our brands have in the marketplace. And we expect that
over time, we will continue to gain in the distribution area much as we have over the last several years.

Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
As it relates to inventories, it looks like kind of year-to-date, you're running with shipments down about 4%, depletions up about 5%, and that's
during a seasonal peak period. To get inventories back to where you want them by the end of Q3, what should we be thinking about in terms of
the spread between shipments and depletions?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So Kaumil, thanks for the question. I'd say that the spread between depletions and shipments is going to top to gauge as we move through
the quarter because it'll largely be dependent upon what depletions look like. And we've actually seen -- as Bill noted, we've actually seen very
strong continued consumer takeaway in IRI, and depletion growth remains very robust.

Suffice that to say, we do know that there will be a dislocation -- not really dislocation, but a difference in between shipments and depletions for
the quarter. How much remains to be seen will be driven by consumer takeaway.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Let me just add to that. I'm sure that you have seen in the most recent 4-week share data that our brands are accelerating as we bring more and
more of them back to the table. I think as Garth points out, that's going to be a big factor in terms of what the balance is of that. Depletions are
certainly accelerating, we're very pleased with that, but it's very tough to give you an exact answer without knowing how that will land during the
course of the quarter.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.

Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So I'm curious, Bill, it sounds like you're very constructive on the momentum that you've established early days on the Corona Hard Seltzer offering.
Curious to hear how you're thinking about positioning a new hard seltzer offering and taking a portfolio approach to the category.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, we've shipped about 5.5 million cases year-to-date, which is ahead of what we had expected, and we're very excited about it. As I already
said, our velocity against literally one SKU is second in the category. So everything that's occurring around Corona Hard Seltzer has been sort of
positive to what our initial expectations are.

As we already also stated, we're going to be in a position to put additional SKUs into the marketplace next year. We would -- we've already said
also that our capacity would more than double next year. And keep in mind, we have a minority investment in PRESS, which we're very excited
about. PRESS has performed exceedingly well. And as we've said in prior calls, we do expect some price stratification to occur over time in the
seltzer category. So PRESS is very positive.

We've also done some very limited regional things like Funky Buddha in Florida. In Florida, that particular brand is in the top 5 of all seltzers in the
state of Florida. So we've got our toes in the water on a number of areas. Corona Hard Seltzer will continue to be our lead, but we certainly have
other opportunities to continue to gain share in what is becoming a very important subsegment of the beer business.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Garth, I just wanted to follow up on the incremental costs in the wine segment. So I guess 2 questions related to it. First are the costs that you
highlighted, are they relevant to the -- or related to the ongoing business, so separate from the piece that's going off in the divestiture to Gallo?

And then second, I guess trying to understand if this at all impacts kind of the timing or the cadence of supply chain for the wine business going
into next year. And I guess what I'm trying -- I'm thinking of it is, are you -- is there a delay in terms of pressing grapes and putting juice in the tanks?
Is there a delay in pulling product out of the tank and bottling? I'm just really just trying to understand if there's going to be any kind of disruption
in the flow of the supply chain in wine that might lead into next year.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So the costs, as I outlined them, are for the remaining business, for the business that we are retaining, not for
what we're divesting to Gallo. And as it relates to the question on supply chain, we don't expect there to be any material impact on our ability to
meet consumer demand as we go forward. We have lots of flexibility in how we source grapes and fruit, whether that's through the bulk line market,
the bulk line that we have on hand, our own vineyards, relationships we have with other growers. We don't see any impact on our ability to meet
consumer takeaway.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
So Bill, you mentioned your aspiration to be a top 3 player in the seltzer category -- hard seltzer category longer term. Obviously, you just touched
on some of the new SKUs that you have planned. But can you also give us a sense for how important new platforms will be in that aspiration long
term in terms of becoming a top 3 player? And is that more of a longer-term focus? Or could we see a big push behind new entries of brands in
the hard seltzer more near term?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will be our primary approach to this category. As we stated, given our roughly $10 million capability for this
year, we've relied on one -- literally one SKU. So as we go forward and we expand and finish the Obregon expansion that I discussed earlier, that
gives us the opportunity to extend our reach within the Corona Hard Seltzer franchise.

We're a big believer that Corona is the perfect brand to maintain our lead focus for seltzer because it meets up exactly with the whole brand essence
of refreshment, relaxation and finding your beach. So it -- that will continue to be the lead play for us, but we're always exploring what consumers
are interested in going forward. And yes, we do have some additional things that we'll be talking to you about in future conference calls as to what
we expect to do during the next fiscal year.

 Sean Roberts King - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst of Beverages
Yes, I wanted to dig a little bit more into what you're seeing in the month of September. I know you mentioned like based on the IRI data that we're
seeing a gradual acceleration as you're getting more on the shelves, but in terms of the on-premise that you're seeing there would be helpful. And
what I've been hearing is that there's fewer taps at most of the outlets that are open, if that's a potential headwind or a benefit for your portfolio.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise versus much of the competition with our brands. With that said, there's --
we had 50% closure in the second quarter. We had 75% in the first, and it's looking more and more like that will also reduce another 15% to 20%
during the third quarter if things continue as they're going.

With that said, admittedly, the quarter -- I mean, excuse me, the month literally ended yesterday, so we're still adding it up. But it certainly looks
like we're going to have a significantly better depletion month in September than we have year-to-date. In fact, it could quite well be our best
month of the year so far. That matches up entirely with the acceleration that you've seen in IRI data over the last 4 weeks, which has been accelerating
and returned us to a gaining share position, which is something we've normally seen in our business over the course of time.

Great. This is building on Nik's question earlier. This is for you, Bill. Just the outlook for the Modelo brand looking out over the next few years and
kind of pass some of the near-term volatility related to COVID comes up frequently with investors, understandably given the importance of the
brands to your outlook. So could you comment on your ability to grow volumes in that business double digits over the next few years? As we look
at the Nielsen channels, ACV is less of an opportunity. But as was pointed out, shelf space is an opportunity. So maybe comment on that a bit, talk
a little bit about the interplay and your ability to drive that kind of growth, the interplay between Modelo with the Corona brand. And then just
lastly, perhaps touch on, is it in the consideration sector that you would extend the Modelo brand into seltzers as well?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. As we've said, Modelo is one of the chief growth drivers of our beer business. Modelo Especial has become the #3 beer brand in the U.S.
market, and it continues to accelerate, part of -- it does that for a number of reasons. One is it continues to have a disproportionate SKU in the
Hispanic community, which is a growing demographic in the United States, but we've also radically extended that into the non-Hispanic community.
Jim Sabia has been advertising to the non-Hispanic community only for the last few years. So this is relatively new that we've been expanding the
reach, particularly in Modelo Especial.

As you know, our Chelada introductions have gone extremely well, one after the next. And certainly, it's continued to see growth in Negra as well.
So the overall family is very healthy. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at the 35th consecutive year of growth for that brand. And
quite honestly, I don't know how high is up. I think there's -- there remains tremendous opportunity to extend that franchise, both with its core
Hispanic community as well as the non-Hispanic marketplace into which we've started to advertise.

I highly doubt that we will do a seltzer under that brand. We believe that the core essence of that brand focuses much more on full flavored beer.
And any innovation that we might approach on that particular brand will follow more of the brand essence of the Modelo brand rather than what
we have done with Corona, where we feel the whole refreshment platform matches up perfectly with the hard seltzer subsegment.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
So I wanted to go back to the depletions commentary. I understand there are obviously a lot of puts and takes, but you sounded optimistic. So Bill,
are you running in the mid-single digits as you alluded to before or even at the high single digits for beer depletions in September?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, as I said earlier, and I'll maintain that thought given we have not even gotten all the numbers in yet, and therefore, Garth has not added them
all up. But it appears that September will be significantly better than what our year-to-date has been. And as I said, it very likely will be our single
best month of the year.

So we continue to be optimistic that what we've seen on takeout and IRI trends that have occurred over the last 4 weeks is currently being reflected
in our increased depletion trend that we're seeing in September, which again matches up with our expectation given we have been back operating
at normal levels within the plant now for a significant period of time.

So again, it's a little difficult to put an exact number on it right at this point, but it certainly looks like September was a very, very positive month.

Andrea Faria Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
And if I can squeeze -- that's helpful, Bill. If I can squeeze just a margin question. I know it's like you just quoted some of the expenses that are -- I
mean, obviously, the COVID expenses. Other than those, like which may or may not recur as we lap next year, are we looking at obviously a better
outlook now that production is when -- it's where it should be and you're reaching back to the production and you're getting obviously economies
of scale and you're getting your seltzer volumes like as you quoted better than anticipated? Should we see a progression in like long-term outlook
for margins to continue to build or you're going to have to invest more into the pricing? The pricing commentary obviously is going to last, but
you're going to increase the pricing through the beginning of fiscal -- we could go into fiscal, but I'm just thinking of the puts and takes of FX and
volumes coming back, how we should be thinking about margins going forward.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So margins for our beer business going forward, as we said earlier, the right range to think about them is, as we said previously, which is that
39% to 40% range, right, again, best-in-class margins. In any given year, we're going to have puts and takes as it relates to margins. We're going to
get the benefits of our pricing, but we're also going to face headwinds around things like incremental depreciation that flows through cost of
goods as well as we build and add capacity, we'll have periods where we have lower utilization rates, which can -- which will have a drag. And so
as we say, there's always going to be these puts and takes in any given year, but 39% to 40% is the right way to think about our margin profile over
the medium term.

And on the seltzer point that you raised, seltzer currently is a drag given the additional flavors and some of the co-packing that needs to be done
there. As we progress and as we get to be -- have more scale in seltzer, there'll definitely be margin improvement there, and we'll start to get closer
in line with Corona Extra glass. But again, even as margins improve on seltzer, that there will be other puts and takes. So 39% to 40% is the right
way to think about it.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore.

Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Beverages Research & Fundamental
Research Analyst
Bill, I just want to kind of step back and ask you a big picture question that you're probably in a better position to answer than anybody else. And
that is at least based on the data we get, and for spirits, it's not that good, but even with the tremendous boost that the beer industry has gotten
from hard seltzers, it looks like spirits are gaining share of throat and that maybe even have accelerated this year. And based on what you see, is
that, in fact, true? And what do you account for that? Is it the out of stocks for beer? Or is there something -- due to the COVID environment that
favors spirits? And if these trends look like they're going to continue, are you thinking just in terms of your long-term capital allocation to pivot
more towards spirits? I know you just made a spirits acquisition. But just how are you thinking about that dynamic?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure, Rob. It's very difficult in a COVID year to make lots of predictions about what will be sustainable and what will maintain itself once we come
out of the COVID scenario and what won't. I do think it's very fair to say there will be some fundamental change. Some of that fundamental change
will be about 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, things that we're investing a lot of our energy and focus on going forward. So I wouldn't
make a lot of prediction as to what the adjustments that could occur between spirits or beer or wine.

What I would say is we have worked aggressively, as you've seen, to make sure that our portfolio is positioned for where the consumer is going,
not where the consumer has been. We've invested in craft spirits, which we think has tremendous upside. Our beer business plays in the high end,
which is where the growth in the category is. We're extending our capabilities in seltzer to more than double what we have done in this fiscal year
going forward. And our wine business is tremendously positioned to continue to leverage the premiumization trend that's going on. In addition
to that, we're doing the kinds of innovations that the consumer is looking for in things like betterment and convenience. You're seeing that in some
of the new products that we've talked about this year.

That's where our focus really lies, and I think there's tremendous opportunity within our portfolio no matter how it shakes out post-COVID. As I
said, I do think there will be some fundamental change about how the consumer buys. And to some degree, there almost has to be because there
has been a significant shift from the on-premise to the off-premise. And I think that the long-term trend of that, I still think, is too early to predict.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.

Grant Blandford O'Brien - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
This is Grant on for Bill. Just had one on the wine and spirits power brand's depletion growth this quarter. I was just hoping, Garth, you give a bridge
on some of those impacts you walked through the inventory changes at the distributor level and the promotional changes. Just trying to get an
underlying growth number for that business.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. The -- I think the question is that you want to understand sort of like why the power brand growth wasn't higher than you were expecting,
and that really is because we did do -- we didn't repeat some non-return generating promotional activity or take some non-enhancing --
non-value-enhancing pricing actions. And we also cleaned up or reduced the number of days outstanding with some key retailers. So the underlying

                                                                                                                                                                             
 brands are strong as you see in the IRI takeaway, and the reduction or a slowdown in depletions really is just -- is doing a little bit of house cleaning,
so to speak.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Keep in mind, Bill, if I could add -- just to add to Garth's comment, our high-end over $11 power brands continue to outpace their competition,
and that's led by Meiomi and the Prisoner family, Kim Crawford. These brands are accelerating in the minds of consumer.

Keep in mind, going back to sort of Robert's question from a minute ago, one of the things that we continue to see is people are attracted to try
and true brands. And we are very fortunate when you talk about our beer business or our wine business or our spirit business to have a lot of those
brands that are inherently trusted, and that has been extremely helpful for us during the pandemic.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst and MD of the Consumer & Retail Team
Another question on seltzer. With the launch of Topo Chico seltzer next year, there will be more competition to attract Hispanic consumers into
the seltzer category potentially from beer. So first, I mean do you see Topo Chico seltzer as a risk for your core Mexican beer business? And second,
what are your plan with Corona seltzer to increase Hispanic penetration that seems to be low by your account?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, as I said earlier, we have been very pleased by the development of our Corona Hard Seltzer business with the Hispanic community. It's indexing
somewhere between 5 and 10 points greater than the overall category, and we think that speaks very well to broadening the reach of the seltzer
subsegment with consumers. So we're very positive about that.

As I'm sure you've seen, there's been a lot of introductions in the seltzer category, but consumers have a tendency to go with tried and true, trusted
brands. And there is really no stronger brand that's trusted in the minds of consumers than Corona. And certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will fall into
that ZIP code as well. So we always wish well for our competition, but we'll be quite happy to do our bit, and we'll see how it all falls out.

Operator
Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bill Newlands for any
further remarks.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Jonathan. So thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Despite the continued and unprecedented challenges that have occurred
since the beginning of our fiscal year, our team continues to remain agile and have overcome massive headwinds to deliver strong business
performance in the first half of our fiscal year. We remain confident in the resiliency of our business.

Our beer business, as we've discussed today, continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, while our wine and spirit premiumization
strategy continues to gain momentum, especially as we enter the final stages of completing our transaction with Gallo. We remain bullish on the
                                                                                                                                                                             
 future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, and we are well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth
in fiscal '21.

Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. So I'm wishing everyone at this point a safe and happy holiday season, and I'm also reminding
you to enjoy some of our great products during your socially-distant celebrations with your family and friends.

OVERVIEW
Co. reported 2Q21 comparable-basis EPS, excluding Canopy growth, of $2.91.

FINANCIAL DATA
   A. 2Q21 comparable-basis EPS (excluding Canopy growth) = $2.91.
   B. YTD total CapEx = $278m.

PRESENTATION SUMMARY
I. 2Q21 REVIEW (B.N.)

   A. Challenges:
      1. Continued and unprecedented challenges of this year are marked by ongoing impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing
         social unrest rooted in a long history of racial injustice in this country and most recent string of natural disasters, including
         wildfires across western part of US.
        a. As it relates to fires, fortunately, all employees are safe and accounted for, and there have been no direct impacts to any
           of Co.'s facilities.
      2. Team continued to pull together, despite adverse circumstances, to drive success of business, including excellent 2Q results.
   B. Three Key Takeaways:
      1. In what was expected to be Co.'s most challenging qtr. of year, team overcame COVID-related headwinds to deliver solid
         business performance in 2Q.
        a. This performance was led by beer business, which grew depletions almost 5%, as Co. continued to see incredible consumer
            demand for its portfolio of brands.
        b. While COVID-related slowdown of beer production in Mexico earlier in the year impacted shipments and net sales in 2Q
            and created some temporary out-of-stocks at retail, Co. is quickly recovering and expects inventory to return to normal
            levels by 3Q-end.
        c. Beginning to see accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels, as Co. works to ensure that consumers can find
            their favorite STZ products on shelf at retail.
      2. Wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction, as Co.'s higher-end wine Power Brands outpaced US
         high-end wine category in IRI.
        a. Regarding Gallo transaction, both Co. and Gallo remain committed to completing this transaction.
        b. Receiving positive feedback from FTC staff in addressing the concerns that they raised related to transaction.
           i. Based on Co.'s interactions with FTC, expects a consent decree will be submitted to Commissioners for review and
              approval in coming weeks; this marks the final stage in this process.
          ii. Once final approval is received, closing can happen quickly, which allows to forge ahead with this strategy for wine and
              spirits business.
                                                                                                                                                                             
           3. Strong performance delivered by beer and wine and spirits businesses drove strong cash generation, allowing to further
             reduce debt and progress towards desired leverage range.
            a. Thereby, Co. is well positioned to deliver solid year of organic growth in FY21.
   C. Beer Performance:
      1. Despite challenges posed by COVID-19, including continued partial closure of on-premise which was down 50% YonY, Co.'s
         beer business continues to be one of the largest contributors to US beer industry growth.
      2. Delivered 11% growth in IRI channels overall and more than 15% growth for priority SKUs.
        a. This performance was driven by 12% IRI growth for Modelo Especial, as the brand solidified its position as the Number 3
            beer brand in US beer market, and brand family is on track to deliver its 35th consecutive year of growth.
      3. Corona brand family grew double-digits in IRI channels, with most significant contributions coming from Corona Hard
         Seltzer, Corona Premier and Corona Extra.
      4. Corona Hard Seltzer:
        a. Continues to be thrilled with its performance.
        b. Despite launching this new brand in midst of a pandemic, which presented with and prevented from engaging in a number
            of activities conducive to introducing a new brand, Corona Hard Seltzer has become one of the most successful new
            product launches in Co.'s history.
           i. With launch of only one SKU to date, the brand continues to exceed expectations and has already achieved Number 4
              position in category.
        c. Corona Hard Seltzer is the second fastest moving hard seltzer for those seltzer brands with significant distribution and
            velocity, and it remains strong as Co. continues to pick up distribution.
           i. These ongoing distribution gains have led to IRI ACV distribution approaching 70% since product launch in March, and
              to date, the brand has maintained incrementality levels at 90% rate, significantly [outpacing] expectations.
        d. Corona Hard Seltzer over-indexes to Hispanic consumer relative to its competitors, which unlocks an untapped opportunity
            for this category with fastest growing demographic in the country.
           i. Currently 15-20% of brand volume is estimated to come from Hispanic consumers, while other seltzer brands are closer
              to 10-15%.
        e. Expectations for hard seltzer category growth are extremely high, and Co.'s intention is to become a Top 3 player in hard
            seltzer market, as Co. believes there's a natural and compelling connection between what Corona brand stands for and
            what consumers want in a seltzer, refreshing, great taste [and the flavor and] at zero carbs, zero sugars and only 90 calories.
           i. In future, Co. will expand with new flavors, new packages and even new platforms.
      5. Operationally, continued to engage in constructive conversations with Mexican government as it relates to Co.'s future
         plans for production in Mexico.
        a. Meanwhile, progressing with 5m hectoliter expansion of Obregon facility, which is expected to be completed by FY21-end.
           i. After Obregon capacity expansion completion, Co. believes STZ will have ample capacity at Nava and Obregon breweries
              to meet consumer demand over medium term, which includes more than doubling of seltzer production capacity
              heading into next FY.
   D. Wine & Spirits:
      1. Nearing the finish line with Gallo transaction, which paves way for accelerated growth and margin performance going
         forward.
        a. It aligns with vision for Co.'s business to be a bold and innovative higher-end wine and spirits co. with distinctive brands
            and products delivering exceptional consumer experiences.
      2. Saw staying power of consumer-led premiumization trend with premium price point segments continuing to outpace
         value-priced segments, further reinforcing business strategy.
        a. Higher-end wine Power Brands at greater than $11 retail price point outpaced US high-end wine category in IRI channels,
            driven by Meiomi, Kim Crawford and The Prisoner portfolio, all of which posted double-digit growth in IRI channels.
           i. These trends drove excellent margin performance for business, as price and mix benefits for this higher-end stable of
              brands drove significant margin enhancement.
                                                                                                                                                                             
           3. Throughout remainder of the year, plans to continue to invest in capabilities to position wine and spirits business for
             long-term success.
          4. Innovation pipeline is primed with impactful product introductions, as Co. enters peak seasonal period for the business.
            a. These initiatives are aligned with key consumer macro-trends of betterment, convenience and sustainability that Co.
               believes can drive scale going forward.
          5. Key product launches include The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, SVEDKA and High West
             ready-to-drink cocktails, Ruffino wine spritzer and Meiomi cabernet sauvignon.
            a. These initiatives will be supported throughout remainder of year with impactful marketing campaigns to strengthen and
               build portfolio.
          6. While Co. is already a leading player in three-tier e-commerce, excited about renewed focus on direct-to-consumer space
             with acquisition of Empathy and minority investment in the Booker Vineyard's business, as STZ believes e-commerce,
             including DTC, can become a key growth driver for business.
            a. E-commerce for beverage alcohol has exploded due to pandemic, increasing 3-4 times in volume vs. prior year.
            b. Co. was focused on e-commerce as a growing channel even before COVID and has further accelerated strategy with
               increased resources and focus on digital shelf management, and redeploying marketing dollars to support digital
               e-commerce channels.
   E. Unfortunate Wildfire Situation in West:
      1. All employees are accounted for and safe, and no properties have been impacted by fires.
      2. While Co. is more than 70% through harvest, it is still too early to determine overall impact the fires and resulting smoke
         might have on this year's [vinage].
        a. Performed extensive testing and evaluation.
        b. Has considered a number of potential contingencies and options as Co. progresses through harvest based on STZ's
           perspective at this point.
      3. Committed to providing consumers with same high-quality wine they've come to expect from higher-end brands.
      4. Despite potential impacts from fires, Co. fully expects to be able to meet consumer demand for excellent portfolio of
         products.
   F. Ventures Portfolio:
      1. Last year, announced Co.'s commitment to invest $100m to support African American Black and minority-owned start-ups
         in beverage alcohol space as part of STZ's efforts to enhance diversity and access to opportunity within industry.
        a. Received significant interest in this program to date.
        b. Made good progress over past several years with Co.'s focus on Female Founders initiative, as female-funded and/or
           female-led businesses now account for more than half of ventures portfolio.
        c. Sees an opportunity to make similar progress in supporting African American Black and minority businesses in coming
           years.
      2. Recently acquired a minority stake in Booker Vineyard's business, a super luxury direct-to-consumer-focused wine portfolio,
         to further align wine and spirits business to changing consumer preferences.
        a. Believes this relationship strengthens fine wine portfolio and long-term aspiration to build a strong omni-channel business
           that includes category leadership in DTC and three-tier e-commerce.
      3. Recently acquired remaining interest in Copper & Kings American Brandy Company, which marks Co.'s first full ventures
         acquisition.
        a. Copper & Kings is a cutting-edge distillery that primarily produces highly-differentiated American brandy with a tasting
           room and restaurant located in heart of Bourbon Country and Louisville, Kentucky.
        b. This acquisition allows to play in rapidly-emerging craft spirits market, where premiumization trends remain robust.
      4. Canopy Growth team has made progress in prioritizing their strategic direction to focus on what's needed to become a
         world-class CPG co.
        a. They've identified goals for their core markets, right-sized their footprint, balanced supply and demand needs, improved
           execution and made progress in reducing OpEx and cash burn.
                                                                                                                                                                             
              b. Excited about the successful launch of Rec 2.0 cannabis beverage products in Canadian cannabis market, where Canopy
                 has 75% market share and Top 4 SKUs in category, shipping more than 1.6m cans since launch in March.
                i. For comparison, in calendar year 2019, a total of 4m cans of cannabis beverages were sold in entire US market over
                   course of that year; great progress to date.
             c. Believes that beverages and other Rec 2.0 products will attract new consumers to market and further drive conversion
                 from illicit market.
             d. Earlier today, Canopy Growth announced plans to bring its line of cannabis beverages to US next summer through its
                 revised agreement with Acreage Holdings.
             e. Overall, Canopy remains the best positioned to win long term in emerging cannabis space and is well capitalized to face
                 challenges associated with this current economic environment.
   G. Summary:
      1. Proud of results team has driven in face of continued adversity.
        a. In what was expected to be Co.'s most challenging qtr. of the year, team overcame COVID-related headwinds to deliver
           solid business performance in 2Q.
      2. Beer business continues to be a top growth driver within industry.
        a. Seeing accelerating consumer takeaway trends in IRI channels as Co. works to rebuild inventory position.
      3. Wine and spirit premiumization strategy continues to gain traction.
        a. Co. is in final stages of completing transaction with Gallo, which paves way for accelerated growth and margin performance
           for wine and spirits business going forward.
      4. Performance drove strong cash generation, allowing to further reduce debt and progress towards desired leverage range.
        a. Thereby, Co. is well positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in FY21.
      5. This year marks Co.'s 75th anniversary.
      6. Continued growth and resilience will help ensure Co.'s future remains extremely bright.

II. 2Q21 FINANCIALS (G.H.)

   A. Overview:
      1. Generated strong financial results, despite an uncertain economic environment and headwinds related to COVID-19,
      2. Generated comparable-basis EPS, excluding Canopy growth, of $2.91, continued to deliver strong margins in both beer
         and wine and spirit segments, and increased free cash flow 10%, resulting in ongoing debt repayment and progress in
         achieving targeted leverage.
   B. Note:
      1. Will generally focus on comparable basis financial results.
   C. Beer:
      1. Despite reduced shipment volume related to COVID-19, net sales were flat YoverY.
      2. Excluding Ballast Point divestiture impact, organic net sales increased 1% on organic shipment volume down 1%, which
         was partially offset by favorable pricing.
      3. Depletion volume growth came in at nearly 5%, driven by Modelo Especial and successful launch of Corona Hard Seltzer,
         as strong performance continued in off-premise channel and more than offset impact of nearly 50% YoverY reduction in
         on-premise channel due to COVID-19.
      4. Benefited from one extra sell day.
        a. When adjusted for extra sell day impact, beer business generated approx. 4% depletion volume growth.
           i. [In 3Q], depletion selling days are flat YoverY.
        b. While depletion trends tempered QoverQ due to some out-of-stocks resulting from slowdown in production earlier in FY,
            Co. remains confident in strength of its business as underlying consumer demand remains quite robust.
                                                                                                                                                                             
          5. Making good progress in rebuilding inventory supply across network, both at Co.'s distribution centers and with distributors,
            following production slowdown for roughly two-thirds of 1Q and beginning of 2Q that created out-of-stocks at retail and
            negatively impacted depletions during qtr.
         6. Expects distributor inventory levels to return to more normal levels by 3Q-end, as shipment volume is expected to outpace
            depletion volume during qtr.
         7. GM 55.7%.
           a. Flat YoverY, as favorable pricing and Ballast Point divestiture benefit was offset by unfavorable mix and increased operational
                cost, driven primarily by higher material costs and reduced throughput at Co.'s breweries, resulting in unfavorable fixed
                cost absorption.
         8. Marketing as a percent of net sales 8.4%.
           a. Decreased 70 BP as marketing spend decreased, resulting from COVID-19 related sporting and sponsorship event
                cancellations and/or postponements.
         9. Due to aforementioned factors, beer operating margins increased 70 BP to 42.5%.
        10. Balance of the year:
           a. Plans on taking selective price increases this fall.
               i. Per Co.'s pricing strategy, STZ implements price increases annually on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis,
                  depending on dynamics within a given market.
              ii. This year, Co.'s pricing approach remains intact; timing of price increases could be more staggered throughout 2H of
                  FY, and in some instances, may shift into beginning of FY20.
             iii. For FY21, still expects 1-2% of pricing within Mexican portfolio.
           b. Marketing spend in 1H21 was significantly muted as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 8.6% due to lack of sporting
                and sponsorship events.
               i. During 2H21, committed to an increase in spending behind Co.'s brands, especially by leveraging the return to sports;
                  thereby, expects full-year marketing spend of 9-10% of net sales.
   D. Wine & Spirits:
      1. Power Brand strategy continues to gain momentum as marketplace performance for higher-end Power Brands continues
         to outpace higher-end segment.
        a. As expected, Power Brand depletion volume decelerated, resulting in 1% decline, while overall depletion volume declined
            3%, reflecting the brands to be divested.
      2. To better align with Co.'s strategy for business going forward, STZ did not replicate some lower-return incentive programs
         and pricing initiatives that ran during 2Q20.
      3. Worked to right-size inventory on hand at several chain retailers in key states.
        a. While this drove a negative impact to depletion trends, this will allow to better manage inventories on go-forward basis.
      4. Net sales declined 11% on shipment volume down 19%.
        a. Excluding Black Velvet divestiture impact, organic net sales declined 9%, reflecting shipment volume decline of approx.
            17%, partially offset by robust price and mix benefits.
        b. Net sales results outperformed previously-communicated expectations, primarily due to incremental shipments from the
            brands to be divested, driven by timing of Gallo transaction.
      5. Operating margin 25.9%.
        a. Increased 310 BP, as benefits from price and mix, along with lower marketing spend, were partially offset by higher COGS
            and SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
           i. Higher COGS mostly reflect increased packaging costs including (inaudible) labels, partially offset by lower freight costs.
      6. Experienced continued margin expansion, driven by shipment volume mix, resulting from some of Co.'s fast-moving Power
         Brands, like Kim Crawford, Meiomi and The Prisoner brand family, and favorable pricing for Woodbridge and SVEDKA.
      7. Saw lower promotions as some incentive programing activities did not occur due to current operating environment and
         COVID-19-related closures for on-premise.
      8. Marketing benefit to margin is mostly related to timing, as Co. plans to ship marketing dollars from 1H21 into 2H21 to
         support key marketing and advertising initiatives for Power Brands and innovation launches as STZ enters its peak selling
         season.

                                                                                                                                                                             
          9. Majority of shift will occur in 3Q, resulting in an increase in YoverY spend for qtr.
        10. During Aug., significant wildfires broke out in California, Oregon and Washington State.
           a. Currently monitoring and assessing impact of smoke damage from these wildfires, as Co. progresses through Aug. to Oct.
               harvest season.
           b. At this time, Co. does not expect a material impact to STZ's ability to meet consumer demand.
              i. Expects margins to be impacted as Co. recognizes costs in remainder of FY due to decreased production levels driving
                 unfavorable fixed cost absorption.
             ii. Estimating aforementioned costs of about $25-35m in 3Q21 and $10-15m in 4Q21.
           c. Expects a consent decree will be submitted to Commissioners for review and approval in coming weeks, and therefore,
               expects Gallo and other ancillary deals to close by 3Q-end.
              i. Therefore, expecting reported net sales for wine and spirits to be flattish to prior year in 3Q, while expecting a decline
                 of 20-25% in reported wine and spirits operating income, reflecting negative impact of wildfires and increased marketing
                 expense during qtr.
   E. P&L:
      1. Fiscal YTD corporate expenses came in at approx. $110m.
        a. Up 13% vs. last FY, primarily driven by increased compensation and benefits, unfavorable foreign currency losses and
            increase in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by reduced T&E spend.
      2. Comparable basis interest expense approx. $100m.
        a. Decreased 10%, primarily due to lower avg. borrowings as Co. continued to decrease leverage ratio.
      3. Comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact, came in at 16.9% vs. 15.2% in 2Q20, primarily
         driven by higher effective tax rates on [foreign] businesses, partially offset by increased benefit from stock-based
         compensation.
      4. While pre-COVID estimated full-year FY21 comparable basis effective tax rate, excluding Canopy equity earnings impact,
         was 18%.
        a. Expects rate to approximate 19%.
           i. 1-percentage point rate increase vs. pre-COVID estimate primarily reflects an estimated higher marginal rate on foreign
              earnings.
   F. Free Cash Flow:
      1. Defined as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx.
      2. 1H21 $1.2b.
        a. Represents an impressive 10% increase.
      3. Free cash flow improvement reflects strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx.
   G. CapEx:
      1. Fiscal YTD CapEx totaled $278m or approx. 22% below last year's spend.
        a. Included approx. $200m of beer CapEx, primarily driven by 5m hectoliter expansion project at Obregon Brewery, which
           Co. expects to be completed by FY21-end.
   H. Canopy:
      1. Recognized $48m decrease in fair value of Canopy investments.
        a. These impacts were excluded from comparable basis results.
      2. Total pre-tax net gain recognized since initial Canopy investment in Nov. 2017 is $64m.
      3. In Aug., Canopy reported 1Q21 results.
        a. Pleased with progress that has been made since David Klein took over as CEO in right-sizing business, reducing cash burn
           and improving free cash flow.
        b. Bullish on growth prospects for Canopy Growth, as they continued to execute against their strategic plan.
    I. Outlook:
                                                                                                                                                                             
           1. Given unprecedented COVID-19 events that began to abruptly and dramatically impact consumers and marketplace almost
             concurrently with start of FY and given related uncertainty, volatility and fast-moving developments that have evolved
             during 1H21, Co. still does not believe it is prudent or appropriate to provide formal financial guidance for FY21 at this time.
          2. Reiterating, in a normalized environment, Co.'s medium-term growth algorithm remains unchanged for both beer and wine
             and spirits segments.
    J. Capital Allocation Priorities:
       1. While Co. remains focused on STZ's goal of returning $5b to shareholders in form of dividends and share repurchases
          through FY23, in short term, given volatile environment, STZ remains focused on paying down debt and further reducing
          leverage ratio.
       2. Reduced net debt nearly $600m since FY20-end resulting from strong cash flow generation, while continuing to maintain
          quarterly dividend rate.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Goldman Sachs.

Bonnie Lee Herzog - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I wanted to ask a little bit about the spending that, Garth, you just kind of touched on. A key driver of your strong operating margins
in the quarter really has been a result of lower marketing spend. And now you've talked about your outlook for spending for the full
year being between 9% and 10% as a percentage of sales, which is about 50 bps lower than your previous guidance. So I kind of
wanted to better understand that this is mainly a function of the ongoing pressures from COVID. Or do you see this maybe more as
a realistic run rate going forward in terms of what you're seeing with your depletions and demand for your brands? I guess I'm trying
to get a sense of how you guys are balancing things and really how important it is for you to drive continued margin expansion.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure, Bonnie. Let me take the first part of that, Garth. Our expected run rate is no different going forward than it's ever been. At the
same point, because so much of our live events and sports were delayed in the year, I mean think about the NBA Finals, hockey,
baseball playoffs, many -- football, many of the things that we advertised on were pushed back later in the year, and therefore, into
our third quarter. Some of our spend was also pushed back into those time frames as well. So our intention is to have a consistent
run rate of spend in that 9% to 10% range as we always have, and you will expect to see a little bit more in the third quarter because
many of those pre-bought scenarios will take place during that quarter rather than in the second quarter when we had originally
anticipated they would occur.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes, and the only thing that I would add to that, Bonnie, is from a margin perspective, right, we continue to think that the right range
to think about in terms of our beer margins are at 39% to 40%. Obviously, in any given year, we're going to face headwinds or
tailwinds that are going to fluctuate a little bit. But those are best-in-class margins, and that's the right way to think about the business
on a go-forward basis.

Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC.

Sunil Harshad Modi - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Tobacco, Household Products and Beverages & Lead Consumer
Staples Analyst
So Bill, I just wanted to have a chat on shelf space, right? So you guys have obviously been very active with the shopper first initiative,
ran into a bit of a hiccup with supply/demand. So maybe you can just kind of give us a state of the union on are -- have you lost any
spacing as a result of the out of stocks? Because that has happened in a few categories. So if you could just give us an update there.

And number two, how do you think the retail psychology is evolving as the last 6 months has gone on? Clearly, Constellation has
been under space for a very long time. So I'm just curious like where the retail universe is right now in terms of your actual slot in
the core.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. The -- certainly, the space issue has been somewhat challenging over the very most recent past, simply because of the reduction
in production that we had around COVID-19. With that said, we have seen very little reduction of our overall space as we have spread
out our product mix and our product offering into the existing space that we already had. We're also fortunate that many retailers
have moved their resets and their timing back in the year for the same reason as because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which now
matches up with the time when we're expecting to have our inventory levels back in a more normalized fashion during this quarter.

So we don't see any long-term issue around that. We've been very straightforward with our retail partners about where we are. And
as you well state, our business, if anything, demands more space given the great acceleration that our brands have in the marketplace.
And we expect that over time, we will continue to gain in the distribution area much as we have over the last several years.

Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from Credit Suisse.

Kaumil S. Gajrawala - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - MD & Research Analyst
As it relates to inventories, it looks like kind of year-to-date, you're running with shipments down about 4%, depletions up about
5%, and that's during a seasonal peak period. To get inventories back to where you want them by the end of Q3, what should we
be thinking about in terms of the spread between shipments and depletions?

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So Kaumil, thanks for the question. I'd say that the spread between depletions and shipments is going to top to gauge as we
move through the quarter because it'll largely be dependent upon what depletions look like. And we've actually seen -- as Bill noted,
we've actually seen very strong continued consumer takeaway in IRI, and depletion growth remains very robust.

Suffice that to say, we do know that there will be a dislocation -- not really dislocation, but a difference in between shipments and
depletions for the quarter. How much remains to be seen will be driven by consumer takeaway.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Let me just add to that. I'm sure that you have seen in the most recent 4-week share data that our brands are accelerating as we
bring more and more of them back to the table. I think as Garth points out, that's going to be a big factor in terms of what the balance
is of that. Depletions are certainly accelerating, we're very pleased with that, but it's very tough to give you an exact answer without
knowing how that will land during the course of the quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.

Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So I'm curious, Bill, it sounds like you're very constructive on the momentum that you've established early days on the Corona Hard
Seltzer offering. Curious to hear how you're thinking about positioning a new hard seltzer offering and taking a portfolio approach
to the category.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, we've shipped about 5.5 million cases year-to-date, which is ahead of what we had expected, and we're very excited about it.
As I already said, our velocity against literally one SKU is second in the category. So everything that's occurring around Corona Hard
Seltzer has been sort of positive to what our initial expectations are.

As we already also stated, we're going to be in a position to put additional SKUs into the marketplace next year. We would -- we've
already said also that our capacity would more than double next year. And keep in mind, we have a minority investment in PRESS,
which we're very excited about. PRESS has performed exceedingly well. And as we've said in prior calls, we do expect some price
stratification to occur over time in the seltzer category. So PRESS is very positive.

We've also done some very limited regional things like Funky Buddha in Florida. In Florida, that particular brand is in the top 5 of all
seltzers in the state of Florida. So we've got our toes in the water on a number of areas. Corona Hard Seltzer will continue to be our
lead, but we certainly have other opportunities to continue to gain share in what is becoming a very important subsegment of the
beer business.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.

Bryan Douglass Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD of Equity Research
Garth, I just wanted to follow up on the incremental costs in the wine segment. So I guess 2 questions related to it. First are the costs
that you highlighted, are they relevant to the -- or related to the ongoing business, so separate from the piece that's going off in the
divestiture to Gallo?

And then second, I guess trying to understand if this at all impacts kind of the timing or the cadence of supply chain for the wine
business going into next year. And I guess what I'm trying -- I'm thinking of it is, are you -- is there a delay in terms of pressing grapes
and putting juice in the tanks? Is there a delay in pulling product out of the tank and bottling? I'm just really just trying to understand
if there's going to be any kind of disruption in the flow of the supply chain in wine that might lead into next year.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 
Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Bryan, thanks for the question. So the costs, as I outlined them, are for the remaining business, for the business that we are
retaining, not for what we're divesting to Gallo. And as it relates to the question on supply chain, we don't expect there to be any
material impact on our ability to meet consumer demand as we go forward. We have lots of flexibility in how we source grapes and
fruit, whether that's through the bulk line market, the bulk line that we have on hand, our own vineyards, relationships we have with
other growers. We don't see any impact on our ability to meet consumer takeaway.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.

Dara Warren Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD
So Bill, you mentioned your aspiration to be a top 3 player in the seltzer category -- hard seltzer category longer term. Obviously,
you just touched on some of the new SKUs that you have planned. But can you also give us a sense for how important new platforms
will be in that aspiration long term in terms of becoming a top 3 player? And is that more of a longer-term focus? Or could we see a
big push behind new entries of brands in the hard seltzer more near term?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, certainly, Corona Hard Seltzer will be our primary approach to this category. As we stated, given our roughly $10 million
capability for this year, we've relied on one -- literally one SKU. So as we go forward and we expand and finish the Obregon expansion
that I discussed earlier, that gives us the opportunity to extend our reach within the Corona Hard Seltzer franchise.

We're a big believer that Corona is the perfect brand to maintain our lead focus for seltzer because it meets up exactly with the whole
brand essence of refreshment, relaxation and finding your beach. So it -- that will continue to be the lead play for us, but we're always
exploring what consumers are interested in going forward. And yes, we do have some additional things that we'll be talking to you
about in future conference calls as to what we expect to do during the next fiscal year.

Our next question comes from the line of Sean King from UBS.

Sean Roberts King - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Equity Research Analyst of Beverages
Yes, I wanted to dig a little bit more into what you're seeing in the month of September. I know you mentioned like based on the IRI
data that we're seeing a gradual acceleration as you're getting more on the shelves, but in terms of the on-premise that you're seeing
there would be helpful. And what I've been hearing is that there's fewer taps at most of the outlets that are open, if that's a potential
headwind or a benefit for your portfolio.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. As you know, we are somewhat less susceptible to the on-premise versus much of the competition with our brands. With that
said, there's -- we had 50% closure in the second quarter. We had 75% in the first, and it's looking more and more like that will also
reduce another 15% to 20% during the third quarter if things continue as they're going.

With that said, admittedly, the quarter -- I mean, excuse me, the month literally ended yesterday, so we're still adding it up. But it
certainly looks like we're going to have a significantly better depletion month in September than we have year-to-date. In fact, it
could quite well be our best month of the year so far. That matches up entirely with the acceleration that you've seen in IRI data over
the last 4 weeks, which has been accelerating and returned us to a gaining share position, which is something we've normally seen
in our business over the course of time.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.

Kevin Michael Grundy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior VP & Equity Analyst
Great. This is building on Nik's question earlier. This is for you, Bill. Just the outlook for the Modelo brand looking out over the next
few years and kind of pass some of the near-term volatility related to COVID comes up frequently with investors, understandably
given the importance of the brands to your outlook. So could you comment on your ability to grow volumes in that business double
digits over the next few years? As we look at the Nielsen channels, ACV is less of an opportunity. But as was pointed out, shelf space
is an opportunity. So maybe comment on that a bit, talk a little bit about the interplay and your ability to drive that kind of growth,
the interplay between Modelo with the Corona brand. And then just lastly, perhaps touch on, is it in the consideration sector that
you would extend the Modelo brand into seltzers as well?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. As we've said, Modelo is one of the chief growth drivers of our beer business. Modelo Especial has become the #3 beer brand
in the U.S. market, and it continues to accelerate, part of -- it does that for a number of reasons. One is it continues to have a
disproportionate SKU in the Hispanic community, which is a growing demographic in the United States, but we've also radically
extended that into the non-Hispanic community. Jim Sabia has been advertising to the non-Hispanic community only for the last
few years. So this is relatively new that we've been expanding the reach, particularly in Modelo Especial.

As you know, our Chelada introductions have gone extremely well, one after the next. And certainly, it's continued to see growth in
Negra as well. So the overall family is very healthy. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're looking at the 35th consecutive year of
growth for that brand. And quite honestly, I don't know how high is up. I think there's -- there remains tremendous opportunity to
extend that franchise, both with its core Hispanic community as well as the non-Hispanic marketplace into which we've started to
advertise.

I highly doubt that we will do a seltzer under that brand. We believe that the core essence of that brand focuses much more on full
flavored beer. And any innovation that we might approach on that particular brand will follow more of the brand essence of the
Modelo brand rather than what we have done with Corona, where we feel the whole refreshment platform matches up perfectly
with the hard seltzer subsegment.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan.

Andrea Faria Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
So I wanted to go back to the depletions commentary. I understand there are obviously a lot of puts and takes, but you sounded
optimistic. So Bill, are you running in the mid-single digits as you alluded to before or even at the high single digits for beer depletions
in September?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, as I said earlier, and I'll maintain that thought given we have not even gotten all the numbers in yet, and therefore, Garth has
not added them all up. But it appears that September will be significantly better than what our year-to-date has been. And as I said,
it very likely will be our single best month of the year.

So we continue to be optimistic that what we've seen on takeout and IRI trends that have occurred over the last 4 weeks is currently
being reflected in our increased depletion trend that we're seeing in September, which again matches up with our expectation given
we have been back operating at normal levels within the plant now for a significant period of time.

So again, it's a little difficult to put an exact number on it right at this point, but it certainly looks like September was a very, very
positive month.

Andrea Faria Teixeira - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - MD
And if I can squeeze -- that's helpful, Bill. If I can squeeze just a margin question. I know it's like you just quoted some of the expenses
that are -- I mean, obviously, the COVID expenses. Other than those, like which may or may not recur as we lap next year, are we
looking at obviously a better outlook now that production is when -- it's where it should be and you're reaching back to the production
and you're getting obviously economies of scale and you're getting your seltzer volumes like as you quoted better than anticipated?
Should we see a progression in like long-term outlook for margins to continue to build or you're going to have to invest more into
the pricing? The pricing commentary obviously is going to last, but you're going to increase the pricing through the beginning of
fiscal -- we could go into fiscal, but I'm just thinking of the puts and takes of FX and volumes coming back, how we should be thinking
about margins going forward.

Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So margins for our beer business going forward, as we said earlier, the right range to think about them is, as we said previously,
which is that 39% to 40% range, right, again, best-in-class margins. In any given year, we're going to have puts and takes as it relates
to margins. We're going to get the benefits of our pricing, but we're also going to face headwinds around things like incremental
depreciation that flows through cost of goods as well as we build and add capacity, we'll have periods where we have lower utilization
rates, which can -- which will have a drag. And so as we say, there's always going to be these puts and takes in any given year, but
39% to 40% is the right way to think about our margin profile over the medium term.

And on the seltzer point that you raised, seltzer currently is a drag given the additional flavors and some of the co-packing that needs
to be done there. As we progress and as we get to be -- have more scale in seltzer, there'll definitely be margin improvement there,
and we'll start to get closer in line with Corona Extra glass. But again, even as margins improve on seltzer, that there will be other
puts and takes. So 39% to 40% is the right way to think about it.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein from Evercore.

Robert Edward Ottenstein - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD, Head of Global Beverages Research
& Fundamental Research Analyst
Bill, I just want to kind of step back and ask you a big picture question that you're probably in a better position to answer than
anybody else. And that is at least based on the data we get, and for spirits, it's not that good, but even with the tremendous boost
that the beer industry has gotten from hard seltzers, it looks like spirits are gaining share of throat and that maybe even have
accelerated this year. And based on what you see, is that, in fact, true? And what do you account for that? Is it the out of stocks for
beer? Or is there something -- due to the COVID environment that favors spirits? And if these trends look like they're going to continue,
are you thinking just in terms of your long-term capital allocation to pivot more towards spirits? I know you just made a spirits
acquisition. But just how are you thinking about that dynamic?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Sure, Rob. It's very difficult in a COVID year to make lots of predictions about what will be sustainable and what will maintain itself
once we come out of the COVID scenario and what won't. I do think it's very fair to say there will be some fundamental change. Some
of that fundamental change will be about 3 tier e-commerce and direct-to-consumer, things that we're investing a lot of our energy
and focus on going forward. So I wouldn't make a lot of prediction as to what the adjustments that could occur between spirits or
beer or wine.

What I would say is we have worked aggressively, as you've seen, to make sure that our portfolio is positioned for where the consumer
is going, not where the consumer has been. We've invested in craft spirits, which we think has tremendous upside. Our beer business
plays in the high end, which is where the growth in the category is. We're extending our capabilities in seltzer to more than double
what we have done in this fiscal year going forward. And our wine business is tremendously positioned to continue to leverage the
premiumization trend that's going on. In addition to that, we're doing the kinds of innovations that the consumer is looking for in
things like betterment and convenience. You're seeing that in some of the new products that we've talked about this year.

That's where our focus really lies, and I think there's tremendous opportunity within our portfolio no matter how it shakes out
post-COVID. As I said, I do think there will be some fundamental change about how the consumer buys. And to some degree, there
almost has to be because there has been a significant shift from the on-premise to the off-premise. And I think that the long-term
trend of that, I still think, is too early to predict.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from Truist Securities.

Grant Blandford O'Brien - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Associate
This is Grant on for Bill. Just had one on the wine and spirits power brand's depletion growth this quarter. I was just hoping, Garth,
you give a bridge on some of those impacts you walked through the inventory changes at the distributor level and the promotional
changes. Just trying to get an underlying growth number for that business.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Garth Hankinson - Constellation Brands, Inc. - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. The -- I think the question is that you want to understand sort of like why the power brand growth wasn't higher than you were
expecting, and that really is because we did do -- we didn't repeat some non-return generating promotional activity or take some
non-enhancing -- non-value-enhancing pricing actions. And we also cleaned up or reduced the number of days outstanding with
some key retailers. So the underlying brands are strong as you see in the IRI takeaway, and the reduction or a slowdown in depletions
really is just -- is doing a little bit of house cleaning, so to speak.

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Keep in mind, Bill, if I could add -- just to add to Garth's comment, our high-end over $11 power brands continue to outpace
their competition, and that's led by Meiomi and the Prisoner family, Kim Crawford. These brands are accelerating in the minds of
consumer.

Keep in mind, going back to sort of Robert's question from a minute ago, one of the things that we continue to see is people are
attracted to try and true brands. And we are very fortunate when you talk about our beer business or our wine business or our spirit
business to have a lot of those brands that are inherently trusted, and that has been extremely helpful for us during the pandemic.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet from Guggenheim.

Laurent Daniel Grandet - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Analyst and MD of the Consumer & Retail Team
Another question on seltzer. With the launch of Topo Chico seltzer next year, there will be more competition to attract Hispanic
consumers into the seltzer category potentially from beer. So first, I mean do you see Topo Chico seltzer as a risk for your core Mexican
beer business? And second, what are your plan with Corona seltzer to increase Hispanic penetration that seems to be low by your
account?

William A. Newlands - Constellation Brands, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, as I said earlier, we have been very pleased by the development of our Corona Hard Seltzer business with the Hispanic community.
It's indexing somewhere between 5 and 10 points greater than the overall category, and we think that speaks very well to broadening
the reach of the seltzer subsegment with consumers. So we're very positive about that.

As I'm sure you've seen, there's been a lot of introductions in the seltzer category, but consumers have a tendency to go with tried
and true, trusted brands. And there is really no stronger brand that's trusted in the minds of consumers than Corona. And certainly,
Corona Hard Seltzer will fall into that ZIP code as well. So we always wish well for our competition, but we'll be quite happy to do
our bit, and we'll see how it all falls out.

Thanks, Jonathan. So thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. Despite the continued and unprecedented challenges that
have occurred since the beginning of our fiscal year, our team continues to remain agile and have overcome massive headwinds to
deliver strong business performance in the first half of our fiscal year. We remain confident in the resiliency of our business.

Our beer business, as we've discussed today, continues to be a top growth driver within the industry, while our wine and spirit
premiumization strategy continues to gain momentum, especially as we enter the final stages of completing our transaction with
Gallo. We remain bullish on the future performance of our powerful collection of consumer connected brands, and we are well
positioned to deliver a solid year of organic growth in fiscal '21.

Our next quarterly call is scheduled for early January. So I'm wishing everyone at this point a safe and happy holiday season, and I'm
also reminding you to enjoy some of our great products during your socially-distant celebrations with your family and friends.

PRESENTATION
Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking some time out of your day to join us. We hope you'll find this webinar informative. My name is Jeremy
Hellman, I'm with the Equity Group, and we serve as Limbach's external investor relations consultants.

Our goal here today is to provide an introduction to the company for investors that are less familiar with Limbach. With that in mind, we'll be
focusing on higher-level concepts such as the nonresidential construction industry, where Limbach fits into that ecosystem and how we intend to
capitalize on the opportunities that we see.

We'll be using a slide presentation as part of this webinar, and a copy of that can also be found in the Investor Relations section of the company's
website at www.limbachinc.com. As always, the company encourages everyone to review the forward-looking statement disclosure on Slide 2 of
the presentation.

Before we get into the presentation, I just want to review a couple of procedural items. We'll have everyone muted throughout the event and do
our best to continue keeping everyone muted. And after the presentation, we look forward to taking your questions (Operator Instructions).

I'll do my best to aggregate similar questions and will verbally direct the questions to management. Lastly, if you have a question that we can't get
to or which requires further discussion, please don't hesitate to reach out to either myself or Matt Katz. Contact info for both of us is on Slide 20 of
the presentation.

Joining us today from Limbach are Charlie Bacon, the President and Chief Executive Officer; Jayme Brooks, the company's Chief Financial Officer;
and Executive Vice President, Matt Katz. With that, I'll hand it off to Charlie.

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First off today, as Jeremy just touched on, perhaps some people have been following
us for a while, perhaps there's some new interested parties. But give you an overview of who we are, what we do, our strategies we're deploying
over the next 24 to 36 months, and we look forward to Q&A. But the goal really is to just educate folks to learn more about our company, where
we're going and what we're doing. And I think there's some pretty exciting times in front of us.

So I'm going to provide a bit of an overview on the nonresidential market, how I'm seeing some things. We'll get into our business operations, the
strategy, the goals that we're setting out for ourselves and the longer-term outlook. The thing that I do want to reinforce to everybody, we're not
going to be providing any additional information on financials today. We provided that information obviously at the end of our second quarter,
recently at the LD Micro Conference and at the D.A. Davidson Conference. And of course, we're wrapping up Q3, and we'll be reporting our results
as we need to in the future, very near future.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So with that said, I'm going to move to our deck and just bear with me a moment. Okay, here we are. So -- by the way, it's interesting, I do these
earnings calls and we have scripts. Today, I'm not really using a script, although I have one. I'm really going to just share our company, who we are
and you're just going to get to hear our direction, which is really important.

I'm going to spend a few minutes on this cover slide because I think it's very important to convey to everybody a lot of details about our company.
So first off, our brand. Limbach has been around for over approximately 120 years. We're extremely well known in the industry. So most people,
especially on the general contractor or construction manager front know us quite well. And many, many building owners, we have over 1,100
relationships with building owners throughout the country.

What we do is we do mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems in buildings and that includes building automation and building controls. And
I'm going to get a little bit into some more detail in some later slides about the specific services, but there's a couple of words that we have on this
cover slide that I think are very important for all of you to understand: diverse, and essential.

Let me start with diverse. So when you look at our sectors, which you see them across the screen there, we're not into one sector, very focused,
where if a sector goes south, it could cause havoc. In fact, Limbach has a very diverse resume, which allows us to deal with an economic downturn
in a particular market. We can shift human capital and our resources to other sectors.

And in fact, we're seeing that today. So when you look at our sectors, healthcare is doing well along with life sciences, which we include in healthcare,
basically talking about research and development, and you can imagine what the pharmaceuticals and biotechs are doing right now. So that's a
very busy market for us.

Education, while it's -- the big capital projects are kind of on the back burner, there's a lot of opportunity for us, which we have seen to get the
buildings back up and running as campuses and local school districts figure out how to get students back into their buildings.

Government, there's still spend on especially at the federal level, and we continue to capture market share there. Mission-critical, pretty much data
centers, very busy in that sector. Don't see any let up, especially with the virtual world we're living in.

And the one that I find interesting is all the way on the right-hand side, industrial manufacturing. While we're engaged in that sector, it's not a
major focus for us, but we're watching the anti-China sentiment and the onshoring discussions that are going on. We think that could be a very
important play for us in the future.

In terms of essential, the other word I want to reference, what we learned through the whole COVID situation here from March on, we're needed.
Humans need what we do: HVAC, water, power in buildings. I mean, it's a human essential today. So we found that while we saw a bit of contraction
in the early months of April and May into June in several of our geographies, all of that has opened back up. We didn't realize any cancellations in
any of our backlog, and we're continuing on all of our construction sites today.

And in terms of our service work that we do where we maintain buildings, that is back to normal at this point. And in fact, during the height of the
COVID scare in the early days, we actually generated quite a bit of emergency work, including converting the convention center into 250 hospital
beds in 10 days. So we're essential, which is terrific for our business.

And just some other comments: In terms of market activity, I could get into pipeline and perhaps during Q&A if anybody would like to ask me some
questions, we'll do that, respond. But generally, when you look at our sphere of business, the nonresidential civil construction business in the United
States is about a $525 billion market. And right now, while there was some contraction with COVID impacts, we're actually seeing an uptick again
in activity where -- again, we're essential, so we never really stopped, but there has been some concern about our pipeline and what's going to be
happening.

But in fact, we're starting to see the architects become busy again. It's kind of interesting. It's almost like a stock market when the stock market's
facing that I guess is a V-shaped recovery, at least in the stock market, and perhaps in the economy. But in our industry, we're starting to see a
bounce-back in a number of sectors. A key measure for us that we watch closely is the American Institute of Architects' Billing Index. And back in

                                                                                                                                                                             
 March, it dropped to 33. Anything over 50 means they're expanding. Obviously anything under 50 means contraction. But in March, they hit 33.
Their billings went down dramatically.

They're bouncing back; July and August, they're back up at 40. And the other telling sign, though, the architects also have another key measure of
design contracts, meaning they're starting to see some new work come in, get under contract. And that was down at 27 back in March, which is
obviously a very low number. That's now bounced back to 46. So you can see the trend upward for the architects, which means business for us, 12
to 19 months down the road, and specifically around the construction segment of our business.

So I wanted to provide a bit of an overview of Limbach's strong brand, what we do, MEP in buildings, the living breathing systems of buildings; the
diversity of our business, how essential we are and obviously some comments about the market starting to bounce back in terms of post-COVID.
I shouldn't say post-COVID, but I guess, now the COVID -- the new normal and what we're dealing with.

Here's the forward-looking statements. Jeremy Hellman already mentioned this, so I'm not going to get into more of that, but I think everybody is
quite clear on our statements here today and what they mean by this statement.

But moving on, so a little bit more about what we do. So when you look at this graphic here, again, our industry is $525 billion here in the United
States. And you can see all the different components there that make up the industry in terms of how things get designed and built. So you have
the building owner. Obviously they're the ones with the capital. They're looking to deploy it, build something, some sort of investments, some sort
of asset.

They typically go and retain an architect, which may include engineering component with it. But typically, the owner and the architect work together
to start defining the needs and the design of the facility. And they'll work closely together. The architect will provide some -- hold on a second,
sorry. They'll actually define need and start coming up with the concepts of design along with budgets. Engineers continue what the architect
started by designing structural systems.

And then you have the building systems, the mechanical, the electrical, the plumbing. And eventually, a general contractor is brought onboard.
Sometimes they're brought on very early, but typically not. At some point, they're brought onboard and they start doing refined budgeting. And
the result of that budgeting typically leads to projects being over budget. The owners are kind of upset, what's going on, and at that point, a general
contractor reaches out to a firm like Limbach, and we start helping them getting it back into the budget.

So that's where we come into play as a specialty contractor. And then you have -- and then right after the building is built, you have the service
and maintenance, which we love because that creates the annuity income stream. What you see there are those green boxes to the right, specialty
contractors, service and maintenance, that's where Limbach plugs in.

What you're going to hear us talk about today specifically is our target is to constantly move to the left to get to that building owner with our
services. And we're going to explain how that's a core part of the strategy going forward, which will create very nice...

(technical difficulty)

Please mute out if you can. Thank you very much.

All right. So Limbach's business and operations, this graphic really displays all the things that we do.

(technical difficulty)

Please, I'd ask everybody to mute your phones. Thank you.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 So what you see here is the complete assembly of what we do. In the center, I'm going to actually start in the center, where you see construction
and installation. The fact of the matter is there are hundreds and thousands of mechanical contractors out there. Limbach happens to be 1 of the
top 10 in the nation. But we build buildings all the time.

Now with the separation of Limbach, what makes us so different is on the left. So you see engineering and energy modeling. We have our own
in-house engineering group, which works very closely with the general contractors and owners to maintain budgets, to maintain the design and
also to be looking at the life cycle costing of a building. And we'll do the 3D modeling and the fancy assembly of drawings, making sure it's all going
to fit. Eventually, we'll do some modular construction. And I'm going to touch on modular in a few moments, how important that is to our industry
in the future.

But we'll build it. And eventually, all the way on the right-hand side is the maintaining of the building. And that creates the annuity income stream
and that's where Limbach typically starts its relationship, a very strong relationship with the building owner. But what I want to point out to
everybody, and this is the differentiating factor for Limbach, owners are getting smarter about the process. When they realize they're over budget,
the general contractor calls us in to start getting the project back into budget. Owners are starting to realize, why don't we have Limbach in upfront?

Why is it that the MEP systems that cost anywhere from 25% to 50% of the cost of the new building -- why did we bring them in so late only to lose
time and it cost money to get it back into budget? Why don't we have them come in early, establish the budget and stay with that budget through
the course of the project, not lose time and not have the extra expense?

So we're seeing a lot of owners like Hospital Corporation of America, Disney, just to name a couple, that bring us in now early upfront to help them
with their budgeting and design, so that they don't face that hiccup that happens just about on every project. It's a huge differentiating factor for
us.

As far as the diversity of our business, I've mentioned the end markets, there's no heavy focus in any particular market, although healthcare and
life sciences is a big part of our business and we're excited about how we've positioned our company to deal with the current economic situation
and the impacts of the virus. We're well, well-positioned. But our geography, we operate out of 13 different facilities. We actually service over 24
different major cities out of those facilities.

And the thing I want to point out about the map on the U.S., you can obviously see there's some prime areas of geography that we're looking at
as future growth potential, namely the Southeast between the Mid-Atlantic down through Florida and then also the greater Texas midpoint of this
-- of the country that we see tremendous opportunity for growth. So we're looking at those markets for future expansion.

Our service offering, I just touched on that. And the customer base, again, we work for building owners and we work for general contractors. We
have excellent relationships with all the major, major general contractors in the United States. And of course, building owners, we work with some
of the top spenders in the United States, and we're looking to rapidly expand that.

(technical difficulty)

Please mute your phone. Thank you. I apologize for that. Anyway, please mute your phones.

So the customer base, we have over 1,100 direct-to-owner relationships throughout the U.S., and we're looking to continue to expand that as well
as leverage those relationships into further market share, market spend.

So our strategic goals -- so current year into next year, we're going to be looking at the issue of risk management paradigm. Two years ago, we
actually oversold the capacity of the business to deliver and that cost us...

(technical difficulty)

Please mute. Thank you. Okay.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 (technical difficulty)

Folks, I'm not sure what's going on there. It sounds like we've been hacked. We're going to -- hold on one moment, please.

(technical difficulty)

All right, folks. We're going to continue on. If we continue to have a problem, we're probably going to have to end this. It appears someone's hacked
us somehow. I'm not sure how that happens. Anyway, I'll continue.

So in terms of redefining risk management, a couple of years ago, we oversold the capacity of the business with a couple of our locations and that
cost us dearly. What we did over 2 years ago was we set new risk management processes in place, I'm going to touch on that in a moment. From
the standpoint of liquidity and cash flow, we're very, very focused on how we generate our cash in setting up our projects, we want to touch on
that.

And finally, you're hearing a theme here, how we want to expand our owner-direct services, and we're going to touch on how that's coming
together. It's pretty exciting how we're starting to see that evolve. And actually, over the past number of years, we've seen some rapid growth with
our owner-direct services and we expect that to continue.

So when we turn around and look at risk management, in terms of our project selection, we've put quite a few processes in place over the past
couple of years to make sure we're taking on the appropriate projects tied to our resources. And what we're doing today is we're leveraging the
great talent that resides here at Limbach. We're only taking on projects tied to the availability of our resources, and we're looking to maximize our
returns both in terms of margin as well as improving cash flow.

We've actually set up a Risk Management Review Committee over 18 months ago. Any project over $7.5 million has to go through that Risk Review
Committee, which is a standing committee every Friday morning and each of our business units have to present their projects. Occasionally, we
say no to a project now. And also in terms of risk profile, we look at our margin returns and the -- and we are looking...

(technical difficulty)

All right. This is horrible.

What we're going to be -- what we're doing is we're looking at the return on our labor and maximizing that. So we're actually increasing margin
on a number of our projects when we're in pursuit and if we don't win them, that's okay, we're actually going to be very focused on cherry-picking
the opportunities for the company.

We're also looking at smaller projects. We see a tremendous return both in profit and better cash flow on the shorter-duration, smaller projects.
And that's really paid off well. Our portfolio of larger projects is coming down. Now having said that, we are still pursuing larger projects in the
markets where we have a proven capacity to execute the larger-scale projects with customers we trust.

So today, we still continue to do quite well. An example would be up in Michigan. We finished the Detroit Red Wings Entertainment Complex a
couple of years ago that was over $130 million of value. And so we're continuing to have an appetite for taking on larger-scale projects, we have
a great reputation in the Greater Detroit area for that. And -- but as an example, we're only going to be taking on the larger projects where we have
the capacity, the competent teams and also have a very trusting commercial relationship with the general contractor as well as having a relationship
with the building owner.

We're also looking to expand our modular construction. We've had great success throughout, I guess the past number of years, I mean almost 10
years now that we started doing multi-trade racks and I've shared this with our investor pool in the past. But quickly, if you think about building a
hospital building, of which we've built many, if you opened up the corridor ceilings, you would see just a mass of pipe conduit, ductwork, control
wiring.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 And what we're doing today is we're actually manufacturing those assemblies in our fabrication facilities and then shipping them out to the job
sites. Typically, a corridor would take a couple of months to build. We can now actually build a corridor in the course of a week, actually several
days, once we get the repetition down on a particular project, saving a great amount of time, great amount of labor, less risk, safer conditions and
that's a way of the future. We actually believe we can get to the potential where 90% of what we do can be prefabricated and shipped out to job
sites and erected. So we're going to continue to focus on that issue of modular construction.

In terms of maximizing profit and cash flow, our second-quarter results are clearly with profit, clearly with cash flow. We're doing a much better
job. In terms of risk-adjusted pricing, I just mentioned the risk review committee. We had one opportunity presented to us by a team, and it was
going out on a certain margin. And when we looked at it, we increased the margin by about 20% and the business unit manager was a bit concerned
he wouldn't be able to secure the deal, but we insisted, you have to. And in fact, we did win that particular project and that opened up the eyes of
that particular manager, we can do much better in that marketplace.

So we continue to look at the risk on a project and make sure we have adequate coverage on the margin. And also where can we, quite frankly,
jump the margin up for additional return. So we're having pretty good success there. The working capital, it's a matter of setting up the projects
properly and preselling cash flow.

On the claims, the company, as reported in our earnings release, we have over $40 million in disputed change orders and claims on certain projects
that were delayed not due to our fault, and we're pursuing financial recovery. Each one of those are being worked aggressively, and we expect to
see those resolved over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, it takes time to get them resolved. But we expect that will lead to a further cash infusion
into the company, once resolved.

We're rationalizing all of our SG&A. With the COVID crisis, we did reduce headcount by approximately 18% in the salaried workforce. Some of those
folks have come back now that the company is back 100% operating after some shutdowns. But actually, many positions weren't brought back,
and in fact, they won't be brought back. So we're operating, I think, with a smarter workforce; that's helping us with our bottom line. And again,
we're continuing to rationalize all of our SG&A.

And finally, consistent execution. A couple of years ago, we oversold capacity. That's not happening today based on all the risk management
processes we have in place, but we also have put in place additional oversight resources to make sure we're executing the Limbach way and that's
working and clearly that's coming through our results.

In terms of the owner-direct expansion, you can see a number of points on the slide there. MEP Prime is where we're acting actually as the general
contractor. Now these are heavy mechanical, electrical, plumbing projects. The majority of the work are within those building trades. But if there's
a little bit of concrete, a little bit of steel, some paint, wallpaper, stuff like that, we can include that. In fact, we hire a general contractor to work
under our contract to do that. But the bulk of the work is MEP. We're having great success with that, and we're looking to continue the expansion
of that service offering.

We've had some interesting success working out of market by providing a construction management service by teaming up with a local mechanical
contractor. We did a great hospital project in Toledo, Ohio. It was a terrific outcome for the company. Client was thrilled and we're looking to repeat
that success with that offering, where we actually don't provide any labor, but we're providing a professional management service, either with a
local contractor or perhaps it's just more of a program management type role, helping the owner and the general contractor deliver a hospital in
a market where we don't have a presence.

Building controls offering -- we actually have a relationship with Johnson Controls nationally. We've always had building controls, but we see a
great opportunity to expand that even more. That leads to additional maintenance-type contracts with the owners, so we're rapidly expanding
building controls and building automation.

The technology offering expansion includes items such as predictive analytics, asset management, basically cataloging all of the equipment in a
building and helping customers understand how to manage their capital for improvements and maintenance. And then you also have the energy
                                                                                                                                                                             
 components. We're seeing some tremendous opportunities to deploy new technologies, and in fact, they're already happening. But we're investigating
other technologies we can deploy going forward.

Now as far as the traditional relationship, we kind of painted a picture earlier about how it all works. But when you look at where the general
contractor lies, the subcontractors that work for the general contractor, our goal here is to really continue the development of our relationship
with building owners. I mentioned Disney, HCA, another major customer of ours is actually in Detroit, Bedrock, which is a development arm of Dan
Gilbert's empire coming off of Quicken Loans. He's redeveloping Detroit.

We're a big part of that, and we're offering our services directly to Bedrock as well as through general contractors to help rebuild. But they're doing
what I said earlier, we're helping them with their budgets, their design, keeping things in check, maintaining their budgets so they can get their
buildings built for the numbers that they agreed upon upfront and not have problems later.

So a lot of owners are coming to us to help them with their capital investments, their business assets, and we're actually becoming more of a
solution provider where we're listening to their needs and what they're trying to achieve in their business and then developing that relationship
for the long-term, helping them figure out the construction sequencing and eventually the operations of their buildings from an MEP perspective.

The engineering group that you see down at the bottom -- that's our hallmark, to refer to as Limbach Engineering & Design Services, LEDS, a terrific
group of people, very knowledgeable. What's interesting, there are a plenty of engineering firms out there. But there aren't many engineering firms
that actually build. So when you combine the knowledge of the builder, the engineer together, and basically, what you can think about is kind of
a white collar knowledge of engineering, then you take the tacit knowledge of being a builder, meaning right in the field, a foreman. You bring
that together, it's a very powerful combination that allows a building owner to get an optimum solution for their building MEP systems. And that's
what we provide. And we think we have a great opportunity to leverage that into a very, very smart play for the future.

So if you look at our business plan 5 years out, it really is the further integration with the building owner that we're looking to achieve. Today, a
building owner and relationships and the services we provide, a lot of it has to do with preventative maintenance, emergency and spot work, small
projects, but you can see up on the upper right, the building controls and automation, we see a tremendous opportunity for rapid growth with
that.

And then down at the bottom, I've touched on this already, but these different services we can provide -- we're doing a bit of this here and there,
but we see an opportunity to rapidly expand each of these services, and that will be both organic as well as looking at different acquisition-type
opportunities to get us closer to the owner. So I'm not going to get into a deep conversation about our future around acquisitions. But rest assured,
as we go forward, it will be tied to how can we get closer to the owner. It probably will not be looking at acquiring more of a traditional mechanical,
electrical construction company. It's going to be more the front-end services, the commissioning services, the energy-related services, all of those
types of components to continue our rapid growth.

The other thing I do want to share with everybody is when we look at our traditional general contractor-construction manager relationship, which
represents 80% of our revenue today, we expect that to continue to see modest-to-slight growth, not rapid growth. That's not our focus. We want
to see rapid growth with the owner-direct relationship. That's much better cash flow, much better margins. On the GC and construction manager
side, we're going to be cherry-picking what we go after.

So we have great relationships, great brand, we have terrific engineering, we have terrific builders in our organization. We're going to leverage the
resources that we have and maximize our outcome on the GC/CM side, and we're just going to be very, very selective. But on the owner-direct, or
ODS as we refer to it as an acronym, we see rapid growth. And again, that will be both organic as well as looking at acquisition opportunities to
continue that growth.

In terms of our guidance we've given to the marketplace, like I have already mentioned, I'm not going to get into financials today. We'll be releasing
our third quarter earnings in due course. But from the standpoint of guidance, we're looking at between $560 million and $600 million of revenue
and adjusted EBITDA between $22 million and $24 million for this fiscal year.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In terms of our liquidity and debt obligations, this slide just gives you a snapshot of where we were as of July 31. You can see a continued improvement
on our cash position and overall liquidity. And I might -- I'm just going to make a comment here. During the early days of the coronavirus and
COVID-19 crisis, we actually looked at backing off our strategic plan a little bit, get very tactical. And I came up last week of March with 3 areas of
focus: stay safe, get cash, get work. And we had daily management calls on those 3 areas of focus. We absolutely stayed safe. We did extremely
well, very few impacts of COVID-19 on our company, meaning on our employees. And then get cash, obviously dramatic improvement. So get
cash, that's not going away. We're going to keep that front and center.

In terms of get work, we had weekly calls every Tuesday afternoon at 4:30 with our complete sales force to constantly think through where were
the opportunities that the virus was creating and how to deal with our existing customer base to help them, basic -- reaching out to the customers
and saying, hello, that played out through the earnings. And obviously here with liquidity and cash, the get cash part really worked out well, and
we're not backing off that. I think that's really worked out well.

A quick comment on our debt. We have some very expensive debt that we're working our way through. I will share with everybody, we are
laser-focused on working our way out of that and getting to a more normalized facility. I can't comment any further, but that is a huge focus of
management right now.

In terms of valuation considerations, I think we're clearly discounted to our competitors out there. They are much larger than us in terms of revenue
and what they're doing. We think over the course of some time, we're going to catch up and do quite well. But I believe when I look at where we're
at as a company, we are undervalued. We're seeing obviously some good appreciation in the market over the past couple of weeks. And I think
people are really taking note of our company.

I'll also share with you that through our Form 4s, perhaps, you've seen that management has been buying, and I'll leave it at that. But we're obviously
investing in our own company. We believe in our future.

We're going to open this up to Q&A now. And if you have any questions after this presentation and after this period, please reach out to Jeremy
or Matt with any questions. They'll be very responsive and help you, hopefully, with your question and give you an answer provided we can provide
that answer. So with that, Jeremy, I'd like to open it up to questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And thanks for everyone's patience there. And let's give everyone a minute to see if we get some questions coming in via
chat. And if everyone's feeling shy, no problem, we're certainly happy, Matt and I are, to field your questions off-line if people are happy to do so.

Still no questions coming in, Charlie. Do we want to give another minute or 2? Or if we want to wrap up, our contact info is there. Actually, got a
question that just came in, a couple.

First one, someone was asking about contracts, ""Are they fixed-fee? If you could maybe elaborate a little bit on contract structure, it would be
helpful.""

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
Sure. Our contracts vary. It depends upon the needs of the customer and what's the best economic situation for our company. Certain contracts
are fixed. Other contracts will provide guaranteed maximum price with a fee. Generally, the fee will go up if the cost of work goes up. A number
of our contracts that are lump sum, obviously we're looking to minimize our expense and maximize the fee outcome by minimizing labor or other
expenditures on the project to maximize profit. So it varies depending upon the customer need and what they're looking to do. And we've had
                                                                                                                                                                             
 great success doing all sorts of forms of contract, including -- although not -- it's not a regular occurrence, but occasionally, we'll sell a cost-plus
type contract with a fee markup on top of that.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. Another one asking about your competitors. ""Is anyone else pursuing a similar strategy with respect to the owner-direct model?""

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
It's kind of interesting. If you look at mechanical contractors in the United States, many of them start evolving to this over the course of time where
they'll really focus in on service and maintenance. What we're looking to do is to go way beyond that. And I mentioned the issue of predictive
analytics, getting involved with asset management, but more importantly, providing professional services like construction management, program
management, where we're actually going in, listening to our customers' needs and coming up with a really custom-tailored solution to help their
business.

So it's beyond just providing the preventative maintenance and the typical pull-through you get off of that type of work. This is really going upstream
and providing a service. And by the way, just a bit about my background. I've been here now for 17 years as CEO. But prior to that, I was 21 years
with a construction manager. It's now known as Lend Lease. We had sold the business. I stuck around for a few years and then came over to Limbach.
But what we did over there was provide those professional services to owners. And what we see here at Limbach, it's a great opportunity for us to,
quite frankly, do what I did at my last company and provide those professional services upfront. I think -- excuse me, we know, owners are thirsting
for predictability, and we believe by providing those professional services upfront, we can do that.

The other part of our professional services we're looking to expand is the -- really the start-up of buildings. When a building is completed, a general
contractor, one of their toughest tasks is actually getting the building operating and turning it over to the owner. I've had this conversation with
many, many CEOs of big construction managers and general contractors. And they are thirsting for a service, for us to come in and really help them
get those buildings up and running. So even if we didn't build it, it will allow us to help them, the general contractor, basically providing a good
solution to their issue.

But the important part of that is it provides the introduction of Limbach to the building owner on a building we did not build. So front-end services,
commissioning or back-end services will lead to the relationship with the owner.

So again, we're -- the constant conversation with management right now is our cherry-pick on the GC/CM side, but it's all about moving to the
owner.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. I've got a couple here on M&A for Matt. Question is, ""What do you want to see in terms of business performance and financial condition
before you feel like you're in a good spot to proceed with M&A?""

Samuel Matthew Katz - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - EVP of M&A and Capital Markets
I think our prerequisite for engaging more aggressively in the M&A program is feeling confident in the fundamentals of the underlying business
and the market, generally. We've worked very hard to generate the performance that we have year-to-date and to meaningfully improve the
working capital position in the company's liquidity position. We'd certainly like to refinance the senior credit facility at the appropriate time, as
Charlie and Jayme and I have mentioned in other forums.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And I think giving ourselves the flexibility from a balance sheet perspective to complete an M&A transaction without stretching the boundaries of
what we feel is an acceptable level of leverage is probably one of the key gating issues.

We've talked at various times about being comfortable with leverage that's perhaps somewhere between 2 and 3 on an interim basis, with the
opportunity and clear visibility to deleveraging on the back end of that, so that we can go out and then identify the next opportunity and continue
to invest in the business.

So again, that -- the focus is on continuing to generate solid earnings and feeling like we've got good visibility in our core markets and a good
pipeline, and good momentum behind the strategic pivot from the business, that's largely been heavily weighted towards construction in the
recent past, but is increasingly moving towards being weighted towards ODS; and really feeling like the M&A opportunities will further support
that strategy to Charlie's earlier comments and provide us with another asset to put in the portfolio, so to speak, that gives us another driver for
earnings and additional diversification from a geographic customer and project point of view.

So I think, again, the focus is obviously on the balance sheet. And then last, just on finding good opportunities. I think we're eager to get something
done for the benefit of the business versus being eager to get something done just because opportunities are out there. So we've been reasonably
disciplined around that. Historically we pass on many, many opportunities that don't get very far, and we tend to dedicate some scarce resources
towards the ones that are interesting, and those are out there. But we've also got a base business to run, and we're not going to take our eye off
of that.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Matt. Next question, talking about the derisking, when it comes to contracting and labor. And the question is, ""Why did you wait
until now to do that? Why wasn't that an embedded process already? Why isn't that the industry standard for that matter?""

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
Yes. Great question. Look, in 2016 into 2017, we actually sold work. And our -- when you look at these larger projects, they take 24, 30 months to
build. So some of the challenging projects we faced back in 2016, we took them on with an understanding we had proper labor to execute all of
that work. But what happened on these projects, we found that they were being delayed not due to us.

One particular project we're building a stadium known as D.C. United and the structural steel was 6 months late, and we can't build anything
without the steel being up. And that end date didn't change. That game was going to be played one way or the other, and the stadium had to be
finished.

So it just got massively compressed, and we had to work all sorts of hours, all sorts of days with different shifts. And we were compensated for
some of that. But when that happens, typically it's usually not a good outcome. And in our case, it wasn't. So what we did, and it was -- it's over 18
months ago now, we put in place -- I guess, it's 2 years now, the risk management processes that we're using today.

So the backlog that we've been selling over the past couple of years has been thoroughly scrutinized and we've taken on work that we feel really
good about as opposed to where we were at back in '16 and '17.

One of the other things we did in our company, we have certain risk processes that have been in place for years, but each business unit goes
through all of their projects each month. It's called a monthly project review, or MPR, and that rolls up into the Monthly Branch Review, or MBR. I
attend that, the COO attends that, our CFO attends that, along with several other executives. And the branch has to present where they're at. One
of the key components that we instituted, it's again over 1.5 years ago, labor management curves.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And we now -- they have present to us where they're out with their backlog of work and what they have coming up in sales that they expect to
win, and then you can see the projection of their labor needs as well as project management. And then you can see where the curve drops off and
that's where the new sales are needed. So we're only selling now with the capacity of the company to deliver.

The other thing I might add with the virus hitting, while the industry is still very busy because we're working off the backlog, you're starting to see
some ease in labor. So we're not going to take our eye off the ball. But the good news is, it's easing a bit. The boom is off and that's good, I think,
for the industry because the industry was overheated.

So we've put these things in place over the past couple of years, and you're now seeing the economic returns for the business come through. Q4
was good. Q1 was good, Q2 was good. I'm not going to comment any further about the future quarters. But we're seeing the fruits of our labors in
deploying better risk management.

The last thing, and I'll just admit this humbly, I've been in the business a long time, and I've managed risk for a long time. I did not see the labor
shortage hitting the way it did in '18 and '19. I'm very proud of my company in terms of how we take care of people. We've never had a problem
finding people, but the labor shortage really impacted the whole industry where you saw structural steel showing up late, other contractors not
doing their work because they couldn't find people.

So again, I made a mistake of not seeing that. That cost us dearly. But going forward, we've worked our tails off to make sure we have the proper
risk management oversight for the business. I'm quite pleased with what we have today and our COO is doing a tremendous job.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. Next up is a question about margins. ""How do your overall profit margins compare to your competitors?""

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
I think there's still opportunity for us to do better. I think from a standpoint of where we're selling our margins, our Risk Review Committee is --
where we see the opportunity, we're pushing margins up. We also see the opportunity on the owner-direct side, that's a much better margin profile.
So as we continue to rapidly expand that, we'll see better operating results come through on our bottom line.

When you look at the gross profit margins of the 2 segments, Construction generates margins between 8%, and that's a very low number, on up
to 15%. Generally, it's a 12% with a blended number. On the owner-direct, we're anywhere from 15% -- and again, that's on the very low end -- on
up to 40%, with a blended rate of about 25%. So we see opportunity to do a little bit better there. I think we can do better.

The other component in terms of operating contribution, I've mentioned earlier, we're -- I think, doing a much better job at rationalizing SG&A.
We're laser-focused on it, so we can contribute better on our bottom line. I think there is some work, we still have opportunity there. We see actually
within that, there's better purchasing power for us to go out nationally to do certain things, and we're actually working our way through that.

That's going to add -- excuse me, reduce certain costs in the business. And that will drop to our bottom line, which I think we'll get more on par
with the likes of our publicly traded peers. So we have work to do in front of us, but we see improvement in our future.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. And next one, similar question around competitors in the marketplace. And that is, as you move to focus on smaller jobs, is that a more
competitive market in terms of more contractors bidding for the work?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
Yes. Look, we're not a contractor. If someone comes to me and say, I have an opportunity, I'm bidding against 6 other mechanicals, we just shut
that down. We're not interested in getting into the bid game at low price. That's not our company. We're not the low-price provider. We're all about
building relationships up with our customer base and negotiating our work. So we see an opportunity where usually pretty early to the game,
whether it's with a general contractor or working with the owner to get to a negotiated stance. They may have a competitor or 2 that we'll work
with. But we're not looking to get involved where there's going to be 6 other competitive bids. That's not what our company does.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Okay. Next one is asking about opportunities to work with HVAC technology owners as a way of limiting virus risk and structures. Is that an
opportunity for you?

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
What we're seeing right now is there's a lot of filtration opportunities out there with bipolar ionization and UV filtration. We're seeing a lot of
opportunity with that, especially on the healthcare side. But we actually introduced it to schools -- it was about 2 months ago, where we've put a
very concerted effort out there knowing K-12 was going to be opening back up. So we've reached out to our school district customers or even
customers -- excuse me, potential new customers with school districts, making them aware that there's some different ways to create better indoor
air quality.

Other part with commercial office buildings, there's a lot of opportunity for us there. Again, with the air filtration, different filter media, but also
more high-tech type filtration to get occupants comfortable with coming back to buildings. So we're working that very aggressively. We see that
as a nice market. We are picking up business with that. That's pretty much all with our owner-direct type opportunities.

And then with our new construction, our engineering groups are working with different design professionals for the design that we're recommending
to put in high-tech filtration just to get the building to the next level of air filtration, so people feel better about being occupied in those buildings.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
All right. Thanks, Charlie. Another one for Matt on the M&A side. ""Can you give us an example of an acquisition that would support ODS?""

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
You're on mute, Matt.

Samuel Matthew Katz - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - EVP of M&A and Capital Markets
Thanks, Charlie. We see a variety of opportunities obviously. The ones that would support the ODS strategy are somewhat over the map. But to
give you an example, this would be a privately owned and operated business in a secondary or tertiary geography. It's a somewhat protected
region from a competitive standpoint. The business -- I'll just pick a revenue number for argument's sake, if it's a $50 million business, perhaps 2/3
of the revenue comes from a series of relationships with small-middle market industrial companies that may be in food and beverage, specialty
chemicals, light manufacturing, perhaps Tier 2 and 3 auto parts. And in those cases, the contractor is literally inside the chain link fence 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, working for the owner of that facility on maintenance and small capital projects.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And the remaining 1/3 of revenue is likely larger-dollar construction in market for healthcare or for higher education, servicing the local or regional
hospital chain or the local or regional university system. And so when there's a larger capital project in one of those end markets, the target company
almost certainly gets the work given relationships between the customer and the owner of the business and control of labor in that market.

So again, there are no 2 businesses that are the same, but that's one example of a business that would be very supportive of the ODS strategy given
the significant amount of work of a small dollar value, both maintenance and small capital projects that's performed for the facility owner or the
facility owners.

The other example would be just a small service tuck-in acquisition perhaps in an existing geography where we see an opportunity to accelerate
the growth of our maintenance base. And our pull-through work, again, probably a privately owned and operated company, second or third
generation, maybe $10 million or $15 million with $2 million or $3 million of maintenance base and an owner who's in his late 60s, and he's looking
for a generational transition or a liquidity event, and who doesn't have children in the business or wants to see his company go to a good home,
and who has worked either for Limbach or alongside Limbach for many, many years; knows the company, knows the individuals and feels very
comfortable with us taking that business going forward.

So 2 of many data points but hopefully representative of things that are in the market that would support the ODS strategy.

Jeremy Hellman - 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. - Senior Associate, The Equity Group Inc.
Great. Thanks, Matt. Well, that gets us to the end of our question queue. So Charlie, I'll give it back to you for a couple of closing comments, if you'd
like.

Charles A. Bacon - Limbach Holdings, Inc. - President, CEO, & Chairman
Yes. Look, please, if you're interested in our company and you want to learn more, reach out to Matt, reach out to Jeremy, and they'll be very
responsive, so we can help educate you a bit more about where we're going and what we're doing. I want to deeply apologize to everybody -- we
got hacked somehow and I don't know how that happens, but I think all of us were hearing about how Zoom calls occasionally were being hacked,
especially at schools with terrible stuff. So I heard what I heard. My apologies if you heard the same thing. We're going to be looking into that and
make sure that -- or how to prevent that in the future.

Look, we're excited about our future. We had a couple of challenging years. We're back to where we should have been a couple of years ago. But
I'm very excited about our future. We're -- I think we're working all the right levers to profitably grow our business, and we're taking it in the right
direction that will maximize our bottom line. So thank you so much for your interest and wish you all the best.

PRESENTATION
Ravi Pamnani - PepsiCo, Inc. - SVP of IR
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this prerecorded management discussion of PepsiCo's third quarter earnings results. My name is Ravi
Pamnani, and I am the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at PepsiCo. Joining me today are PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta;
and PepsiCo's Vice Chairman and CFO, Hugh Johnston.

Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. We will make forward-looking statements on today's call, including about our
business plans and 2020 guidance and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Forward-looking statements inherently
involve risks and uncertainties and only reflect our view as of today, October 1, and we are under no obligation to update.

When discussing our results, we refer to non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items from reported results. Please refer to today's earnings
release and 10-Q available on pepsico.com for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures and additional information regarding our
results, including a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from forward-looking statements.

As a reminder, our financial results in the United States and Canada or North America are reported on a 12-week basis, while substantially all of our
international operations report on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of June, July and August are reflected in our results for the 12
weeks ended September 5, 2020.

And now it's my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta.

Ramon Luis Laguarta - PepsiCo, Inc. - Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Ravi, and good morning, everyone. My agenda today will include a detailed discussion of our business performance and a reiteration
of the guiding principles and priorities on becoming a faster, stronger and better company. I will then turn it over to Hugh for additional perspectives
on our financial results and 2020 outlook.

But before I start the business review, I'd like to note that I am very pleased with how our people and businesses have performed in what continues
to be a complex and volatile environment. As this environment continues to evolve, we remain very focused on controlling what we can with an
unwavering commitment to keeping our employees safe, servicing our customers to the very best of our abilities and supporting our communities
in both good and difficult times.

The dedication and resilience of our employees have been nothing short of exemplary during these times, and I want to thank them for everything
they do.

Now with respect to our business performance, our organic revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter. Our global snacks and food business
remained resilient, while our global beverage business returned to growth. Specifically, our Q3 organic revenue growth accelerated to 4.2%, with
both our North America and international businesses, delivering mid-single-digit growth. Our global snacks and food businesses delivered 6%
organic revenue growth, while our global beverage business delivered 3% organic revenue growth. The global beverage business meaningfully
improved versus the previous quarter with especially encouraging results in our PepsiCo Beverages North America division.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Core constant currency operating profit increased 5%, and reflect that increase in our advertising and marketing spend, and core constant currency
EPS increased 9%.

Now starting with North America snacks and food, both Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods continued to deliver robust growth as at-home consumption
trends have remained strong despite the measured reopening of economies and activities in certain areas since May. Frito-Lay sustained its strength
with 6% organic revenue growth and gained market share in the macro snack category in the quarter. These results were powered by strong net
revenue growth across each of our billion-dollar brands, including double-digit growth for Tostitos, high single-digit growth for Cheetos and
mid-single-digit growth for Doritos and Ruffles.

We also saw continued strength in the e-commerce and large-format channels, while trends in the convenience and gas channel meaningfully
improved versus the previous quarter.

And finally, Frito's core constant currency operating profit increased 4% in the quarter, which included a strong double-digit increase in advertising
and marketing spend and additional COVID-19-related costs.

Quaker Foods delivered 6% organic revenue growth, along with an improvement in household penetration rates in the quarter. Quaker's revenue
growth was in line with what we had expected, and consistent with where the business was trending after economies in certain areas began to
reopen during the second quarter. Quaker's third quarter performance included strong double-digit net revenue growth in light snacks and side
dishes, such as pasta and macaroni and cheese. Pancake mixes and syrup sales increased at a high single-digit rate, while both hot and ready-to-eat
cereal also delivered good growth. Quaker's strong net revenue growth and cost management initiatives resulted in 170 basis point increase in
core operating margin and 14% increase in core constant currency operating profit.

Now I will turn to our North America Beverages business where we delivered a strong improvement in results, with 3% organic revenue growth
and 12% core constant currency operating growth.

Many of our large brands performed well with double-digit net revenue growth for bubly, Lipton and Starbucks, high single-digit growth for
Gatorade, mid-single-digit growth for Mountain Dew and Tropicana, and low single-digit growth for Pepsi.

Innovation has continued to play an important role in the portfolio. For example, Gatorade Zero, bubly and Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, in aggregate,
have delivered more than $1 billion in retail sales on a year-to-date basis. We also continue to invest in our successful Pepsi Zero Sugar product,
which has grown in its retail sales by more than 30% year-to-date.

From a channel performance perspective, both the large-format and convenience and gas channels delivered strong growth while the decline in
foodservice channel moderated. Our market share trend within the liquid refreshment beverage category improved versus the previous quarter,
and we gained market share in the coffee, tea and juice categories. We also executed well on our net revenue management initiatives in larger
categories such as carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks.

In addition, our expanded presence in the energy category contributed to our net reported growth and reported operating profit in the quarter.
We are very excited about our expanded presence in this highly profitable category with our recent acquisition of Rockstar and distribution
agreement with Bang.

Our focus will remain on improving the performance and marketplace execution of these terrific brands while also effectively competing in the
category with existing brands such as Mountain Dew. Overall, I'm very pleased with PBNA's performance during the third quarter. I'm encouraged
by our North America energy integration process as it nears its completion.

Moving forward, I remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the North America Beverage business and believe we have the right plans
and portfolio in place to deliver sustainable growth and margin expansion over time.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 In summary, our North America businesses performed well in the quarter, and we expect our snacks and food business to remain resilient while
our beverage business should sustain its momentum for the balance of this year.

Now I will turn to our international businesses which improved meaningfully versus the previous quarter and delivered 4% organic revenue growth
in the third quarter.

Our international snacks business remained very resilient and delivered 5% organic revenue growth while our international beverage organic
revenue increased nearly 2% as pandemic-related closures and restrictions eased to a certain extent in some markets. Within our international
markets, developed market organic revenue growth increased 8% and outpaced developing and emerging markets, which increased 2%. Some
notable highlights include double-digit organic revenue growth in France, Australia and Brazil, high single-digit growth in India and mid-single-digit
growth in the U.K., China and Russia.

We gained savory share in many of our key snack markets, including Mexico, Brazil, China and Russia. And for beverages, we gained share in the
U.K., Russia, Turkey, France, Germany and Thailand. And finally, we again delivered strong double-digit net revenue growth in our SodaStream
business, as consumers continue to adopt this environmentally friendly, convenient at-home beverage system.

Now to touch on the outlook for our international businesses, we expect our snack business to remain resilient while the recovery for our beverage
business may take more time due to ongoing and reinstated pandemic-related restrictions and closures as it relates to certain channels.

From a geographical perspective, we continue to expect our performance to vary between developed and developing and emerging markets due
to differences in pandemic-related impacts and responses, disposable income and affordability metrics, foreign exchange dynamics and fiscal and
monetary policy support.

To conclude, I believe our overall business is performing well and is benefiting from the diversity and breadth of our portfolio and strategic actions
we have taken to complement our growth agenda. We are content with your composition of our portfolio and are more focused now on maximizing
the full potential of our existing and recently acquired assets to drive improved growth and returns over time as we aim to become an even faster,
stronger and better organization.

And I'd like to spend a few minutes on reinforcing this strategic framework that prioritizes our actions and behaviors within the company. When
we say faster, we mean that we must win in the marketplace and improve market share by being more consumer-centric and investing in both
large, established brands and smaller emerging brands to accelerate our growth.

Our key priorities to become faster include: sustaining or improving growth and market share in our high-return snacks and food businesses in
North America; improving the profitability of our North America Beverage business and capturing our fair share of category growth; accelerating
our growth and presence in international snacks and food while investing wisely in beverages to balance between growth and returns; and making
the necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity, go-to-market systems and digital initiatives such as improving our presence and scale
in our e-commerce business, which nearly doubled during the third quarter.

When we say Stronger, we mean that we must continue to transform our cost structure, capabilities and culture. Our priorities here include a
renewed focus on driving holistic cost management throughout all our organization to support our investments in advantaged capabilities such
as: a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; more precision around revenue management; investing in data analytics that can provide
more granularity around consumer insights; and we continue to invest to further expand global business services into new capabilities, which will
enable better insight and support for our businesses at a much lower cost.

With respect to transforming our culture, we're committed to diversifying our workforce, balancing internal views with more outside-in thinking,
and reinforcing the PepsiCo way, where we emphasize that employees act like owners to get things done quickly.

And when we say better, we're focused on further integrating purpose into our business strategy and brands by becoming planet positive,
strengthening our roots in our community and advancing social justice. For example, we're committed to becoming planet positive by supporting

                                                                                                                                                                             
 practices and technologies that improve farmer livelihoods and agricultural resiliency. We're also focused on using precious resources such as
water more efficiently, accelerating our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our value chain, and driving progress towards a
world where plastics need never become waste by focusing on reducing, recycling, and reinventing packaging.

And when it comes to our people across the value chain, PepsiCo remains committed to advancing respect for human rights, building diverse and
inclusive workplaces, and investing to promote shared prosperity in local communities where we live and work.

In summary, I believe we're executing well against our strategic framework and remain well positioned for future success with our portfolio of
large, trusted brands that participate in attractive and growing categories; a team of trusted and highly seasoned business leaders; a very powerful
go-to-market distribution system; and an agile end-to-end supply chain network.

Before I conclude my portion of this discussion today and turn it over to Hugh, I want to reiterate that I'm incredibly proud of the way our organization
has executed and performed to what has been an incredibly complex and dynamic environment, and I want to thank everyone again for their
dedication and efforts.

With that, I'll turn it over to Hugh.

Hugh F. Johnston - PepsiCo, Inc. - Vice Chairman, Executive VP & CFO
Thank you, Ramon, and good morning, everyone. As Ramon covered in detail, our business performance improved in the third quarter, and we
delivered 4.2% organic revenue growth. I'll focus my commentary on our profit performance and financial outlook for 2020.

From a margin perspective, our core gross margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter. The year-over-year decline is driven by our recently
completed acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cherry and certain COVID-19-related costs included in our cost of goods sold.

Our core operating margin decline moderated and was down 40 basis points in the quarter as we increased our advertising and marketing spend
and experienced $147 million of higher labor, personal protective equipment and logistics and service costs associated with COVID-19. When
excluding the incremental COVID-19-related costs, our core operating margin increased 40 basis points.

We expect some of the COVID-19-related cost to persist and remain committed to making the necessary long-term investments to support our
employees and customers while also investing in capabilities that drive competitive advantages for our business.

To mitigate some of these challenges, we have continued our efforts to control what we can. This includes tightly managing our discretionary
expenses, reducing nonessential advertising and marketing spend to reflect the realities of the current environment, and sharpening our revenue
management capabilities across brands and packages.

Now as we look forward, and consistent with Ramon's earlier comments, we do expect our North America businesses to remain resilient for the
balance of the year while the recoveries across international markets will likely remain uneven across both developed and developing and emerging
markets.

So based on what we can reasonably predict for the balance of this year, we are updating our full year guidance and now expect organic revenue
growth of approximately 4% and core earnings per share of approximately $5.50, and we continue to expect a core annual effective tax rate of
approximately 21%.

Based on current market consensus rates, we now expect foreign exchange translation headwinds to negatively impact our net revenue and core
earnings per share performance by negative 2 percentage points, and this expectation is reflected in our core EPS guidance.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 With respect to cash flow, we now expect full year cash flow of approximately $6 billion, which reflects net capital spending of approximately $4
billion and continue to expect total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion, comprised of dividends of $5.5 billion and share
repurchases of $2 billion.

Our expected cash returns reflect a 7% increase in the annualized dividend per share that began in June. This represented the company's 48th
consecutive annual dividend per share increase.

With respect to our liquidity and balance sheet, we continue to believe that we have ample flexibility to meet the reinvestment needs of the business

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
Good afternoon to everyone. Thank you very much for your participation. Today, we have the presentation of a balance of 6 months. Here, our
company is being updated regarding its reports in terms of obligations and investments. This reflects a reality and we will talk subsequently about
this. There is a point that reflects the record -- we want to show the public that we're being transparent. And here we have, on the bottom line, a
bad result of entries that are not frequent in our financial statements, but they have been recognized only one time.

On the other side, we have a different view because of the pandemic. And now we have a strong operating focus. All the executive committee is
in place. We integrated our business together with our executives, and our main businesses are being integrated in business-to-business Brazil.
And this integration of the business is creating synergies and giving us competitiveness, and we are reducing internal costs.

We have around 1,200 stores operating. Before the pandemic, we had 1,360, so we have most of our stores working. And some have been closed
because of the pandemic, and now we have a good -- we are 100% operational. There's no product, no partnership that has been interrupted, and
we have had no reduction in terms of personnel and business. The other way around. In this period, we have our entire structure that is new. Today,
we have a company of high standard with a high level of governance in its fronts of internal controls, auditor and governance. By and large, we
will be an example of organization.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 We concluded the review of our values and proposals, and I would like to highlight the commitment in terms of governance, sustainability, a new
model with both that is sustainable from environment and from the business point of view. We are reviewing our strategy with the support of
McKinsey and this review is half the way done, and we will conclude it by the beginning and the middle of November. And this is an important
effort so that we have all our business and all our people focused on the future.

At the same time, we are reviewing our brand, carrying out a brand architecture effort in order to simplify the operation and to have a more relevant
communication. Obviously, we have over 10 brands today. And today, we are going to rationalize and simplify this, and this will be done together
with our strategy. We are also reviewing our technology and process. We want to gain synergy, scale, crosses where we're integrating systems that
were bought throughout the companies in the past years. This is something that is fully ongoing and everything will be done this year, so that we
end the year with the new company's view and resume our business more focused.

Sales are growing rapidly. The resumption in the domestic market is solid. The company, as a whole, is 45% of sales compared to last year's. If you
consider that international sales are weak, the sales in Argentina are also very low. The Argentine market is undergoing a more difficult situation,
and the corporate sales are also very weak. So domestic is resuming, and the company has 40%, 45% for sales, but this is -- well, and we are growing
positively.

We continue with all the investments in the digital market. The digital transformation that will be done in the upcoming weeks and months where
we will launch things from the platform point of view and from the product point of view, we are investing a lot in innovation. We are going to
launch like 5 new products this year, all of them for customers to -- and focused on the end customer. We are also building a new model of
distribution. We are investing in digitalization that we will see as of next year in our brands, in our stores, and we have a robust cash flow today.

As we already announced, this cash flow allows us to face the crisis and we continue sound, and we will be able to continue with the capacity of
resumption and to continue leading the tourist industry in Brazil and win the support of our shareholders. When -- something that we saw in the
first stage of the capitalization, so we have support. We're going in the right direction.

So this balance sheet represents great losses, but these are losses that were recognized and in a transparent fashion, now we can see the future.
And our transparency is very strong in this management, and our commitment to the future is strong so that we consider -- we continue leading
the Brazilian and the Latin American market of tourism.

I will give the floor to Mauricio Montilha, my colleague, that will give you a more -- a better view of our figures. Mauricio, now you have the floor.

Mauricio Teles Montilha - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - Chief Financial and IR Officer
Thank you, Leonel. Good afternoon to everyone. It's a pleasure being here today. Very briefly, I will go through our presentation because I believe
it's more interesting to have more time to answer questions.

On Chart #4, we have -- Leonel showed us that we have a resilient business. Our cash position is interesting and relevant because we are at ease
and we have time to adjust ourselves and to honor our commitments together with our customers, and we have the support of our shareholders
that have invested more capital that has allowed us to create more funding. And we have had a resumption of sales during the first quarter, and
the second quarter are very relevant in the volume of businesses because many destinations were closed.

In the next chart is a highlight of our capitalization that was very successful. And we also distributed an excess of funds, and there will be another
stage between December and January of next year. And we believe that this will be an important process. The capitalization is to bring resources
so that we can resume in the market. So we have this for the company to survive and to fulfill all the commitments of the company, and this
capitalization has come in an adequate moment when we're resuming our businesses, and we have the ability to finance these travels from here
on.

Now when we go to the next slide, I would only like to mention something of the first semester. And this is something that all the companies are
undergoing. We have to assess the value of some assets that we had. So we did have an impairment regarding our goodwill based on the increase

                                                                                                                                                                             
 of the discount recs, and there is an extension of the cash flow when you include the COVID. And then you can see the value of the assets is lower
than in the beginning. We also had a reversal of deferred tax assets. The company normally will be able to recover these tax assets. Due to the
uncertainties, the company had to write-off accounting and as soon as the uncertainty goes away when we negotiate the debt with the capitalization,
I believe that we will go back to our normal numbers. And we will be able to credit this in the future.

But the good accounting practices. Because of the change that COVID brought to us regarding the economy in terms of available income and
employment and for the portfolio, we have an estimated losses. And we registered these losses that we believe that will go until the end of the
year. And this is in the balance of the first quarter. And we recognize them as effects of the pandemic. These are extraordinary adjustments, and
there are other things.

We repatriated passengers that were in Europe and in Asia and other credits that we lost. These are extraordinary adjustments. In this presentation,
when we talk about adjusted net debt, these are extraordinary expenses that we believe will not appear in the future. As Leonel said, the market
is resuming. I would like to highlight the system, and Leonel mentioned the booking of hotels.

The resumption also means to us the importance of governance and control. We spent some time adjusting and representing the financial statements
of the past and showing all the mistakes. We are operating at another level right now, but we have an important plan of governance in the company
that has already started. We have a management in charge of compliance, and we have a relevant and detailed program to improve controls,
processes, everything that supports the financial management of the company. To us, this is very important when we resume businesses. What is
important is to maintain a sound company from hereon.

Now when we talk about the results in Brazil, now we're on Page 8. The pandemic is one of the most relevant impacts that we had in our results
and this -- the onset was at the end of the quarter, but we had a drop in volume due to the Northeast. That was the oil spill that reduced the season
in the Northeast. That is very important to CVC. And there was a drop in prices, but it impacted the mix. And this impacted the first quarter. This
would be -- went from 43 to 33, the boarding indexes. And this -- and the -- and in the Northeast, they dropped from 22 to 18, and international
boarding, this also dropped a lot. Now it is important to remember the domestic market represents 85% of our new businesses. This is something
that we see during the third quarter. And in terms of quality of revenue, this is very important for CVC and this is one of our great strengths.

On the next page, Page 9. During the first quarter, we couldn't react and the expenses of the companies were lower than what we see generally.
Nonetheless, this is an important matter, and we are looking for operational synergies, commercial synergies in the businesses where we're present,
especially B2B and these operational synergies among the group. And we're also reviewing the activities of the company, something that we will
continue. And this is very important. We believe that during the first quarter, we didn't see any effects, but this is a very important issue during the
second quarter. We had a significant drop of expenses, and we want these synergies and reductions to be permanent in our company.

Now on the next chart. This illustrates our portfolio, and here you can see that the provisions increased because of the additional provision that is
an expectation in terms of loss because of the future impacts of COVID. Important is that we are taking new actions because credit risk has changed
between post-pandemic and pre-pandemic period, even for risk scores. We have greater upfront-s than in the past, and we have also adopted our
credit score to a new reality. So we are prepared for self-financing, and this is a better quality of what we saw last year.

Now Brazil, during the next chart, when we talk about EBITDA and net income, the main component of loss there -- there was a loss. We could not
offset the lack of boarding.

Now speaking quickly about Argentina, that is on Page 13. Argentina is facing a similar situation than Brazil. We believe that the pandemic is
impacting them more because the economic situation in Argentina was already deteriorated because of income and unemployment. They -- there
was an exchange variation that was important. And this also exerts pressure over the sales of international sales. So here we see a more accentuated
impact in Argentina in terms of businesses.

Now the consolidated results. Here, we see the impacts. Here, we had bookings, we had minus 31%; and net revenue, 36%; and there was a significant
reduction of our EBITDA because we couldn't adjust our cost base to the new reality. When we talk about cash generation, this period was very
                                                                                                                                                                             
 important. And throughout the cash generation in March, during the beginning of the pandemic, when we realized that the pandemic was going
to -- was here to stay, we preventively, we had BRL 440 million of prepayment of credit card receivables.

The first quarter is a period of negative cash generation because we have all the hotel payments, the hotels that were used during January and
February. So the cash flow was according to what's expected and even more positive because of the prepayment of cash. And this during a moment
of uncertainty, we did not repay anything anymore, and we had a positive working capital.

The risk is that ours -- so the company -- this -- we didn't see the impact of the pandemic at that moment. Our indebtedness has not changed. It is
important to mention that, in our opinion, the capital structure that we have is reasonable when we see our business in the mid and long term,
excluding the pandemic. And because of the new curves of revenue and cash flow, we are renegotiating together with our creditors all of our
contracts.

So it is very important to highlight that we have been aligned with all the stakeholders of the company, be it investors, in shares, variable income,
be it our Board. So the company can resume soundly. And now we are focusing on becoming leaders that have a sound company, and this is the
best pathway to generate value to all of us and for the future.

Now my last comment. Of course, we measure the return over invested capital based on the EBITDA that was affected by the pandemic. So during
the first, which as you can see here, is way below the historic average of the company. Now I will give the floor back to Leonel so that we can go
to the Q&A session. Thank you very much.

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
I think that we can continue and -- with our Q&A session.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we will start by Olivia Petronilho from JPMorgan.

Olivia B. Petronilho - JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst
I have 2 questions. One is of short, midterm when we see the take rate. The take rate of the first quarter was quite messy. But when we compare
to the figures that you published in 2018 and 2019, do you believe that the take rate will normalize in the upcoming 6 or 12 months?

And now a strategic question. So -- and you are reviewing the marketing of your company. I would like to know what your next steps will be. I
would like to know what the strategic -- what the strategy of the company would be operationally.

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
This is Leonel. Olivia, thank you for your question. Regarding the take rate, the first quarter is very difficult. It was full of turmoil because in addition
to all the operating matters, we had a drastic change in the end of March because of the pandemic. Today, we operate with a take rate that is
aligned with last year, and I see no take rate pressure in the upcoming quarter. I believe that we have opportunities when it comes to reviewing
businesses and action and also favored by the domestic mix. And as the market has a low demand, this favors us in terms of negotiations with take
rate.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 As the supply market, CVC is a strong company able to resume, and they have given a favorable and good prices, and we have also created a pricing
structure that has a view that is focused on margin and in opportunities, not only in products. We're analyzing channels, the customer profiles and
demand. This is an ever-growing effort that favors profitability. I see no pressures. I only see opportunities. So the take rate is now point of attention,
but with the complete review of credit and collection and a strong review to have better operational capacity and better profit in our credit portfolio.

Regarding our strategy. In brief, in a number of weeks, we will have another call to show the results of the second quarter. That is also pending.
And in this call, I intend to shed light on our strategy. But I can say the following. We have separated our businesses in B2B, B2C and online. In B2B,
the integration is giving us margin gains, and we have an ever-growing market share. The most [fragilized] competitor does see us strong. So
certainly, we will spearhead the tourism industry and the market of small agencies.

And the other side, we gained a greater competitive advantage because of the partnerships that we had with our suppliers, especially hotel chains
and airlines in B2C. We have a physical share that is significant so we focus now on the domestic. Our CVC brand is top of mind. Our distribution is
intact, and we are totally focused on transforming our stores in a point-of-sale, totally integrated, totally digitalized, that is modern, and this is what
we will focus on the upcoming 1, 2, 3 years to transform the experience and integrate the -- our customers towards their digital platforms. And this
means that investments or strong investments in modernization.

And we have an online business where traditional CVC is not a leader. We have never -- we never created a long-term plan. This is being done right
now, with all the investments in digitalization have been approved and even why important, at least in my view, there is no use in digitalizing if
you don't know in depth your customers and you don't have a strong relationship strategy and data science and knowledge in pricing. The company
has this. And now we are going to present in the upcoming weeks novelties regarding this. We are working on our brand as well.

So we will be the one of the main players in the market in OTA, in digital transaction. But this doesn't mean that we're changing the physical,
because we are the only agent in the market that can be omnichannel of tourism, and we will work this way. So that our customer is integrated in
any of our distribution channels or any platforms that they are using, we are going to work with market data in the future. I do hope I was able to
answer your questions.

Operator
Our next question, [Eric].

Unidentified Analyst
Leonel, Mauricio, so regarding the take rate. We would like to understand what exerted pressure on the take rate during the first quarter. Could
you give us more detail about the take rate of the first quarter?

And a second question regarding expenses, because you have done a good job regarding the expenses during the second quarter. And I would
like to know what the situation of the company will be until the end of the year.

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
I will give the floor to Mauricio, and I can add something at the end.

Mauricio Teles Montilha - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - Chief Financial and IR Officer
Thank you for the questions, Eric. There are 2 aspects. In December, there were price -- we had a complicated year and the oil spill in the Northeast
hindered the advanced bookings for the Northeast, and this impacted our results in August and September. That is a period where we sell a lot
towards the Northeast. So this was one of the main points.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 Now obviously, the volume didn't materialize in great scale, and the Northeast is very important. This is very important for our figures in B2C, and
the company sold more in mix. And this was more in the international business where we had lower margins. When you book international hotels,
our margin is lower, but these were the 2 components that affected the margins of the first quarter, which is a quarter that is -- that has a high
volume in Brazil, and it started weak, and we had good international sales but it was difficult in terms of margin.

Regarding our expenses, our aim is to have a more efficient company so we had to reduce during the second quarter our journey. But this is our
midterm objective. And I'm going to give you an example of what is happening today that although the pandemic diminished during the second
quarter, we are operational. Our operation to deal with the customers, to find solutions for our customers now that the airlines are coming back.
So we have a volume, a great volume of over 300,000 customers that we're taking care of or operating in order to find solutions for them. We have
a midterm efficiency target, and we are going towards our target.

The second quarter was intensive because of the drop of our journey. But now we have -- we want more permanent reductions. And they're not
automatical. Though we're working with low volumes, we have to work a lot in order to service our customers, especially now that we started
resuming our activities in the market, and we are strongly working to help our customers to travel because most of them have -- still have the credit
for the future. So we see a curve of efficiency appearing in the upcoming quarters, maybe until next year.

Unidentified Analyst
Could you tell me what the take rate was month by month? In March, you had to deal with the repatriation of some passengers. So I believe that
you suffered more pressure during some months.

Unidentified Company Representative
Unfortunately, we do not publish monthly information, but I would say, well, generically, we did not have peaks on a monthly basis. And the cost
of repatriation were taken from the take rate. So during -- well, the month of March wasn't impacted by extraordinary effects.

Operator
We have Gabriel Disselli from Santander.

Gabriel Seixas Disselli - Santander Investment Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Could you give us more details in terms of the financial soundness of the franchises? Can we expect more franchises to close? Will they be able to
deal with the demand? Could you give us more details?

Unidentified Company Representative
Gabriel, thank you for your question. This is a major challenge. This -- our business or entrepreneurs that were caught by surprise and this was the
sector that was hit hardest. So in the beginning of the pandemic, we had 0 in terms of revenues. What we did was because of our situation, we're
talking about the end of March, April and May, we were strongly working in order to survive in that company. What we did for our franchisees was
giving -- was to give them logistics support. We gave them legal support. We helped them. We intermediated the base with the market. I personally
participated together with banks, with public agencies, with the ministry, with the Ministry of Tourism, with local agents, (inaudible), the works
and the secretaries of tourism to give them support, and we were very successful with credits in terms of goodwill. We also restructured things
here so that they could have a share in our business when they rebooked our customers because the rebooking demand is strong.

And we transformed this in a competitive advantage where our customers could rebook their travels and our franchisees supported this. Now,
they are gaining -- they are starting to recover with the new times. I don't believe that more stores will close. Perhaps 10% less, but I don't -- I see

                                                                                                                                                                             
 them encouraged. We have been talking to them frequently, and they are focused on sales and focused on growing. So I see no risk in our physical
distribution. I believe that the worst has already passed. And now I see our stores operating. Some of them are even investing and rehiring more
personnel.

Gabriel Seixas Disselli - Santander Investment Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Could you give us more details regarding indebtedness? How have you negotiated your covenant? Can we expect some penalty because of the
covenant or because of debentures?

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
Mauricio?

Mauricio Teles Montilha - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - Chief Financial and IR Officer
When you see the operations, all of them increased in volume because the pandemic or the post-pandemic period brought another relationship
between risk and return. The risk of the business increased, and this is natural. And this is something that we thought we've seen in all the deals.
And there was an increase of risk and the adjustment of these rates is included when you hold a new contract. And we've been discussing normally
with our creditors. And what we're doing is what the entire market is doing but the market has repriced the risk for everyone.

What is important is that there is a positive alignment between us, investors, creditors, Board, our franchisees and our team and the best way to
obtain value is operating. That is something that we're seeing. We're operating independently. Our shareholders are investing in us so we can
resume ourselves, even our creditors. So yes, there will be a natural repricing movement but this will not be different from what you see in the
market in average because of prices and risks.

Gabriel Seixas Disselli - Santander Investment Securities Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. I think that this is clear. Could I pose one more question? A bit more optimistic. I believe that during the swine flu, some companies had to
file for bankruptcy. And my impression is that CVC benefited itself because their competition wasn't as strong as them.

Do you have a view on this? Or you will be able to see the situation throughout the year? Do you believe that you will naturally gain more market
share because of the soundness of the company and the size of the company?

Unidentified Company Representative
Gabriel, well, probably, yes, we will probably gain -- we are gaining more market share. I do not believe this is something to celebrate because our
mission is to transform our company in a better company, to be better every day and for it to be sustainable. And of course, with profitability, with
adequate controls. So I don't believe that we should base our strategy based on the frail competition because the tourism is an ever-growing
market. It underwent a strong crisis. I believe we have very good prospects for the future. Everybody wants to travel more.

We're in the correct market, and I believe that new competitors are going to emerge. And the ones that leave will be replaced for a new, so strategy
should not be based on this. In the short term, it has advantages because we will survive. Well, we have already survived and of course, we will gain
market share. But our strategy should not -- when we talk about our strategy, we shouldn't consider the frailty or the weakness of our competitors.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Unidentified Company Representative
Here, we have a question that was sent through our webcast from [Daniela Redhower] from [Telari]. Her question is, what is the prospect of the
take rate of the second semester of 2020? And moreover, if you could give us qualitative details for Brazil and Argentina.

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
Daniela, thank you for your question. It's a pleasure to answer your question. Currently, the take rate is sound. It is better. And we are favored
because the crisis gives us a greater bargaining power, and we have invested a lot in policy that I practiced at Smiles. We are modernizing our
pricing because the margin has to be more important than growth, although growth is fundamental between growing our having margin, we will
focus on having more margin in the upcoming periods because this is a more sustainable vision.

Our take rate prospect is favorable. I will not give you figures. In Argentina, it is uncertain. Uncertain because the market there isn't as strong as the
Brazilian market. And as there is no demand, you do not have margin to maneuver. But -- so I believe that the take rate is not a risk. It's an opportunity.
We will not see spikes in terms of growth, but it will grow.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Well, as we have no further questions, we will give the floor back to Mr. Leonel Andrade for his final comments. Mr. Leonel,
I hand it back to you.

Leonel Dias De Andrade Neto - CVC Brasil Operadora e Agência de Viagens S.A. - CEO
Thank you very much to everyone. I would just like to say that I'm highly optimistic. The worst is in the past. We have shown transparently our
problems and challenges. Our company is 100% operational, and we are stronger than the competition. And we have been favored by the domestic
market where we are leaders. We've maintained the best tourism professionals that are here, and we have people that have good culture of
governance, intelligence, and they have contributed with technology. So we have created a highly competitive and integrated team. So our
competitiveness has grown significantly. We guarantee the control of the pandemic.

So I've been 6 months in the company and I would say that during the 30 and 60 days, our focus was to guarantee the well-being of our employees
and customers. And we did this diligently, especially when it came to bringing customers to Brazil. We also focused on cash flow and the survival
of the company in a transparent way. Although we faced uncertainties in April and May, we will be able to balance the company. We have a robust
cash flow, and the company was able to weather the crisis thanks to the support of our shareholders and board. We have been transparent, and
we have worked to regulate our balance to put our company up-to-date with the market. And now is the best moment. When the crisis diminish
and perspective improves, we want to sell. We want to have margins. We have better relationships with customers, partners, and this gives us good
prospects.

In the upcoming weeks, we will hold another call. And I will show you in a consistent fashion, products, novelties and all the innovations of company.
And with all of this, I feel optimistic. I believe that we will recover and we will lead this recovery. Our company, it has the trust of its professionals
and its shareholders. I do thank you for your trust. Continue with us because we will be solid in the future. So thank you very much to everyone
and have an excellent end of the day. Thank you very much.

Operator
So the earnings result of the first quarter of 2020 has come to an end. We would like to thank all of you for your participation, and have a very good
afternoon.

PRESENTATION
Unidentified Company Representative
Good afternoon, folks. Welcome to the product and technology-focused bus tour style Q&A session for financial analysts at VMworld. We're going
to wait about 20 seconds for more folks to arrive. So please sit tight.

Now turning over to Paul Ziots, VP of Investor Relations.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Thanks, Ron. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our product and technology-focused bus tour style Q&A session for financial analysts at VMworld.

Before we kick off this session, we remind you that today's discussion may involve some forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risk factors, including those described in our 10-Qs, 10-Ks and 8-Ks VMware
files with the SEC. I'll also mention that we'll be posting a replay of this on our website, ir.vmware.com.

Structure for today will be Pat will kick us off with an overview of our trusted digital foundation, innovation in our 5 franchise platforms, along with
great new telco cloud momentum and our exciting new NVIDIA partnership. We'll then follow that with Q&A on general topics, strategic related
and telco and NVIDIA related. You can click the Q&A function in the bottom of your screen to submit questions at any time. I'll remind you of that
when we hit that point as well.

After that, Raghu will give a brief overview of our multi-cloud in modern applications franchise platforms, including our SaltStack acquisition,
including our Tanzu advancements and, of course, project Monterey, and that will be followed by Q&A on those topics.

And then Rajiv will jump in with an update on our networking, EUC or digital workspace and our security franchise platforms with our exciting free
trial for Carbon Black Cloud along with our Zscaler partnership. And then with any remaining time, we'll come back with more general Q&A and
try to catch some questions that we didn't get earlier. Zane, Shekar, Patrick and Ajay are also all on this call today, and you may see them appear
as they participate in Q&A. If anybody is wondering, Sanjay would normally be with us, but he's in a parallel event right now running concurrently.

You'll see we all have different looks and feels here. I chose to wear my VMware T-shirt. When I mentioned that, I'll share with you, Shekar said to
me, he said, Paul, I'm going to show up with the VMware etched into my heart. And I thought that was a wonderful reflection of how we probably
all feel. And so with that, I think it's a great way to turn it over to you, Pat.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Hey, thank you all so much. Appreciate you joining us. I would be much preferred that we were in a room together at VMworld and being able to
see your faces, interact, chat around the coffee with you. But this has been good. And despite some of the challenges of this environment, there's
also been some benefits as well. In VMworld this year, we're able to have over 150,000 registrants for a 48-hour around the world event as we've
been able to essentially go through all the geos, the work that we did to prepare the keynotes, the interactions with customers has really been
very well received. And in many ways, we're able to have more, not just more participants, 25,000 physically, 150,000 virtually, but also more
customers participating, more of our partners participating. And it really has been a tremendous couple of days for us as CEOs from Nike, Feeding
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Telekom, Moderna, PepsiCo and many, many others participating in VMworld this year. So a really phenomenal
couple of days for us. And as you've seen, many, many positive announcements coming forward.

At the highest level, we've titled the VMworld this year and the focus of our message has been the digital foundation for an unpredictable world.
And this picture, you've seen from us before, every year, we're refining, updating it a bit, this idea of Any Device and clearly, we've had some major
progress in our device strategy and in a period of COVID it has become even more important business area for us. Any Application, and again, huge
focus on how we enable and deliver the next-generation of applications. And maybe the biggest progress we've done in any area was Any Cloud.
And we'll update on these areas as we go through our time today, but a consistency of vision that we are pursuing and year-by-year and innovation
and acquisition, everyone has been building on this picture to make it more and more substantive as we help customers build, run, manage, connect
and protect. And those key words really are guiding how we're building out our portfolio of solutions for the future.

And if you go to the next slide, this was really the GPS for VMworld this year. Where it all starts on how do we enable our customers' business, their
applications and their data and putting that at the center of everything that we do. And against that, we start with our modern applications portfolio.
And since we announced Tanzu about a year ago, we've had tremendous momentum and quite a lot of updates this year at VMworld as we're
bringing the pieces together. And what we did with Pivotal and Heptio and Wavefront and Bitnami, all of these coming together to deliver the app
modernization platform. And clearly, one of the highlights of that and Raghu will touch on this a bit more, was bringing this into the core of vSphere.
And now that, that's available for shipping. We're delivering on the promises that we set last year laying out this clear solution portfolios through
our basic standard, advanced and enterprise additions, bringing that portfolio into the industry at scale.

And of course, that is built on the VMware Cloud. And this multi-cloud approach that we're pursuing has gained more and more resonance with
our customers. And it's been a tremendous 6 months because now we have every hyperscaler now with a VMware offering in their portfolio and
the Amazon and IBM solutions. But now next to them is the Azure and Google and Oracle, and Alibaba Solutions, truly multicloud. And Raghu will
update on our SaltStack acquisition as well as we build out more of the automation solution. Our customers are standardizing on the VMware
Cloud, as we heard from people like JPMorgan, who are simply operating extraordinary scale for our app-layer and our multi-cloud layer and
increasingly looking to us to automate and bring more and more efficiency and scale for that solution.

Third was digital workspace. And this has really been the star of the show in the COVID era. And as customers went from maybe a few hundred
remote workers to tens of thousands overnight in digital workspace. And many of the things that we've been announcing this week in terms of
improving that workforce experience has gotten increasing momentum from our customers. And of course, we connect it all together with our
virtual cloud network, our network solution and for this week's announcements with SASE and Zscaler and what we're doing to build an end-to-end
network from the data center to the cloud and to the edge. And this is where our Monterey project uniquely fits the next major re-architecture of
vSphere and ESX. And Rajiv is going to touch on this a little bit more as we've seen this opportunity. It's much like we did with Project Pacific, take
this incredible platform of vSphere and make it containers and VMs. That's now shipping and fully available.

Now it's how do we take that same platform and make it GPU, CPU and DPU and SmartNICs. And this has been an important next step in the
evolution of our core computing platform.

And next, the ability to secure all of the pieces. The intrinsic security message that we announced a little bit over a year ago when we did the Carbon
Black acquisition has been extraordinarily well received. And for this, we are just excited because we're not only creating a new business for us, but
we're solving an extraordinary pain point for our customers. Security is simply too hard. It's too complicated. It's not operational. We're spending
more and then losing more. We have to change the nature of this. And the announcement of our Carbon Black Cloud this week, right, building it
directly into vSphere and securing workflows really was one of my highlights of the keynote. What I get to say today is a bad day if you're a

                                                                                                                                                                             
 cybercriminal, we're that passionate about what we're doing here. And of course, everything that we're doing in the trusted digital foundation is
immediately being applied to our telco initiative as well.

And it really was spectacular. We had more telco participation activities. The announcements from Rogers, Singtel, now working on the VMware
platform, Deutsche Telekom and Tim Hatch's participation. We're just taking it up level in the excitement and interest, both in the core and in the
RAN for what we're doing in what we call telco Cloud, bringing the same thing that we've done in the data center to the telco and 5G infrastructure.
And for this, the work that we're doing at O-RAN, right, orchestration, automation, building on that same cloud foundation solution, really
industry-shaping.

The last piece that I did want to spend a few minutes before we go to Q&A, was the announcement of our NVIDIA partnership. And this was very
exciting for us. And I've known Jensen Huang. And as I like to say, Jensen, when I was at Intel, we were building CPUs, and he was building GPUs.
We sort of mocked them, boy, they're not really doing computer architecture, it's just the data flow stuff, but they were persistently pursuing. And
as I say, you work hard and you get lucky, right? The harder you work, the luckier you get. And NVIDIA has become the leading company in delivering
AI in the industry. And for that, it's created this island of AI, either in the cloud or in a corner of the data center and coming together with the leader
in enterprise data centers with the leader in AI is how can we democratize AI for every enterprise, and estimates show 10% to 15% of enterprises
use AI today in their application because it's too hard. It's over there. It's in the cloud, my data is here, how do I make it broadly available and we're
solving the problems of the infrastructure, the developer, right, and the deployment with our partnership with NVIDIA. So truly exciting.

They're also one of the partners of Project Monterey, right, which we're going to cover a little bit more later as well. But coming together, democratizing
AI, and we really see this in our developer in modern applications, how do we unleash not just developers in what they're doing today, what
containers make it easier with VMs and containers, standardizing with Kubernetes, but really leap forward to be the democratizer of AI into the
next-generation of application development. So with that, we're excited. It's been a tremendous few days that we had. Like always, we love this
time that we get to spend with all of you and answer your questions as well.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Okay, Pat. I think we'll start off with some buy-side questions this time. This is a slightly long question, but I think it's got a lot of meat to it. So I'm
going to read the whole thing here. And it says, longer term, looking ahead, let's say, we are in this world where enterprises have largely completed
their cloud migrations, call it, 5, 10, 15 years down the line. What's VMware's role in the enterprise? Is that the core enterprise customers are using
VMware cloud provider programs in managing applications and infrastructure on Tanzu? Or is there more we can expect VMware to roll out to
keep that installed base? Please walk through that long-term vision.

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. And let's look at it from 2 lenses. First one, where do we expect when people quote as the question says, are done with the cloud migration?
What does the world look like at that point? And we made a prediction of does the world move all public cloud? Or what does it look like? And we
predicted several years ago that we were going to get to this 50-50 point, maybe 60-40 point, right, as a stable point. And why do we see that
balance? And why have we emphasized forever that it will be a hybrid world, not as a way station to the future, but it is the future. And I've called
it the 3 laws of hybrid computing. The laws of physics, the laws of economics and the laws of the land.

And those 3 together are going to bring this balance point. And just looking at each one, the laws of physics. If I need high capacity, high bandwidth
data sets at the edge, I can't backhaul then to the cloud and then back to the edge. I need to build infrastructure at the edge and we believe,
particularly with 5G, this is going to usher in more and more infrastructure at the edge. And if you look at like what we announced with DISH and
our telco network, they say everything is the edge, right? As they're building out their greenfield network. So the first, the laws of physics will drive
more edge infrastructure for smart factories, smart infrastructure, streets, right, telco networks.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Second, the laws of economics. And boy, a well-run at-scale private cloud is 30-plus percent cheaper than moving to the public cloud. And if you're
an at-scale customer like Comcast, one of our customer testimonials, they said, boy, right? This is so much more efficient to be on-premise with
some capacity in the cloud, the laws of economics. And we're seeing that at-scale with our customers now, and we're seeing this balance of the 2
being a more efficient model economically.

Third, the laws of the land, right, where you just can say, boy, I'm not moving that data set to the cloud. I'm not leaving my premise. And we see
that in areas like public sector, in particular, where the laws of the land and the financial services will govern that balance between the 2. And like
we heard from JPMorgan at VMworld this year, they expect the vast preponderance, 90-plus percent will remain on-premise as a result of the laws
of the land and economics for 5, 10 years into the future.

So first point is we expect this hybrid world. And VMware is uniquely positioned right in the middle, the leaders in on-prem and partnered with
every hyperscaler and connecting those 2 worlds together. But the second aspect to your question is how do we monetize in an increasingly cloud
and SaaS world? And who are that -- this is very much where the vision of VMware that we build, run, manage, protect and connect workloads,
we're increasingly less tied to the data center. And I said we're on this journey to neutrality, where we got to say our customers, we'd like it on-premise
or in the cloud. We're making that for every product in our networking, the management of devices, the securing of the solutions, the automation
solutions. We're saying, we're okay either way. And we monetize it through our financials either way.

We're also helping, particularly through our Tanzu portfolio, helping build the next-generation of applications. Some of those will be cloud native.
Some of those will be hybrid. Some of those will be on-premise or on the edge. We're also building the developer tools, the security solutions that
will monetize the new applications not just the existing on-premise applications as well. We do expect that we're getting to that point where our
business becomes increasingly subscription in SaaS. We're monetizing the new apps and workloads that are being built, and we're doing a broader
monetization across automation, networking, security and end user. That's much more than the data center offerings of VMware today.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Okay. Let's shift to telco, Pat. We have a couple of telco questions, I think we should take. There are a number of questions coming in on some of
the other franchise platforms, which I think we'll take after Raghu and then Rajiv, it might be more logical. But the first telco is, Pat, many years ago,
you had said the crescendo of the 5G build out wave could begin around 2020. You hosted so many large telcos at VMworld. What are they signaling
regarding 5G build out spend, does the pandemic push it out or accelerate it?

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. If anything, the pandemic is accelerating it a bit because everybody is seeing this extraordinary surge in network demand at this point. As
everybody's home is becoming a rework office and an education center, just a surge in demand, if anything. And I think if you watch the interview
that I did with Tim Hatch's, Deutsche Telekom, he spoke very, very eloquently on exactly this point. So if anything, it's accelerating the 5G spend.
I was sort of expecting at the end of this year, more hitting next year. Now we're starting to see these commitments like we saw with DISH, with
Rogers with Singtel, Deutsche Telekom, all of these are starting to accelerate. And we feel extremely well positioned in this transition because
we've built over the last couple of years these reference customers that they've taken the full VMware stack into their core, now starting to reach
into the RAN as well. So we're well positioned to capture this wave.

And as you might have heard on our last earnings call that we really saw 3 strong areas in our pipeline for the second half of the year was, financial
services, public sector and telco. And we have a lot of major deals in the pipeline for second half. Many of those will get built out at-scale into next
year. I think that wave is now just starting to hit the marketplace. They sort of pass the, hey, we stood up 5G in some rural town somewhere, so we
could claim it on our marketing to now saying oh, we have to get it across our whole network over the next 12 to 24 months. Shekar Is online as
well. Anything else that you would add Shekar? And Shekar just did a fabulous job for the telco tracks as part of VMworld this week. It really was
quite spectacular and Shekar is now a TV star as well. So Shekar, anything you'd add?
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Shekar G. Ayyar - VMware, Inc. - Executive VP & GM of Telco and Edge Cloud
Well, first, I'd say everything you see in the video is real, except for the teleportation. So we're working on that. But overall, I would completely
agree, Pat. I think we have been surprised at the momentum. It is advancing fast, and we're seeing a number of telcos, I'd say, in addition to COVID
putting a stress on remote work and therefore, wanting networks to be more performant sooner. I also think that there are other catalysts. I mean,
people, for example, wanting to move off of Huawei in some geographies and therefore, taking the opportunity to become more virtualized in the
process. And then also, as they go from 4G to 5G, making sure they don't get shackled by vertical siloed infrastructures like they did in the past. So
absolutely, I think, thrilling to see -- and I think we're well positioned right place, right time in this information -- in infrastructure transition.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Let's get one more telco question in before we go to Rajiv -- I'm sorry, to Raghu. Shekar, if you wouldn't mind staying on in case you both want to
answer this, how does your 5G offering differentiate itself against others like hyperscalers? And I'm sure you want to talk about the other more
traditional telco providers here as well?

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. We've primarily been, I'll say, arguing to the industry that the vertical solutions of Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson, that's the way we used to build data
centers when we were doing vertical systems like Z Series, P series. And obviously, the data center industry has moved radically forward to software
cloud-based approaches. And that's exactly what we're now doing with our telco offering. And I've positioned what we've done in that space that
VMware is becoming the operating system for 5G, right? That common infrastructure, that applications and standardized hardware operate at,
and that's our telco cloud, as we call it. And that message is being increasingly accepted by the industry and the numbers that we posted with
Vodafone earlier this year, half the Capex, half the OpEx, 40% faster time to service delivery across their network. Now over 1,000 services running
on that, that's getting a lot of attention from the industry.

Clearly, we compete with others like Red Hat, but VMware is really establishing our rock hard enterprise position up forward. And now we're seeing
the hyperscalers wanting to get in the game. And we're saying hey, we've already done the connectivity of hyperscaler and how that connects into
the telco cloud as a result of our public cloud partnerships. But most telcos still say, hey, I'm going to run this in my network centers. That's where
I have the bandwidth. That's where I have the quality of service. I can't afford some of the different business models of cloud, but I want to leverage
them as well. And that's where our cloud connectivity and some of the edge solutions that we're building will be highly complementary to the
strategies of telco. And I think, again, we're very nicely positioned given the years of hyperscaler work that we've now been doing, on that Raghu
is going to talk about a little bit more. Shekar anything else that you would add?

Shekar G. Ayyar - VMware, Inc. - Executive VP & GM of Telco and Edge Cloud
Yes. And I think the only thing I'd quickly add, Pat, is that our strategy versus the hyperscalers is we want to enable the telcos to succeed in the
core, in the edge, in the RAN. But as the hyperscalers are being viewed very skeptically by telcos in terms of their long-term aspirations in this space.
I mean, would they want to become a telco themselves? Would they just take over the entire business? So I think we are very clear in terms of us
being a platform provider to the telcos, we have a greater footprint than anybody else on the core, and we are now looking to bring it to the edge.
And as you described, Pat, we're multi-cloud in our approach, and that is being valued by all of the operators we are talking to DISH being a great
example of one. So we feel like our strategy is definitely one of enabling the telco as opposed to competing with them.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Before we move over to Raghu, please stay on Raghu, but we just had one come in that I think Pat, you would want to address here. And then
others who have asked questions more specifically, there's a lot of great questions coming in on things like Tanzu and security and everything else,
we will get to those. But Pat here's a question, when talking to CIOs, there's a clear sense that companies need to accelerate their transition to
digital. Is this also the point where they start thinking more about taking a platform approach versus a best-of-breed approach as it relates to their

                                                                                                                                                                             
 infrastructure technologies. Essentially, does the acceleration to digital also create an acceleration in vendor consolidation, I know you like that,
and can you take wallet share at a faster pace as a result, any thoughts?

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. I love the question and the answer is simply, yes.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
And it was not a planted question. It's an exact question. I read it exactly.

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
When I go into CIOs all the time, and I say to them, you want fewer, more trusted vendors because you want less of your energy down the stack of
how you're putting those best-of-breed components together, you want more and more of your energy up into the applications business services
that actually differentiate and create business value. And every time you're putting these pieces together, you're not spending your most precious
technical talent on business facing value and services. And this is what we do. And a number of the customer testimonials at VMworld said it better
than we could from our own voice this past week, examples like the JPMorgan example, where they have said, hey, we've been on this journey,
we've been putting these pieces together. We're as good at it, right, as anybody in the world, but we're wasting extraordinary amount of energy
this way. They have standardized on the VMware Cloud in that sense. And they're bringing every application and service onto one standardized
cloud that gives them scale, gives them efficiency, gives them automation and cloud connectivity.

And that formula we're now replicating with Comcast and FedEx and Wells Fargo and company after company at scale is doing that. The telco
industry, like we were just talking about, is getting that same benefit. And we do really believe that allows us to be that platform and then layer in
more and more value as we're now doing with load balancers and Avi Networks, hey, if you got NSX, Avi is a no-brainer. And then firewall with
their new firewall announcements, those become easier and easier. And of course, we're now layering more value with SaltStack and automation,
right, because we're just saying, it's much better for us to build, standardize, operationalize at scale, and we really do see it, as you say, a consolidation
opportunity and a share of wallet opportunity that's delivering tremendous customer value.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Thanks, Pat. Raghu, if you'd please take us off into the world of multi-cloud and modern applications.
PRESENTATION
Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
All right. Thank you. So as Pat briefly alluded to, this slide encapsulates our cloud strategy. We firmly believe our customers are going to distribute
their applications across cloud, edge and continue with the data center, and they're going to have more than 1 cloud. So our strategy is to be able
to help our customers build, run, manage, connect and protect their applications, all of their applications, both traditional applications and modern
applications across any of the clouds they choose. We think this is a very unique strategy. There's no other vendor with the breadth of this build,
run, manage, connect, protect and the breadth of the cloud partnerships and the enterprise relationships. So this combination of 3 factors makes
us very unique in the marketplace. And this is, we believe, a secular bet that customers are making in this multi-cloud world.

Next slide. So consistent with the strategy, we continue to advance our portfolio on every one of these 5 areas. And I'll give you the highlights of
the first 3 buckets here, and Rajiv will talk about the next 2 buckets and end user computing. So build, there are a lot of questions on Tanzu, and

                                                                                                                                                                             
 we'll get to that in a second. So build refers to what we are trying to do with respect to helping our customers build modern applications and run
and manage these modern applications as well. This is achieved with the Tanzu portfolio. One year ago, we announced the Tanzu as the brand
name for our integrated build portfolio, bringing together Heptio, Pivotal, Bitnami, our homegrown efforts, Wavefront, et cetera. We are pleased
to say that the integration is now complete. We have now put it all together in the form of a go-to-market in terms of 4 integrated offerings, Tanzu
basic, standard, advanced and enterprise. And we announced these earlier this month.

The most notable advancement in Tanzu, of course, is embedding Tanzu into our core infrastructure offerings, both VMware Cloud Foundation
and vSphere. We did VMware Cloud Foundation in April. And at this conference, we announced availability of vSphere with Kubernetes. This
instantly democratizes Kubernetes and makes it available to all 300,000 vSphere customers. The next time they upgrade literally with a click of a
button, they can start setting up Kubernetes Namespaces. And tying to that is the rest of the Kubernetes -- sorry, the Tanzu portfolio will be able
to take advantage of all this footprint.

The second aspect of our portfolio, of course, is VMware Cloud Foundation deployed in all the clouds. This is what we call VMware Cloud. Our
flagship offering here is VMware Cloud on AWS. We continue to both grow customer mind share and deployments very, very rapidly. One key
measure of that is the number of hosts or the number of VMs, both of which have been growing at greater than 100%. We also announced new
innovations with Amazon Web Services, like the Transit Connect, which simplifies hybrid networking further. One of the key things we have done
across all of our cloud partners is announced the availability of the Tanzu portfolio on top of VMware Cloud. So the big benefit to customers is they
can use VMware cloud not only to migrate but also to modernize.

Also notable here is Microsoft announcing a new generation of their Azure VMware solution offering, which is generating a lot of customer interest.
Now tying it all together is our management layer, and we have advanced our management layer both in 2 dimensions. One is we're introducing
a new way of packaging and pricing in our management offerings such that a customer can start with our management offerings on-prem and
move to the cloud, all under one subscription that we call VMware Cloud -- sorry, Vmware vRealize Cloud Universal. That's a mouthful. But underneath
that, there are some new components. The most notable is vRealize Cloud AI. Some of you we have talked to you before about our Project Magna,
which is intended making the data center autonomic and self-driven if you will. And VMware Cloud AI is the first step in that, and that has gotten
great customer reception in the beta.

Another notable thing here is the acquisition of SaltStack, which furthers our automation agenda. It's a companion to vRealize Automation, whereas
vRealize Automation focuses more on the SDDC infrastructure, SaltStack focuses more on the workload. With that, we will be providing a more
complete solution. All of it is multi-cloud. All these services are now available as SaaS services, and you can purchase it under one SaaS subscription.
So this marks the start of our journey towards making management more of a SaaS offering, just like we did with our end-user computing offerings
2 years ago. So with cloud health continues to grow as being the primary way by which customers, public cloud customers gain control and
governance of their cloud. So these are some of the notable announcements. I left out some of the next level of detail, but I'm sure I can cover them
on the Q&A. And then Rajiv will talk about the remaining portions of the portfolio.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Raghu, I think you might want to talk to the Monterey slide here as well.

Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
Oh, thank you. Yes. So one of the key innovations in vSphere is what we call in Project Monterey. Many of you, I know for a many while, you know
I started life at VMware as the Product Manager for ESX and vSphere. 2 years ago, we announced one of the most significant innovations in vSphere
with Project Pacific. I would say this is the next major thing. And the reason is the next major thing is it fundamentally alters the form factor of
vSphere. There's a new generation of hardware called SmartNICs or sometimes called data processing units. And the SmartNICs, what they provide
is new, accelerated ability to run network functions, over time storage functions and actually generalized operating system functions as well. And
what we are doing now is working with a set of hardware vendors, notably Pensando, which is a startup and Intel and NVIDIA to take our technology,
which is the core ESX and the networking technology and the storage technology and put it into the SmartNIC.

                                                                                                                                                                             
 What it does is the following. One is it makes the core CPU available for more high performance, more bandwidth-sensitive workloads. And so it
greatly expands the sort of workloads that you can run. Secondly, it allows us to offload heavy stateless networking functions such as encryption
and firewall functions, et cetera, into the SmartNIC allows those things to operate at line speed, even as line speed goes from 10-gig and 25-gig to
50 and 100-gig and is needed for the next generation of AI applications and high bandwidth streaming applications.

Thirdly, it allows for us to advance the idea of intrinsic security because you can now isolate all ESX security as well as other security functions in
the SmartNIC and leaving the CPU to be the domain of workloads and any associated security risks, right? And last but not the least, all of the ESX
functionality and the networking functionality and the storage functionality can be shared across not only virtualized workloads as well as bare
metal workloads. And so this dramatically expands the purview of our networking management security functionality to apply to a much, much
broader envelope of workloads. So this is Project Monterey. There's a technology review that is starting now. The actual products we'll reveal further
down the line.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Okay. We have a lot of questions on Project Monterey, and Tanzu, in particular, Raghu. I'm going to try to, in some cases, combine them. But the
first one here will be on Project Monterey. Does Project Monterey have any impact on the installed base of x86 applications that run on VMware,
would they have to be rewritten to take advantage of the DPU?

Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
No, the applications do not have to be rewritten. But obviously, the DPU is new hardware, and this would be concurred with when customers want
move to new hardware. We typically see this in 2 patterns. The first wave, there'll be new applications, whether they be modern GPU applications
or high-performance applications for -- et cetera, et cetera, video streaming, et cetera, where you would be more inclined to put new hardware in,
and that's the first generation of, I would imagine, Monterey-based applications coming in. And then secondly, in terms of existing brownfield
upgrades, where traditional applications can also take advantage.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Okay. Great. I'm going to try to combine a number of different Tanzu questions into perhaps 2. So we have time to get to Rajiv and the other
portions of our business. We have a lot of great security questions coming in, too, which is nice to see. So Raghu, it's a slightly long one, but bear
with me here. It's encouraging to see the new announcements related to Tanzu and NVIDIA but one of the big questions I keep asking myself is
whether VMware has now or will ever have the mindshare among developers that will drive wide adoption of Tanzu relative to the many other
tools and app platforms that are out there from both larger competitors and high energy start-ups. How do you think about that mindshare issue
and how to get attention and love from developers? And you might want to pull in Ajay for this as well.

Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
Sure. So let me start, and Ajay, of course, can add on. When you think of VMware, if you think about vSphere or SDDC, you're correct, it is an
infrastructure company. When you think of VMware in terms of 2 words, Kubernetes and Spring, we are very much a developer and a modern
application company.

One of the little known things about the assets that we got as part of the pivotal acquisition is the development framework called Spring. Spring
is a #1 development framework for Java developers by a long shot.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 And today, if you think about the enterprise development community, not the development community at large that's building gaming and other
applications. The enterprise development community is centered around Java and Spring or around .NET and the Microsoft technologies. And the
momentum on Spring is actually accelerating significantly as developers go from traditional Java 3-tier applications to microservices applications.
The reason they do that is there is 1 part of the spring framework called Spring Boot which is insanely popular amongst Java developers that are
wanting to go to microservices and modern application frameworks.

In fact, we have a website where Java developers can start the journey. It's called start.spring.io. We get on average 36 projects started every minute,
every minute. That's how popular Spring is with the community that wants to move to modern applications. So we think we are supremely well
positioned with taking the modern Java developer there. The other part, of course, is where these applications end up running is in Kubernetes
and Kubernetes infrastructure. And with our acquisition of Heptio, with our investments in Kubernetes by putting Kubernetes into every vSphere,
we think we are very well positioned to be the leading Kubernetes player in the marketplace. And in fact, we are one of the leading communities
contributors already. We're the #2 contributor. So if you think of VMware as vSphere, your argument is probably -- your concern is probably correct.
If you think of VMware as Kubernetes and Spring in modern applications, then you start to form a very different picture. Ajay, do you want to add
anything?

Ajay Patel - VMware, Inc. - SVP of Product Development - Cloud Services
I think you did a brilliant job. I think just like Java. If you look at enterprise developers, they fit in 2 cans, .Net and Java. Spring is universally with the
partnership with Microsoft with this latest one we did the Steeltoe announcement this week. We are giving customers that choice and the enterprise
developer wants to move to the cloud and microservices, the fastest way to do that is using Spring, Spring Boot. Spring Boot is built around some
of the Netflix OSS libraries. We commercialize those and we standardize those first in the Spring community and then commercialize those through
the Spring platform. So that's really bringing the Java traditional 3-tier to microservices with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud or. Net and Java Community
is really the biggest franchise that VMware is set up uniquely to go after. And you'll see a set of offerings around that and the announcements we
made this week. And the momentum with SpringOne was amazing. 41,000, right? 4x or 5x over even last year. So constantly seeing tremendous
momentum there as well.

Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
So by the way, one other point on the Kubernetes. 40% of Kubernetes workloads tend to be stateful workloads or machine learning workloads and
so on and so forth. So you can also see the synergy between what we're trying to do in Kubernetes in modern application development and the
NVIDIA announcement that Pat talked about. There are 2 million CUDA developers that are building AI applications. And as Pat said, we're going
to be democratizing AI by bringing it into the enterprise. The enterprise penetration of AI is probably around 10%, according to our friends from
NVIDIA. And so if you think about all of those 2 million CUDA developers growing, they're going to grow on top of Kubernetes and VMware and
of course, the NVIDIA next-gen cloud framework, which is built into -- which will be built into our Kubernetes offerings as part of the NVIDIA
collaboration. So we think we've got a very good base going forward of Kubernetes, Java and next-gen AI. And that's what's going to carry us into
developer mindshare.

Ajay Patel - VMware, Inc. - SVP of Product Development - Cloud Services
Yes, Raghu, it just reminded to me, yes, it's the best-kept secret also is we're the #2 open source committer for PostgreSQL. And another trend we're
seeing in the shift to cloud the adoption of open source databases PostgreSQL in particular, that's another asset in community we have. So you'll
start to see us tie these pieces together more effectively for the enterprise developer.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Great. We're going to have 1 more here that's kind of trying to pull together a number of different questions, but it's customer-focused. There are
clearly many great customer use cases profile during VMworld. To hear it from management. Could you talk more about early feedback from

                                                                                                                                                                             
 customers on the application modernization, are customers seeing a path to making VMware their cloud plus on-prem -- excuse me, cloud plus
on-premises agnostic manager. If not yet, how are you getting them there? And lastly, what other strategies is management taking to increase
while you cover this recognition in the developer community?

Rangarajan Raghuram - VMware, Inc. - COO of Products & Cloud Services
Yes. So I'll start again, and Ajay can add on. So as the question pointed out, customers are all looking at their application portfolio, and they're
saying, how am I going to modernize. And typically, they follow what we call the 5 hours. So they look at their portfolio, obviously, there are certain
set of applications that because of Pat's 3 laws is going to run in the data center. We need a modern infrastructure and a private cloud there. So
that's one set of applications. The second set of applications, they say, look, we want to move into from a traditional hardware environment into
either a private cloud or to a public cloud, but largely as is, and that's where the VMware Cloud assets and the VCF assets come into play. VMware
Cloud assets already hyperscaler, but they come into play.

The third set of thing they do is we want to containerize and move certain applications into containers as the first step towards microservices
creation. And our investments in Tanzu Kubernetes is great and Tanzu Mission Control turn out to be very vital there. And then last but not the
least, sorry, I'll talk about the remaining 2 are. The fourth one is refactoring and rebuilding these applications. And like I talked before if it is an
enterprise Java application around Spring and the traditional Tanzu application services helps them do that. And then the last one is retire. And
typically, what that means is they're not going to run those applications anymore, but they instead go into a SaaS provider. When they go to a SaaS
provider, then our end user computing Workspace ONE technologies and our VeloCloud technologies become super critical. So we think we are
very uniquely positioned in helping our customers with every part of that application journey, point number one. Point number two, and wherever
their application journey takes them, whether it takes them to the private cloud, whether it takes them to AWS or Azure or Alibaba or Google or
Oracle or IBM or any of the VCPP partners.

And once they've moved there, we can surround it with the strategy of not only helping them build and run their applications but also manage,
connect and protect. So we think we have a very comprehensive strategy for a customer's application modernization. Ajay?

Ajay Patel - VMware, Inc. - SVP of Product Development - Cloud Services
Yes. So to add to that, Raghu, again. There are 2 parts. One is we're also building a cloud navigator tool that allows the portfolio analysis upfront
because part of the customer is looking for like, what is my current workload portfolio look like? And what should I do across the 5 R's, across each
of those, right? So that's really one tooling we're providing. And then the second part we're doing is, we're finding that customers saying, when I
move to cloud, I need the ability to operate the infrastructure in such a way that is more cloud friendly, meaning I do now have dynamic infrastructure.
And you shut down my infrastructure if it's not in use. So being able to kind of bring a modern CICD delivery model, being able to operate this in
the cloud also leads nicely to the Kubernetes and the continuation work that Raghu talked about. And the last bit we're seeing is enabling through
partners. We're starting to have strategic conversation with the biggest system integrators or saying we need a strategic partner here that allows
us to play in a multi-cloud world to drive these 5 R's.

And you'll start to see kind of app modernization factories being created leveraging the Tanzu and the VMware Cloud portfolio. So the scale element
you ask for is going to be coming to both VMware and our Pivotal Labs capability in our VMware Services are moving towards this platform
development, platform deployment and application rehosting and refactoring. So we're lining up our services to support that, but also scale our
SI community, so they can start helping our customers scale. So you'll see a combination of VMware met and VMware enabled ecosystem partners
with ISV is playing a big role. So a good example we saw this week is the GitLab announcement. As you move to modern cloud, you want to run
in on Git apps or Git ops reporting environment. So we're going to bring some key ISVs who will also see public cloud as a threat and see VMware
as a great partner in this multi-cloud journey. So leveraging the ISV ecosystem, the open source community, the ISV, these are all accelerants to
the VMware strategy in addition to the CSP or the public cloud partnerships who are already established, that becomes a platform.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Thank you, Ajay, and thank you, Raghu. We're going to shift over to Rajiv to cover networking, EUC and security. I'll just mention here that we may
-- we're getting close to the end of our 10 more minutes to our scheduled end, and we'll probably run another 5, 10 minutes past that because we
don't want to shortchange these topic areas. We got a lot of great questions, in particular on security rolling in. So Rajiv, please go ahead and start.
PRESENTATION
Rajiv Ramaswami - VMware, Inc. - Former COO of Products & Cloud Services
Thank you, Paul. So we set out on this journey on security by really changing how security gets delivered. We've talked about this concept of
intrinsic security, which is really building security into every component of the infrastructure that people are already deploying versus bolting it
on top and also trying to minimize the number of different security solutions you need to put together, our products you need to put together to
go deliver security to the enterprise. And now we are on this journey, and what you'll see here are proof points along the way of execution along
that journey and also solving some important new problems that have come up even over the last year. For example, with the pandemic now,
we're all in this model of a distributed workforce. We think that, that distributed workforce is actually here to stay. It's not going to go away even
if the pandemic goes away. And so securing that distributed workforce becomes a key imperative now.

And some of these things require a combination of many things, right? It requires you to have a presence in terms of the employee experience
and the endpoints. It needs endpoint security. It needs network connectivity. It needs cloud security. And all of these solutions are starting to come
together, and that's really what we're delivering here in terms of some of the major new announcements at VMworld. So the first of these
announcements is what we call our VMware Secure Access Service Edge platform. And it really is the foundation for that distributed future-ready
workforce. And fundamentally, what it does is it's a combination of 3 solutions -- 3 things coming together into a solution. Workspace One, digital
workspace, providing the employee engagement and also remote access capability from the user into wherever their apps are running, whether
it be in the public cloud or whether it's in the data center. SD-WAN, providing network connectivity, both into branch offices, but also now into
homes. In fact, many of us here on this call myself, Raghu, Pat, all of us have SD-WAN boxes at home, and we're talking to you through those boxes.
Right. So the second element is SD-WAN.

And the third element is security. And when I say security, it is remote access. It is firewalling, and it is web security. And it's really the ability to put
those 3 things together into a single unified solution, easy to manage fully integrated solution. That's really what we've announced with VMware
SASE platform. And they're delivering those set of capabilities through a network of pops, points of presence, that we manage around the world,
about 150 of these, where all of these functions are getting delivered and managed as a cloud service. So this is really modern security built in,
delivered so that you can have productive and safe end-user experience. Now as part of this SASE platform, we have many of the components
ourselves. We have the digital workspace. We have our SD-WAN solution. We have our NSX based firewall solution that's getting better every day
here. And there was one missing component, and that was web security. And this is where we announced 2 partnerships at VMworld. The first is
a partnership with Menlo Security, and the second is with Zscaler. We are taking Menlo Security's secure web gateway functions and a more browser
isolation capabilities, integrating that and delivering that. We are oeming their product line and delivering it as an integrated experience, single
pane of glass for our customers.

In addition, we recognize that many of our customers are using Zscaler for their web security. As Zscaler is the market leader in web security. So
we have a preferred partnership where it's a best-of-breed solution with our SD-WAN, our remote access with Workspace ONE, our firewalls,
combined with Zscaler's web security functions. Those 2 will come together, seamlessly interoperate, work together for our customers. And that
is a Zscaler partnership.

Now the other big announcement here was Carbon Black workload protection. What we -- what we're doing with Carbon Black, once we bought
it, it's very well integrated now. We are really truly delivering on integrating that both on the workload side and on the endpoint side. Carbon Black
workload protection builds in security, workload security as part -- natively as part of vSphere. So at this point, any vSphere deployment can simply
with the latest upgrade here, could actually get workload protection now completely agentless built in.
                                                                                                                                                                             
 For the next 6 months, we are offering that free to all our customers. It provides basic vulnerability management. It provides a full suite of endpoint
protection, next-generation antivirus detection and response and much, much simpler operations that allow IT to be simplified. And so we're really
excited about that announcement here. We're delivering on that as a major premise behind our acquisition of Carbon Black, and now we're delivering
on that.

On the workspace security, the same thing, right? We are now integrating Carbon Black with Workspace ONE. Where we see the different silos of
endpoint management and endpoint security really coming together to drive a single unified solution. We are delivering that for endpoint protection
and endpoint management, together with Workspace ONE. We're also delivering that as part of our integrated VDI offerings. And last but not the
least here, NSX firewalling, this is the last-line acquisition, we keep improving the firewall capabilities that we have. Now our firewalls now include
advance threat protection, which really look at network threats. We have an AI/ML engine running in the cloud. It can analyze these threats and
provide suitable responses. So net-net here, what we're bringing together is we're taking all of these disparate pieces of security, bringing them
together, integrating them into the infrastructure that we provide and creating a simpler way for our customers to consume these.

Last but not the least is the statement of future direction. We talked about how all of these security solutions are now built into the infrastructure.
The last missing piece is an end-to-end analytics play here, security analytics that's able to correlate what's happening in the endpoint with what's
happening in the network and what's happening in the cloud. And we announced a future direction there called XDR, extended detection response,
which really correlates across all of these points. So that's our security news here. I'll pass there and take questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Thanks, Rajiv. Let's start with a broad question. Pat, this has addressed specifically to you. Pat, you made a long list of security announcements.
Good. You have a presence in the cloud, on-premise and on the Edge. Can you talk about the evolution of security? What you think you can and
can't do long-term and what way is your approach going to be different versus the pure security players?

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. The key thing and Rajiv was touching on this in his comments there, is the idea of integrating security into the fabric of what we do. We're
going to integrate it to Tanzu, integrate it to vSphere, integrated to NSX, integrate it to Workspace ONE. And in doing so, our customers need less
products, less solutions, less operations people, less things that they're putting together in their environment. And that's the core of -- you'll hear
it called zero trust security, intrinsic security, bringing more and more of those capabilities together. That's the strategy that we're on. And for it
customers, while, hey, we're still early in the journey, they're getting pretty excited, right, that this really is making their lives substantially easier
as we go forward. Now against that, we definitely -- we're not done yet. We have releases coming out like we acquired Octarine to essentially do
workload protection like we're doing for vSphere, but for containers as well.

That's not shipping yet. Patrick and his team, right, are working like crazy to get that one done. I was pushing him really hard, ""hey, I want to
announce workload and container at the same time."" So right, we're pushing our teams aggressively. There's lots of things that we have yet to do
to finish the Workspace ONE and Carbon Black integration as well. And this last piece that Rajiv was talking about, the XDR area. That's just almost
an open field for us to go for. So you're going to see a lot more in that area as well. And that said, there's things that we're not going to do. We have
no plans to ever go into mail security, right? It's a fairly well-established identity, paying Okta and what Microsoft does, hey, we're going to partner
in those areas.

There's a number of areas where we're going to say, we're going to do world-class integrations, and many of those are already done, and we're
going to build those partnered relationships even as the core workload, the core endpoint management, those are areas that we're going to be
very, very focused on. And if you've seen the control point slide that we often use and is very prominent in our keynotes, sort of lays out where we
are and where we're not. And obviously, this is an area of organic but we also expect that we'll do some more inorganic moves here over time as
                                                                                                                                                                             
 well. But all of those is not going to be a bag of parts like Symantec became that never were integrated together. Everyone that we do is going to
how do we integrate it into that overall intrinsic security strategy.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Thanks, Pat. Rajiv, this is probably more for you here. Zscaler, talk more about that importance, please, some more on the details and the customer
benefits?

Rajiv Ramaswami - VMware, Inc. - Former COO of Products & Cloud Services
Yes. So again, customers are really changing how they do security. So I'll give you a simple example today. If you are maybe working at home in
San Francisco, working for a financial services company in New York that happens to have a data center out there in New York. You are VPN-ing
into your data center today. And from the data center, there's a whole set of security appliances that are stitched together, whether it be a firewall,
whether it be Blue Coat type security -- web security appliance. Those are all stitched together. And from there, you might be actually accessing a
Zoom session that's actually running in AWS perhaps somewhere on the West Coast. That's the situation today.

Now if you look at how modern security is going to be delivered going forward, you don't want to do this. This is super inefficient, right? And it
doesn't give you that great protection. So the way security is changing is now traffic is coming from users, wherever you are, working at home,
working from a Starbucks store or wherever it is, from your mobile device or from your PC, traffic goes directly into one of our points of presence.
That point of presence, you apply all the security filtering that you need. And what we do with Zscaler from an integration perspective is once we
direct the traffic from Workspace ONE into our SD-WAN into our setup box. From there, we are now able to hand the traffic off to Zscaler, who run
in their setup box to be able to do the best-in-class web security functions. And then hand the traffic off to whether it needs to go to Zoom or
whether it needs to go to your Office 365.

So the partnership with Zscaler is around mutual referencing because Zscaler will be referencing our SD-WAN and our Remote Access Solutions
as part of their full solution. We will be bringing in and interoperating with Zscaler and many Zscaler accounts where Zscaler has got about 5,000-plus
customers, very large customers. And for that set of customers, we'll be able to deliver a truly integrated experience. Where these 2 solutions come
together into a single sign-on, seamless handoff of traffic so that from a customer's perspective, it's going to look like it's one single solution.

Thanks, Rajiv. Patrick, you may want to jump in for this next one. It's your favorite topic, I think. Carbon Black Cloud workload, please expand on
this opportunity and anything you might add about pricing?

Patrick Morley - VMware, Inc. - Senior VP & GM of Security Business Unit
Yes. I think, obviously, Pat and Rajiv both did a nice job covering it. It's certainly -- we're certainly very excited. And I -- again, we are just about a
year at post-acquisition of Carbon Black, and this VMworld is really a coming-out party for us, where we made a set of commitments around how
we were building security in. And obviously, we're delivering against that, and we're really excited, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, as Pat
described, with containers, et cetera. But we can see it all in front of us. And our customers are really excited about it as well. I was on a customer
briefing yesterday, explaining what we're doing with workloads. And the customer said, well, we are always chasing our tail on this and by building
it in, you allow us to dramatically reduce the amount of overhead.

And I fundamentally think about workloads as providing 2 big value adds. First one is better protection, better security. And the second one is
better pricing, better cost because instead of having all these different products that I have to manage, and as the customer said, chase my tail, it's
all there for them built in. And so the way that we're implementing this is that in the Carbon Black console, I can look across my entire estate of
VMs, and I can instantly understand where the risk is across that environment. And oh, by the way, for the V admin who's in vSphere, they can do

                                                                                                                                                                             
 the same thing. They have the same visibility and can look across and understand security, the security posture of all their VMs. So we're not just
taking all the telemetry from across the VMware estate and putting it into Carbon Black. We're creating connection points between the practitioners
in each part of the estate that touch security. And as we all know, increasingly, more and more teams are touching security. It's not just the infosec
team. The infrastructure team now is being asked to look at security. DevOps teams are being asked to consider security. Network, desktop services,
et cetera. So customers are excited about what we're offering. And the pricing is going to be on a per CPU basis, list price is $500 per CPU per year.

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
And just to add one point there. Our objective is 100% attach rate to vSphere, right? This should be in every single vSphere VM should be taking
advantage of this. So we have very high aspirations to drive a very high attach rate. We see that just as a nice almost ASP bump to the vSphere
franchise.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Let's get 1 more security question in before we go to a general question because we're getting a little bit past our time here. This is regarding our
Dell partnership. The Dell partnership has been very successful in growing new channels with solutions like VxRail and end user computing. How
is the Dell distribution impacting the security solutions, in particular, Carbon Black?

Rajiv Ramaswami - VMware, Inc. - Former COO of Products & Cloud Services
Yes. Maybe, Patrick, you can cover that.

Patrick Morley - VMware, Inc. - Senior VP & GM of Security Business Unit
Yes. So one of the things that we did right away in coming into VMware as we met with the team at Dell and walked them through our product
strategy and what we're doing. And as we've talked about in the past, one of the big motions that we've seen is this thing we call on the box. So
that's essentially Dell sellers saying to their customers is security important to you? And if it is, you should be using Carbon Black, VMware Carbon
Black. And we've really been excited by the uptake of that. And I don't know looking at Pat for direction. I don't know that we've broken it up out.
We've given overall customer count numbers in the last earnings call, which was 20,000 customers for Carbon Black. Just to give you a sense, if you
rewind a year ago, we had about 5,000 customers. So that obviously, the Dell portion of -- for being able to drive some of that volume, Dell has
been a nice contributor for that. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing. And I think long term, we have more opportunity with Dell beyond
just again, that volume business also with strategic accounts across the large globals that are buying for Dell.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Great. Thanks, Patrick. Let's get one more general question in here that any of you could pick up on or all. And before we have kind of a wrap-up
from Pat.

With virtual conference with the settings now with virtual teleconferencing, how are we getting new product ideas that we would otherwise get
from one-on-one customer dialogue.

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Sorry, I had to unmute there. Clearly, we're seeing that the amount of touches we can do with customers has increased not decreased. Now obviously,
VMworld is sort of say, it is a little bit different. We're not running room to room and having customer conversations like we would have had with
VMworld. But we've actually had a tremendous amount of increase in the number of customers participating, right, and customers might have

                                                                                                                                                                             
 said 10 people before. Now they have 30 people or 40 people participating online. We've also seen that the number of briefings that we're having
are increasing very markedly and the participation from the customers in those briefing is increasing marketably as well. Because they can, right?
It's easy now. You're not moving and they're not -- everybody is online and everybody is being able to do virtually. I'll say my personal customer
touches are up 2.5 to 3x since the pandemic began. So it really is a market increase in the amount that we're able to do.

Now obviously, it's different, right. And we're figuring out how to do remote POCs and some of the support engagements and figuring out how
to do that without as much physical presence. So we're having to adjust some of our things and how we do labs and other things as well. But so
far, we're seeing that, that activity that we spoke about maybe back in Q2, right, is dropping off, is picking up very nicely as they're adjusting, and
we're adjusting and this urgency that they have for building out their digital foundation and some of the things that Rajiv and Raghu touched on.
Boy, there's a lot of interest in these things. How do I secure -- my VPNs now are being crushed under the workload, how do I now build a new
architecture? How do I accelerate my cloud movements? Many of these projects are well underway. We're figuring out how to have those customer
conversations. And clearly, as you've seen in the extraordinary amount of customers giving testimonials and participating at VMworld. This is by
far the greatest customer engagement that we've ever had at a VMworld conference.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Anything else you'd like to say in terms of a wrap up, Pat or should we end it here?

Patrick P. Gelsinger - VMware, Inc. - CEO & Director
Yes. Maybe just to conclude, again, we're super excited to be able to spend time with you, and many of you, we consider friends. At this point,
we've interacted over a number of years, both in the sell and the buy side. We really feel like many of the things that we've talked about for a
number of years, like telco. When I first started talking about it, most of you said, huh? What are you -- 4 years ago and now it's starting to materialize.
When we did our VeloCloud acquisition. What are you guys doing, right, in this space? And now you're seeing SASE emerge. When we started to
lay out Kubernetes, oh, pieces are in place. And when we announced our Amazon partnership, sort of like, huh, is that going to work out for you?
And what about the other hyperscale? They're all there now. So many of the things that we've talked about over several years now are materializing
at scale. And the customer testimonials, the passion that they're seeing for it. We really feel it so many ways that this is our time. And the digital
foundation for an unpredictable world, we're well positioned for this unpredictable world, and our customers want more and more of what we're
doing. Thank you for joining us today. Always a pleasure to interact.

Paul Ziots - VMware, Inc. - VP of IR
Thank you, Pat. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Again, the replay is on -- will be on ir.vmware.com. Thank you.
